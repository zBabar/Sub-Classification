Class	Subject	abstractStroke	OUTC	"Our objective was to identify factors that contribute to or modify the sex difference in poststroke functional outcome.Ischemic strokes (n=439) were identified from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project (2008-2011). Data were ascertained from interviews (baseline and 90 days post stroke) and medical records. Functional outcome was measured as an average of 22 activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental ADL items (range, 1-4; higher scores worse function). Tobit regression was used to estimate sex differences and to identify confounding and modifying factors.Fifty-one percent were women. Median age was 71 (interquartile range, 59-80) years in women and 64 (interquartile range, 56-77) years in men. Median ADL/instrumental ADL score at 90 days was 2.7 (interquartile range, 1.8-3.6) in women and 2.0 (interquartile range, 1.3-3.1) in men (P<0.01); this difference remained after age-adjustment (P<0.001). Factors contributing to higher ADL/instrumental ADL scores in women included prestroke function, marital status, prestroke cognition, nursing home residence, stroke severity, history of stroke/transient ischemic attack, and body mass index; prestroke function was the largest contributor. Stroke severity modified the sex difference in outcome such that differences were apparent for mild to moderate but not severe strokes. After adjustment, women still had significantly worse functional outcome than men.These findings yield insight into possible strategies and subgroups to target to reduce the sex disparity in stroke outcome; demographics and prestroke and clinical factors explained only 41% of the sex difference in stroke outcome highlighting the need for future research to identify modifiable factors that contribute to sex differences."Stroke	MANAG	"Sex differences in recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA) administration are present in some populations. It is unknown whether this is because of eligibility differences or the modifiable exclusion criterion of severe hypertension. Our aim was to investigate sex differences in r-tPA eligibility, in individual exclusion criteria, and in the modifiable exclusion criterion, hypertension.We included all ischemic stroke patients ‰ä´18 years among residents of the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region who presented to 16-area emergency departments in 2005. Eligibility for r-tPA and individual exclusion criteria were determined using 2013 American Heart Association (AHA) and European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) III guidelines.Of 1837 ischemic strokes, 58% were women, 24% were black. Mean age in years was 72.2 for women and 66.1 for men. Eligibility for r-tPA was similar by sex (6.8% men and 6.1% women; P=0.55), even after adjusting for age (7.0% and 5.9%; P=0.32). Similar proportions of women and men arrived beyond 3- and 4.5-hour time windows, but more women had severe hypertension. There were no sex differences in blood pressure treatment rates among those with severe hypertension (14.6% women and 20.8% men; P=0.21). More women were >80 years and had National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) >25.Within a large, biracial population, eligibility for r-tPA was similar by sex. Women were more likely to have the modifiable exclusion criterion of severe hypertension but were not more likely to be treated. Women were more likely to have 2 of the 5 ECASS III exclusion criteria. Undertreatment of hypertension in women is a potentially modifiable contributor to reported differences in r-tPA administration."Stroke	PP	"Sex differences are well known in cerebral ischemia and may impact the effect of stroke treatments. In male rats, the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 reduces ischemia-induced endothelin type B (ETB) receptor upregulation, infarct size and improves acute neurologic function after experimental stroke. However, responses to this treatment in females and long-term effects on outcome are not known. Initial experiments used in vitro organ culture of cerebral arteries, confirming ERK1/2 activation and increased ETB receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in female cerebral arteries. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO, 120‰Ûäminutes) was induced in female Wistar rats, with U0126 (30‰Ûämg/kg intraperitoneally) or vehicle administered at 0 and 24‰Ûähours of reperfusion, or with no treatment. Infarct volumes were determined and neurologic function was assessed by 6-point and 28-point neuroscores. ETB receptor-mediated contraction was studied with myograph and protein expression with immunohistochemistry. In vitro organ culture and tMCAO resulted in vascular ETB receptor upregulation and activation of ERK1/2 that was prevented by U0126. Although no effect on infarct size, U0126 improved the long-term neurologic function after experimental stroke in female rats. In conclusion, early prevention of the ERK1/2 activation and ETB receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in the cerebral vasculature after ischemic stroke in female rats improves the long-term neurologic outcome. "Stroke	EPI	"Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a potential candidate for cardiovascular disease. To date the genetic association of VDR with ischemic stroke has not been explored. In the present study we aimed to evaluate the association between VDR gene variants and ischemic stroke in Asian Indian population. Overall, 557 subjects were investigated that included 313 ischemic stroke patients and 244 control subjects. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms of the VDR gene termed as Fok I, Apa I, Taq I and Bsm I were genotyped by using PCR-RFLP method. The genotype distribution of Bsm I polymorphism was found to deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in control subjects, and hence excluded from the study. Apa I and Taq I polymorphisms were not found to be associated with ischemic stroke. However, presence of ff genotype of Fok I was found to confer 2.97-fold risk of ischemic stroke (95% CI=1.16-7.63, P=0.02) as compared to FF genotype. This association was found to be independent of various demographic and important biochemical covariates including age, gender, smoking, alcohol intake, BMI, and serum glucose, lipid profile, insulin and HOMA-IR, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and plasma NOx levels [OR=2.27, 95% CI=1.25-4.09, P=0.01]. However, adjustment for lipid metabolites attenuated the genetic association [OR=1.68, 95% CI=0.75-3.78, P=0.21]. Fok I polymorphism was also found to be associated with total cholesterol levels; ff genotype carriers were found to have significantly higher cholesterol levels (203.56 å± 30.50mg/dl) as compared to FF carriers (177.38 å± 47.90 mg/dl) (P=0.04). On stratification by gender the genetic association between Fok I polymorphism and ischemic stroke remained significant in females only (OR=2.28, 95% CI=1.15-4.53, P=0.02). This genetic association was also found to attenuate on adjustment with lipid variables. In the present study we could associate the only known functional polymorphism of VDR i.e., Fok I, with ischemic stroke in a gender specific manner. Adjustment with lipid variables was found to attenuate this association indicating that impaired lipid metabolism may be the underlying mechanism of action of this polymorphism which leads to an increase in the risk of ischemic stroke. Further larger scale validations in other population are warranted in other population."Stroke	PP	"The peripheral immune response contributes to neurodegeneration after stroke yet little is known about how this process differs between males and females. The current study demonstrates that splenectomy prior to experimental stroke eliminates sex differences in infarct volume and activated brain monocytes/microglia. In the periphery of both sexes, activated T cells correlate directly with stroke outcome while monocytes are reduced by splenectomy only in males. This study provides new information about the sex specific mechanisms of the peripheral immune response in neurodegeneration after stroke and demonstrates the need for representation of both sexes in basic and clinical stroke research. "Stroke	PP	"Stroke in the developing brain is an important cause of neurological morbidity. We determined the impact of human cord blood-derived CD34(+)-enriched mononuclear cells (CBSC) intraperitoneally injected 48‰Ûäh after an ischemic stroke at postnatal day 12 by evaluating poststroke neurogenic niche proliferation, glial response, and recovery in CD1 mice. Percent brain atrophy was quantified from Nissl-stained sections. Density of BrdU, Iba-1, and GFAP staining were quantified in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). Immunohistochemistry for human nuclear antibody, human mitochondrial antibody, and human CD34(+) cells was done on injured and uninjured brains from CBSC- and vehicle-treated mice. Developmental neurobehavioral milestones were evaluated pre- and post-treatment. No significant differences in stroke severity were noted between CBSC and vehicle-treated injured animals. With a 1ÌÑ10(5) CBSC dose, there was a significant increase in subgranular zone (SGZ) proliferation in the CBSC-versus vehicle-treated stroke-injured male mice. SVZ glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression was increased contralaterally in injured females treated with CBSC but suppressed in injured males. Significant negative correlations between severity of the stroke-injury and spleen weights, and between spleen weights and SGZ proliferation, and a positive correlation between GFAP expression and severity of brain injury were noted in the vehicle-treated injured mice but not in the CBSC-treated mice. GFAP expression and SVZ proliferation were positively correlated. In conclusion, neurogenic niche proliferation and glial brain responses to CBSC after neonatal stroke may involve interactions with the spleen and are sex dependent. "Stroke	MANAG	"Studies have shown gender disparities in cholesterol care in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), with women less likely than men to have low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels <100åÊmg/dl. Whether this is related to a lower evidence-based statin or high-intensity statin use is not known. We used a national cohort of 972,532 patients with CVD (coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, and ischemic stroke) receiving care in 130 Veterans Health Administration facilities from October 1, 2010, to September 30, 2011, to identify the proportion of male and female patients with CVD receiving any statin and high-intensity statin. Women with CVD (nåÊ= 13,371) were less likely than men to receive statins (57.6% vs 64.8%, p <0.0001) or high-intensity statins (21.1% vs 23.6%, p <0.0001). Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (99 vs 85åÊmg/dl) were higher in women compared with men (p <0.0001). In adjusted models, female gender was independently associated with a lower likelihood of receiving statins (odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.71) or high-intensity statins (odds ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.80). The median facility-level rate of statin and high-intensity statin use among female patients (57.3% [interquartile rangeåÊ= 8.93%] for statin, 20% [interquartile rangeåÊ= 7.7%] for high-intensity statin use) showed significant variation. In conclusion, women with CVD are less likely to receive evidence-based statin and high-intensity statins compared with men, although, their use remains low in both genders. There is a significant facility-level variation in evidence-based statin or high-intensity statin use in female patients with CVD. With the ""statin dose-based approach"" proposed by the recent cholesterol guidelines, these results highlight areas for quality improvement. "Stroke	REVIEW	"The steroid hormone 17b-estradiol and the peptide hormone insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 independently exert neuroprotective actions in neurologic diseases such as stroke. Only a few studies have directly addressed the interaction between the two hormone systems, however, there is a large literature that indicates potentially greater interactions between the 17b-estradiol and IGF-1 systems. The present review focuses on key issues related to this interaction including IGF-1 and sex differences and common activation of second messenger systems. Using ischemic stroke as a case study, this review also focuses on independent and cooperative actions of estrogen and IGF-1 on neuroprotection, blood brain barrier integrity, angiogenesis, inflammation and post-stroke epilepsy. Finally, the review also focuses on the astrocyte, a key mediator of post stroke repair, as a local source of 17b-estradiol and IGF-1. This review thus highlights areas where significant new research is needed to clarify the interactions between these two neuroprotectants. "Stroke	MANAG	"Previous literature has shown gender disparities in the care of acute ischemic stroke. Compared to men, women wait longer for brain imaging and are less likely to receive intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Emergency department (ED) triage is an important step in the rapid assessment of stroke patients and is a possible contributor to disparities. It is unknown whether gender differences exist in ED triage of acute stroke patients. Our primary objective was to determine whether gender disparities exist in the triage of acute stroke patients as defined by Emergency Severity Index (ESI) levels and use of ED critical care beds.This was a retrospective, observational study of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients age ‰ä´18 years presenting to a large, urban, academic ED within six hours of symptom onset between January 2010, and December 2012. Primary outcomes were triage to a non-critical ED bed and Emergency Severity Index (ESI) level. Primary outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records by a blinded data manager; secondary outcome data and covariates were abstracted by trained research assistants. We performed bivariate and multivariate analyses. Logistic regression was performed using age, race, insurance status, mode of and time to arrival, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and presence of atypical symptoms as covariates.There were 537 patients included in this study. Women were older (75.6 vs. 69.5, p<0.001), and more women had a history of atrial fibrillation (39.8% vs. 25.3%, p<0.001). Compared to 9.5% of men, 10.3% of women were triaged to a non-critical care ED bed (p=0.77); 92.1% of women were triaged as ESI 1 or 2 vs. 93.6% of men (p=0.53). After adjustment, gender was not associated with triage location or ESI level, though atypical symptoms were associated with higher odds of being triaged to a non-critical care bed (aOR 1.98, 95%CI [1.03 - 3.81]) and 3.04 times higher odds of being triaged as ESI 3 vs. ESI 1 or 2 (95% CI [1.36 - 6.82]).In a large, urban, academic ED at a primary stroke center, there were no gender differences in triage to critical care beds or ESI levels among acute stroke patients arriving within six hours of symptom onset. These findings suggest that ED triage protocols for stroke patients may be effective in minimizing gender disparities in care."Stroke	MANAG	"Minocycline as an antibiotic has been found to have neuroprotective effect on neurodegenerative diseases. This study was aimed at determining the efficacy of minocycline adjunct to aspirin in improving neurological outcomes of ischemic stroke during 3-month follow-up.In an open-label evaluator-blinded trial, 60 patients with ischemic stroke were allocated into two groups to receive either 200 mg of oral minocycline daily for 5 days during 6-24 h following onset of signs and symptoms, or not receiving any, as control; all patients also received 100 mg of aspirin daily. Clinical assessment at baseline and on days 30, 60, and 90 was performed using National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score.Fifty-three patients (88.3%) completed the study. Females in the treatment and control groups were 53.8% and 51.9%, respectively (P = 0.884). Among all patients, NIHSS score was significantly lower in the minocycline-treated compared with control on day 90 (minocycline median 4, interquartile range 4-7, control median 7, interquartile range 5-8, P = 0.031). Among males, NIHSS was lower in minocycline-treated compared with controls on days 30, 60, and 90 (P < 0.05); however, females showed no significant differences at the same times compared with controls. No adverse outcomes including myocardial infarction, recurrent stroke, and mortality were observed in the both groups.Patients with ischemic stroke who received oral minocycline daily for 5 days had significantly better neurological outcomes on day 90 than controls. However, females showed no significant clinical improvement compared to males."Stroke	MANAG	"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on lipid lowering, cardiovascular (CV) events, and adverse events in women compared with men in 6 clinical trials. In the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL) trial (atorvastatin 80 mg vs simvastatin 20 to 40 mg), the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial (atorvastatin 80 vs 10 mg), the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial (atorvastatin 80 mg vs placebo), and the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), and the Atorvastatin Study for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (ASPEN) (atorvastatin 10 mg vs placebo), lipid changes on treatment were compared between genders with studies grouped by dose. The association of on-study low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and CV events by gender was evaluated in the combined studies and the impact of gender on adverse events in each study separately. Major CV events occurred in 3,083 of 30,000 men (10.3%) and 823 of 9,173 women (9.0%). Changes in lipids were similar in women and men. Major CV events were associated with gender-specific quintiles of on-treatment LDL cholesterol for women and men. In women, LDL cholesterol was a significant predictor of stroke, but not in men. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were higher in women in 4 of 6 trials, but in only 1 trial was a significant treatment-gender interaction seen. Myalgia rates were slightly higher in women in both statin and placebo groups. In conclusion, the response of women to atorvastatin was similar to that of men, with slightly more discontinuations due to adverse events. Higher on-treatment LDL cholesterol was significantly associated with more CV events in both genders, but the association was stronger for stroke in women and for coronary heart disease death in men."Stroke	OUTC	"Variable sex differences in clinical outcomes after stroke have been reported worldwide. This study aimed to elucidate whether sex is an independent risk factor of poor functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke.Using the database of patients with acute stroke registered in the Fukuoka Stroke Registry in Japan from 1999 to 2013, 6236 previously independent patients with first-ever ischemic stroke who were admitted within 24 hours of onset were included in this study. Baseline characteristics were assessed on admission. Study outcomes included neurological improvement, neurological deterioration, and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 3-6 at discharge). Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between sex and clinical outcomes.Overall, 2398 patients (38.5%) were women. Severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, ‰ä´8) on admission was more prevalent in women than in men. The frequency of neurological improvement or deterioration during hospitalization was not different between the sexes. After adjusting for possible confounders, including age, stroke subtype and severity, risk factors, and poststroke treatments, it was found that female sex was independently associated with poor functional outcome at discharge (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.57). There was heterogeneity of the association between sex and poor outcome according to age: women had higher risk of poor outcome than men among patients aged ‰ä´70 years, but no clear sex difference was found in patients aged <70 years.Female sex was associated with the risk of poor functional outcome at discharge after acute ischemic stroke."Stroke	PP	"Epidemiologic studies have shown sex differences in ischemic stroke. The four core genotype (FCG) mouse model, in which the testes determining gene, Sry, has been moved from Y chromosome to an autosome, was used to dissociate the effects of sex hormones from sex chromosome in ischemic stroke outcome. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in gonad intact FCG mice revealed that gonadal males (XXM and XYM) had significantly higher infarct volumes as compared with gonadal females (XXF and XYF). Serum testosterone levels were equivalent in adult XXM and XYM, as was serum estrogen in XXF and XYF mice. To remove the effects of gonadal hormones, gonadectomized FCG mice were subjected to MCAO. Gonadectomy significantly increased infarct volumes in females, while no change was seen in gonadectomized males, indicating that estrogen loss increases ischemic sensitivity. Estradiol supplementation in gonadectomized FCG mice rescued this phenotype. Interestingly, FCG male mice were less sensitive to effects of hormones. This may be due to enhanced expression of the transgene Sry in brains of FCG male mice. Sex differences in ischemic stroke sensitivity appear to be shaped by organizational and activational effects of sex hormones, rather than sex chromosomal complement. "Stroke	EPI	"It is well-known that alcohol consumption is associated with stroke risk as well as with aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2) polymorphisms. However, it is unclear whether ALDH2 polymorphisms are associated with stroke risk independent of alcohol consumption and whether such association is modified by sex. We evaluated sex-specific associations of a common ALDH2 polymorphism and alcohol consumption with stroke risk in a Korean population.We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 8,465 men and women, aged 40-69 years and free of stroke between June, 2001 and January, 2003, and followed for the development of stroke. We identified new cases of stroke, which were self-reported or ascertained from vital registration data. Based on genome-wide association data, we selected a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2074356), which shows high linkage disequilibrium with the functional polymorphism of ALDH2. We conducted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis considering potential risk factors collected from a baseline questionnaire.Over the median follow-up of 8 years, 121 cases of stroke were identified. Carrying the wild-type allele of the ALDH2 polymorphism increased stroke risk among men. The multivariate hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] of stroke was 2.02 [1.03-3.99] for the wild-type allele compared with the mutant alleles, but the association was attenuated after controlling for alcohol consumption. Combinations of the wild-type allele and other risk factors of stroke, such as old age, diabetes mellitus, and habitual snoring, synergistically increased the risk among men. Among women, however, the ALDH2 polymorphism was not associated with stroke risk.The prospective cohort study showed a significant association between a common ALDH2 polymorphism and stroke risk in Korean men, but not in Korean women, and also demonstrated that men with genetic disadvantages gain more risk when having risk factors of stroke. Thus, these men may need to make more concerted efforts to control modifiable risk factors of stroke."Stroke	OUTC	"To seek if there is gender survival difference among patients treated with thrombolytic therapy.Cohort study.Community based register.91 subjects with an episode of stroke collected since April 2006 up to September 2013 and treated with thrombolytic therapy.Monitoring of vital status.We collected baseline characteristics in Framingham, Regicor, CHA2DS2-VASc, Essen, NIHSS, Barthel scales and outcomes according to gender; person-time incidence rate; survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier's curves, bivariate analysis between survivors and deaths, and Cox multivariate.91 patients with middle age 68.02å±11.9 years. The men have higher cardiovascular basal risk. The average time of follow-up was 2.95å±2.33 years. Incidence rate ratio (IR) shown higher risk in men than in women IR=3.2 (CI 95% 1.2-8.0). The dead cases were older (P=.032); with higher cardiovascular basal risk (P=.040) and more risk of stroke recurrence (P=<.001), with cardiovascular pathology before the stroke (P=.005); more stroke severity (P=.002); and a major fall in the score Barthel one year after the episode (P=.016). The percentage of deaths is significantly higher when the patient is referred by complications to other centres (P=.006) in relation to those referred to home, but just the gender (HR: 1,12; IC 95%: 1,05-1,20) and secondary cardiovascular prevention (HR: 0,13; IC 95%: 0,06-0,28) were associated with higher risk of mortality.After stroke episode treated with thrombolytic therapy, men have 12% higher risk of dying than women and don't be treated with secondary cardiovascular prevention rise 7.7 times the mortality risk."Stroke	CLIN	Stroke	PP	Stroke	REVIEW	"Stroke is the leading cause of acquired disability and the third leading cause of death in women worldwide. Sex differences in risk factors, treatment response and quality of life after stroke complicate stroke management in women. Women have an increased lifetime incidence of stroke compared to men, largely due to a sharp increase in stroke risk in older postmenopausal women. Women also have an increased lifetime prevalence of stroke risk factors, including hypertension and atrial fibrillation in postmenopausal women, as well as abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome in middle-aged women. Controversy continues over the risks of oral contraceptives, hormone therapy and surgical intervention for carotid stenosis in women. Pregnancy and the postpartum period represent a time of increased risk, presenting challenges to stroke management. Recognition of these issues is critical to improving acute care and functional recovery after stroke in women."Stroke	EPI	"In this study, we aimed to identify determinants of the different sex-related stroke risk in subjects with asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. In all, 492 women (44.4%) and 617 men (55.6%), with unilateral ‰©_ 60% asymptomatic ICA stenosis, were prospectively evaluated with a median follow-up of 37 months (interquartile range, 26 to 43). Vascular risk profile, plaque characteristics, stenosis progression, and common carotid artery intima-media thickness were investigated. Outcome measure was the occurrence of ischemic stroke ipsilateral to ICA stenosis. Myocardial infarction, contralateral stroke and transient ischemic attack were considered as competing events. The incidence rate of ipsilateral stroke over the entire follow-up period was 0.16%: 0.09% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.15) in women and 0.22% (95% CI 0.17 to 0.29) in men (log-rank test, P<0.001). Stenosis progression significantly influenced the risk of ipsilateral stroke in both men (subhazard ratio, SHR, 8.99) and women (SHR 4.89). Stenosis degree (71% to 90%, SHR 2.35; 91% to 99%, SHR 3.38) and irregular plaque surface (SHR 2.32) were relevant risk factors for ipsilateral stroke only in men. Our findings suggest that characteristics of the stenosis and plaque exert a different effect in modulating vascular risk in the two sexes. Understanding sex differences in cardiovascular disease could help to target sex-specific future therapies."Stroke	EPI	"Population-based data, which continuously monitors time trends in stroke epidemiology are limited. We investigated the incidence of pathological and etiological stroke subtypes over a 16 year time period.Data were collected within the Erlangen Stroke Project (ESPro), a prospective, population-based stroke register in Germany covering a total study population of 105,164 inhabitants (2010). Etiology of ischemic stroke was classified according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria.Between January 1995 and December 2010, 3,243 patients with first-ever stroke were documented. The median age was 75 and 55% were females. The total stroke incidence decreased over the 16 year study period in men (Incidence Rate Ratio 1995-1996 vs. 2009-2010 (IRR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.58-0.90) but not in women. Among stroke subtypes, a decrease in ischemic stroke incidence (IRR 0.73; 95% CI 0.57-0.93) and of large artery atherosclerotic stroke (IRR 0.27; 95% CI 0.12-0.59) was found in men and an increase of stroke due to small artery occlusion in women (IRR 2.33; 95% CI 1.39-3.90).Variations in time trends of pathological and etiological stroke subtypes were found between men and women that might be linked to gender differences in the development of major vascular risk factors in the study population."Stroke	REVIEW	"Stroke is now the leading cause of adult disability in the United States. Women are disproportionately affected by stroke. Women increasingly outnumber men in the elderly population, the period of highest risk for stroke. However, there is also a growing recognition that fundamental sex differences are present that contribute to differential ischemic sensitivity. In addition, gonadal hormone exposure can impact coagulation and fibrinolysis, key factors in the initiation of thrombosis. In this review we will discuss sex differences in stroke, with a focus on platelets, vascular reactivity and coagulation. "Stroke	MANAG	"Evaluation of: Gattringer T, Ferrari J, Knoflach M et al. Sex-related differences of acute stroke unit care results from an Austrian stroke unit registry. Stroke 45, 1632-1638 (2014). The authors analyzed data from 47,209 patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack from January 2005 to December 2012. In this study, epidemiological data, stroke type, diagnostics and clinical scores were analyzed for age-adjusted preclinical and clinical characteristics as well as quality of acute stroke care. Moreover, outcome at 3 months was included in a multivariate model corrected for demographic and clinical confounders. While there were no reported sex differences in stroke care and thrombolysis rates, males more often received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. From follow-up data, a worse functional outcome was observed for females in univariate and multivariate analysis. In fact, females were less likely to be prescribed statins and more likely to receive antiplatelet therapy. As a stroke risk factor, a higher rate of atrial fibrillation was observed in females. "Stroke	REVIEW	"Stroke is a major cause of death and disability in adults worldwide. Prevention focused on modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, has shown them to be of significant importance in decreasing the risk of stroke. Multiple studies have brought to light the differences between men and women with regards to stroke and these risk factors. Women have a higher prevalence of stroke, mortality and disability and it has been shown that preventive and treatment options are not as comprehensive for women. Hence, it is of great necessity to evaluate and summarize the differences in gender and stroke risk factors in order to target disparities and optimize prevention, especially because women have a higher lifetime risk of stroke. The purpose of this review is to summarize sex differences in the prevalence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In addition, we will review the sex differences in stroke prevention effectiveness and adherence to blood pressure and cholesterol medications, and suggest future directions for research to reduce the burden of stroke in women. "Stroke	REVIEW	"Cerebral ischemia caused by loss of blood supply to the brain during cardiac arrest or stroke are major causes of death and disability. Biological sex is an important factor in predicting vulnerability of the brain to an ischemic insult, with males being at higher risk for cardio-cerebrovascular events than females of the same age. However, relative incidence of stroke between the genders appears to normalize at advanced ages. Therefore, many scientists have focused on the mechanisms of sex differences in outcome following brain ischemic injury, with a particular emphasis on the role of sex steroids. The majority of studies indicate that female sex steroids, such as estrogen and progesterone, play important roles in the relative neuroprotection following cerebral ischemia observed in females. However, less is known about male sex steroids and brain damage. This review describes the state of our knowledge of androgen-related contributions to neurological injury and recovery following cerebral ischemia that occurs following stroke. Experimental studies examining the effects of castration, androgenic agonists and antagonists and aging provide valuable insights into the role of androgens in clinical outcome following cerebrovascular events. "Stroke	EPI	"Silent brain infarcts (SBIs) are detected by neuroimaging in approximately 20% of elderly patients in population-based studies. Limited evidence is available for hypertensives at low cardiovascular risk countries. Investigating Silent Strokes in Hypertensives: a Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study (ISSYS) is aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of SBIs in a hypertensive Mediterranean population. This is a cohort study in randomly selected hypertensives, aged 50 to 70 years old, and free of clinical stroke and dementia. On baseline, all participants underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging to assess prevalence and location of silent infarcts, and data on vascular risk factors, comorbidities, and the presence of subclinical cardiorenal damage (left ventricular hypertrophy and microalbuminuria) were collected. Multivariate analyses were performed to determine SBIs associated factors. A total of 976 patients (49.4% men, mean age 64 years) were enrolled, and 163 SBIs were detected in 99 participants (prevalence 10.1%; 95% CI, 8.4%-12.2%), most of them (64.4%) located in the basal ganglia and subcortical white matter. After adjustment, besides age and sex, microalbuminuria and increasing total cardiovascular risk (assessed by the Framingham-calibrated for Spanish population risk function) were independently associated with SBIs. Male sex increased the odds of having SBIs in 2.5 as compared with females. Our results highlight the importance of considering both global risk assessment and sex differences in hypertension and may be useful to design future preventive interventions of stroke and dementia. "Stroke	MANAG	"Evidence for gender disparity in response to pharmacological thrombolysis for acute stroke treatment is inconclusive.To compare the effectiveness and safety of alteplase used in the treatment of male and female stroke patients.One thousand and seventy-seven patients who recently had their first-ever clinically apparent stroke (group I: 113 patients treated with intravenous alteplase and group II: 964 not treated with alteplase) were qualified. Groups I and II were divided into subgroups based on gender and were analysed based on: the age when they had a stroke, presence of key stroke risk factors (quantitatively: ‰ä_ or >3), neurological state according to NIHSS in the first day of stroke, mortality rate, and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at day 90 after the stroke. In group I, other determinants were additionally assessed: recent lesions as appeared on CT scans of the head in the first day of stroke and 24 hours after recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), neurological state according to NIHSS in the second day of stroke, and the incidence of iatrogenic bleeding.The age of the onset of stroke was older in women both in group I and group II. Apart from lipid disorders, no statistically significant differences in the distribution of other risk factors for stroke between groups I and II were found. The neurological state (according to the NIHSS scale) on the first day of the disease was significantly more severe in women both in group I and group II. In group II, the level of functioning according to the mRS scale at day 90 day after the onset of the disease was significantly more severe in women; there was no significant difference in group I. Among patients from group I, a significantly greater improvement, according to the NIHSS scale, was found in women 24 hours after rtPA administration in comparison with men. The presence of focal ischemia, responsible for the occurrence of stroke, on the CTs of the head performed 24 hours after rtPA administration, was also significantly more often found in women (in group I). No statistically significant differences in the incidence of complications after rtPA between women and men in group I were observed. In multivariate methods, we did not find any impact of factors other than gender on the outcome after stroke.The use of alteplase in women during the treatment of stroke is associated with a greater and faster improvement in their neurological state in comparison with men. Treating stroke with alteplase in women improves long-term prognosis regarding self-efficacy in everyday functioning. Finally, there are no gender-related differences regarding the safety of intravenous thrombolytic therapy."Stroke	EPI	"Gender difference has been reported in stroke risk factors and disease history. The aim of this study was to compare risk factors and the severity of ischemic stroke based upon modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and hospital mortality between two genders.In a cross-sectional study, 341 patients (44% males and 56% females with a mean age of 68.94 å± 12.74 years) with ischemic stroke, who were hospitalized in the neurology wards of two referral university hospital of North-West Iran (Imam Reza and Razi Hospitals), from the beginning to the end of 2011 were selected and assessed. Gender difference in terms of demographic findings, vascular risk factors, 7(th) day mRS, and hospital mortality (during admission) were evaluated.In 2.6% of cases, mRS was found to be less than 2 (favorable) and in 97.4% of cases; mRS was 2-5 (with disability). No significant difference in ischemic stroke severity based on mRS was observed between two genders. There was a significant difference in the rate of hypertension (females = 72.3%, males = 59.3%, P = 0.010), diabetes (females = 28.8%, males = 18.7%, P = 0.030), smoking (females = 6.3%, males = 35.3%, P < 0.001). No significant difference was seen in other risk factors between two genders. There was no significant difference in the mortality rate, which constituted 8.9% and 4.7% in females and males respectively (P = 0.140).The evidence from the present study suggests that despite the existence of some difference between risk-factors in two genders, there was no difference in terms of ischemic stroke severity and mortality rate between two genders."Stroke	REVIEW	"Although typically associated with maintenance of female reproductive function, estrogens mediate physiological processes in nearly every body tissue, including the central nervous system. Numerous pre-clinical studies have shown that estrogen, specifically 17-beta-estradiol (17ë_-E2), protects the brain from ischemic injury following stroke. There are multiple mechanisms of 17ë_-E2's neuroprotection, including activation of several neuroprotective pathways in the brain, but 17ë_-E2 also mediates the local and systemic immune response to ischemic stroke. This review summarizes the immune response to stroke, sex differences in stroke pathophysiology, and the role of estrogen as an immunomodulator. This review will focus almost entirely on the role of 17ë_-E2; however, there will be a brief review and comparison to other forms of estrogen. Understanding the immunomodulatory action of estrogens may provide an opportunity for the use of estrogens in treatment of stroke and other inflammatory disease. "Stroke	EPI	"Previous studies of patients with ""lone"" and ""idiopathic"" atrial fibrillation (AF) have provided conflicting evidence concerning the development, management and prognosis of this condition.In this nation-wide, retrospective, cohort study, we studied patients diagnosed with incidental AF recorded in national Swedish registries between 1995 and 2008. Controls were matched for age, sex and calendar year of the diagnosis of AF in patients. All subjects were free of any in-hospital diagnosis from 1987 and until patients were diagnosed with AF and also free of any diagnosis within one year from the time of inclusion. Follow-up continued until 2009. We identified 9519 patients (31% women) and 12,468 matched controls.Relative risks (RR) versus controls for stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in women were 19.6, 4.4, 3.4 and 2.5 in the age categories <55, 55-64, 65-74 and 75-85, years respectively. Corresponding figures for men were 3.4, 2.5, 1.7 and 1.9. RR for heart failure were 6.6, 6.6, 6.3 and 3.8 in women and 7.8, 4.6, 4.9 and 2.9 in men. All RR were statistically significant with p < 0.01. RR for myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality were statistically significantly increased only in the two oldest age categories in women and 65-74 years in men.Patients with AF and no co-morbidities at inclusion had at least a doubled risk of stroke or TIA and a tripled risk of heart failure, through all age categories, as compared to controls. Women were at higher RR of stroke or TIA than men."Stroke	PP	"There are important sex differences in the risk and outcome of conditions and diseases between males and females. For example, stroke occurs with greater frequency in men than in women across diverse ethnic backgrounds and nationalities. Work from our lab and others have revealed a sex-specific sensitivity to cerebral ischemia whereby males exhibit a larger extent of brain damage following an ischemic event compared to females. Studies suggest that the difference in male and female susceptibility to ischemia may be triggered by innate variations in gene regulation and protein expression between the sexes that are independent of post-natal exposure to sex hormones. We have shown that there are differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression in adult male and female brain following focal cerebral ischemia in mouse cortex. Herein we examine a role for differential expression of miRNAs during development in male and female rat cortex as potential effectors of the phenotype that leads to sex differences to ischemia. Expression studies in male and female cortices isolated from postnatal day 0 (P0), postnatal day 7 (P7), and adult rats using TaqMan Low Density miRNA arrays and NanoString nCounter analysis revealed differential miRNA levels between males and females at each developmental stage. We focused on the miR-200 family of miRNAs that showed higher levels in females at P0, but higher levels in males at P7 that persisted into adulthood, and validated the expression of miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-429 by individual qRT-PCR as these are clustered on chromosome 5 and may be transcriptionally co-regulated. Prediction analysis of the miR-200 miRNAs revealed that genes within the Gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor pathway are the most heavily targeted. These studies support that developmental changes in miRNA expression may influence phenotypes in adult brain that underlie sexually dimorphic responses to disease, including ischemia. "Stroke	EPI	"Sarcopenia, the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, develops with aging and may be a pivotal risk factor in individual cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We examined whether sarcopenia was positively associated with the prevalence of CVDs, including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and stroke, in adults of each gender aged ‰ä´50 years, independent of other covariates and possible confounders.This cross-sectional study included 3,009 men and 4,199 women aged ‰ä´550 years who participated in the 2008-2010 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Sarcopenia was defined as appendicular skeletal muscle mass/body weight <1 (moderate) or 2 (severe) standard deviations below gender-specific means for young adults. CVD prevalence was positively associated with sarcopenia in men after adjusting for confounders involved in CVD risk factors (Class I, OR=1.847 and Class II, OR=2.347; P<0.05). However, no such association was found in women. Furthermore, for individual CVDs, a strong positive association between stroke and sarcopenia (Class I, OR=1.734 and Class II, OR=3.725; P<0.05) and a moderate association between angina pectoris and sarcopenia (Class I, OR=1.988 and Class II, OR=1.347; P<0.05) were observed in men only. Interestingly, only the estimated homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance was greater in men with moderate and severe sarcopenia than in those with normal states, whereas only serum total cholesterol levels were significantly higher in women with severe sarcopenia than in those with normal states. In both genders, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly lower in moderate and severe sarcopenic states.men aged ‰ä´50 years with sarcopenia showed elevated prevalence of CVDs, especially stroke, in a representative sample of the general South Korean population."Stroke	EPI	"Sex differences in macrovascular disease, especially in stroke, are observed across studies of epidemiology. We studied a large sample of patients with type 2 diabetes to better understand the relationship between glycaemic control and stroke risk.We prospectively investigated the sex-specific association between different levels of HbA(1c) and incident stroke risk among 10,876 male and 19,278 female patients with type 2 diabetes.During a mean follow-up of 6.7 years, 2,949 incident cases of stroke were identified. The multivariable-adjusted HRs of stroke associated with different levels of HbA(1c) at baseline (HbA(1c) <6.0% [<42 mmol/mol], 6.0-6.9% [42-52 mmol/mol] [reference group], 7.0-7.9% [53-63 mmol/mol], 8.0-8.9% [64-74 mmol/mol], 9.0-9.9% [75-85 mmol/mol] and ‰ä´10.0% [‰ä´86 mmol/mol]) were 0.96 (95% CI 0.80, 1.14), 1.00, 1.04 (0.85, 1.28), 1.11 (0.89, 1.39), 1.10 (0.86, 1.41) and 1.22 (0.92, 1.35) (p for trend‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.66) for men, and 1.03 (0.90, 1.18), 1.00, 1.09 (0.94, 1.26), 1.19 (1.00, 1.42), 1.32 (1.09, 1.59) and 1.42 (1.23, 1.65) (p for trend <0.001) for women, respectively. The graded association between HbA(1c) during follow-up and stroke risk was observed among women (p for trend‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.066). When stratified by race, whether with or without glucose-lowering agents, this graded association of HbA(1c) with stroke was still present among women. When stratified by age, the adjusted HRs were significantly higher in women older than 55 years compared with younger women.The current study suggests a graded association between HbA1c and the risk of stroke among women with type 2 diabetes. Poor control of blood sugar has a stronger effect in diabetic women older than 55 years."Stroke	REVIEW	"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an independent risk factor for thromboembolism and stroke. Women with AF are at a higher overall risk for thromboembolic stroke when compared to men with AF. Recent evidence suggests that female sex, after adjusting for stroke risk profile and sex differences in utilisation of anticoagulation, is an independent stroke risk factor in AF. The inclusion of female sex has improved the accuracy of the CHADS2 stroke risk stratification schema (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age 75 years or greater, Diabetes mellitus, and prior Stroke or TIA). The newly revised and validated schema, CHA2DS2-VASc, dichotomises age and incorporates female sex and vascular disease history. The pathophysiological mechanisms to explain this increased risk in women are not well understood. According to Virchow's triad, thrombosis that leads to stroke in AF should arise from three co-existing phenomena: structural abnormalities, blood stasis, and a hypercoagulable state. Herein, we explore the sex differences in the biological processes that lead to thrombus formation as applied to Virchow's Triad. The objective of this review is to describe the potential mechanisms behind the increased risk of stroke in AF associated with female sex. "Stroke	OUTC	"We aimed to compare quality of life (QOL) in women and men after ischemic stroke or TIA, and to determine the incremental impact of demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and stroke-specific effects on longitudinal QOL.We assessed QOL in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA at 3 and 12 months postdischarge in the Adherence eValuation After Ischemic stroke-Longitudinal Registry using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) instrument. We generated multivariable linear regression models to evaluate the association between sex and EQ-5D while sequentially adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, and stroke-related variables. We also used a proportional odds model to assess sex differences in the change in EQ-5D scores from 3 to 12 months.A total of 1,370 patients were included, 53.7% male, median age 65 years (interquartile range 56-77 years). Women had significantly lower QOL at 3 months (unadjusted EQ-5D 0.81 in women vs 0.84 in men; p < 0.001) and 12 months (0.83 vs men 0.84; p < 0.001) poststroke. After multivariable adjustment for sociodemographic, clinical, and stroke-related factors, women continued to have lower QOL at 3 months (mean difference -0.036; p = 0.003) and at 12 months (mean difference -0.022; p = 0.046). Women fared worse in the dimensions of mobility, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression at 3 and 12 months. There were no sex differences in change in EQ-5D score from 3 to 12 months.Women have worse QOL than men up to 12 months after stroke, even after adjusting for important sociodemographic variables, stroke severity, and disability."Stroke	OUTC	"To describe sleep experiences after stroke using subjective and objective indicators and identify possible gender differences in sleep in the acute phase and at 6-month follow-up.Sleep disturbances after stoke are recognized, but poorly described. Gender differences in sleep exist in other populations, but have not been reported after stroke.A longitudinal cohort study.Subjective sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and objective sleep was estimated with actigraphy in 100 patients in the acute phase and six months after stroke, from April 2007-March 2009.Subjective sleep quality was better and objective wake percentage was lower at follow-up than in the acute phase after stroke. Actigraphy estimated low sleep efficiency and many awakenings at both time points. Subjective and objective measures were correlated at the 6-month follow-up, but not in the acute phase. Women's subjective sleep efficiency and total score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were worse than men's in the acute phase, but actigraphy estimated that women slept more than men in the course of a day. Women's subjective sleep quality was better at follow-up than in the acute phase. Men reported worse subjective sleep quality, but better subjective sleep efficiency at follow-up than in the acute phase, and also had lower objective wake percentage at follow-up.Subjective sleep quality was poor and actigraphy indicated disturbed sleep-wake patterns in the acute phase and at 6-month follow-up. Gender differences existed in subjective and objective sleep in the acute phase, but not at follow-up."Stroke	PP	"Experimental studies indicate that estrogen typically, but not universally, has a neuroprotective effect in stroke. Ischemic stroke increases membrane-bound G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) distribution and expression in the brain of male but not female mice. We hypothesized that GPER activation may have a greater neuroprotective effect in males than in females after stroke.Vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide), a GPER agonist (G-1, 30 ë_g/kg), or a GPER antagonist (G-15, 300 ë_g/kg) were administered alone or in combination to young or aged male mice, or young intact or ovariectomized female mice, 1 hour before or 3 hours after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Some mice were treated with a combination of G-1 and the pan-caspase inhibitor, quinoline-Val-Asp(Ome)-CH2-O-phenoxy (Q-VD-OPh), 1 hour before stroke. We evaluated functional and histological end points of stroke outcome up to 72 hours after ischemia-reperfusion. In addition, apoptosis was examined using cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemistry.Surprisingly, G-1 worsened functional outcomes and increased infarct volume in males poststroke, in association with an increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 in peri-infarct neurons. These effects were blocked by G-15 or Q-VD-OPh. Conversely, G-15 improved functional outcomes and reduced infarct volume after stroke in males, whether given before or after stroke. In contrast to findings in males, G-1 reduced neurological deficit, apoptosis, and infarct volume in ovariectomized females, but had no significant effect in intact females.Future therapies for acute stroke could exploit the modulation of GPER activity in a sex-specific manner."Stroke	REVIEW	"Diabetes mellitus is a major cause of death and disability worldwide and is a strong risk factor for stroke. Whether and to what extent the excess risk of stroke conferred by diabetes differs between the sexes is unknown. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the relative effect of diabetes on stroke risk in women compared with men.We systematically searched PubMed for reports of prospective, population-based cohort studies published between Jan 1, 1966, and Dec 16, 2013. Studies were selected if they reported sex-specific estimates of the relative risk (RR) for stroke associated with diabetes, and its associated variability. We pooled the sex-specific RRs and their ratio comparing women with men using random-effects meta-analysis with inverse-variance weighting.Data from 64 cohort studies, representing 775,385 individuals and 12,539 fatal and non-fatal strokes, were included in the analysis. The pooled maximum-adjusted RR of stroke associated with diabetes was 2åá28 (95% CI 1åá93-2åá69) in women and 1åá83 (1åá60-2åá08) in men. Compared with men with diabetes, women with diabetes therefore had a greater risk of stroke--the pooled ratio of RRs was 1åá27 (1åá10-1åá46; I(2)=0%), with no evidence of publication bias. This sex differential was seen consistently across major predefined stroke, participant, and study subtypes.The excess risk of stroke associated with diabetes is significantly higher in women than men, independent of sex differences in other major cardiovascular risk factors. These data add to the existing evidence that men and women experience diabetes-related diseases differently and suggest the need for further work to clarify the biological, behavioural, or social mechanisms involved.None."Stroke	OUTC	"Inconsistent results have been reported for the impact of sex on stroke outcomes. We investigated the differences in health-related quality of life between adult male and female stroke survivors in Northeastern China. Information on background variables was collected during hospital stay. Follow-up data were obtained through a phone interview 6 months after discharge, which included the Barthel Index and a 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) reflecting overall health status. The independent effects of sex on activities of daily living independence (Barthel Index ‰©_ 95) were analyzed. Our results showed that female stroke patients were older than male stroke patients and were more likely to have transient ischemic attack and hypertension. Male stroke patients were more likely to have a history of smoking, heart disease and dyslipidemia, while female patients were less likely to achieve daily living independence. The mean scores of physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health in the SF-36 survey were significantly higher in men than woman. Regression analyses confirmed that female sex was adversely associated with overall health status at discharge. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that there were sex differences in stroke recovery and quality of life among Chinese stroke survivors at 6 months post-discharge, with an overall worse stroke outcome for female stroke survivors."Stroke	EPI	"There are few studies analyzing features of ischemic stroke subtypes in women. We assessed gender differences in lacunar stroke subtype based on data collected from a prospective stroke registry in Barcelona, Spain. Lacunar ischemic stroke was diagnosed in 310 (8.1 %) women and 423 (11.1 %) men of a total of 3,808 consecutive stroke patients included in a prospective hospital-based stroke registry, in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain), over a period of 19 years. Independent factors for lacunar stroke in women were assessed by multivariate analysis. Women accounted for 42 % of all lacunar stroke patients (n = 733) in the registry and 11.4 % of all patients with ischemic stroke (n = 2,704). Very old age (85 years or older) was found in 20.3 % in women versus 11.1 % in men (P < 0.0001). In the logistic regression analysis, obesity [odds ratio (OR) = 4.24], prolonged hospital stay (>12 days) (OR = 1.59), arterial hypertension (OR = 1.50), and age (OR = 1.06) were significant variables independently associated with lacunar stoke in women, whereas peripheral vascular disease (OR = 0.51), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 0.46), renal dysfunction (OR = 0.13), and heavy smoking (OR = 0.04) were independent variables for lacunar stroke in men. Women with lacunar stroke were remarkably older and presented with obesity and hypertension more frequently than did men. Lacunar stroke severity was similar in men and women. These findings in lacunar stroke patients could be explained by differences in gender for ischemic stroke in general."Stroke	EPI	"Sex differences in secular trends of stroke incidence are rarely reported. We aimed to explore sex differences in incidence and mortality of stroke in rural China from 1992 to 2012.In 1992, 14 920 residents were recruited to participate in the Tianjin Brain Study, a population-based study on stroke surveillance. Stroke events and all deaths were annually registered.We observed 908 incident strokes (366 in women) from 1992 to 2012. Women were significantly younger than men (64å±12 versus 68å±11 years) in 1992 to 1998 (P=0.024). The incidence of first-ever stroke per 100 000 person-years for men was 166 in 1992 to 1998, 227 in 1999 to 2005, and 376 in 2006 to 2012; for women, the rates were 86 (1992-1998), 148 (1999-2005), and 264 (2006-2012). From 1992 to 2012, the incidence grew annually by 5.8% in men and 8.0% in women. The male/female incidence ratio declined significantly: 1.9 in 1992 to 1998, 1.5 in 1999 to 2005, and 1.4 in 2006 to 2012. There were no significant sex differences in mortality. The prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus, the levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides, and the age of menopause and reproductive years in women concurrently increased in 2011.There was a significant increase in the incidence of first-ever stroke in women annually and a declining trend in the male/female rate ratio in rural China during the past 21 years. These results suggest that stroke will become one of the major diseases affecting women in future decades in China."Stroke	MANAG	"Sex-related differences in quality of acute stroke care are an important concern with limited data available, specifically regarding stroke unit (SU) setting. We used the prospective nationwide Austrian SU registry to address this issue.Our analysis covered an 8-year time period (January 2005 to December 2012) during which all patients with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke admitted to 1 of 35 Austrian SU had been captured in the registry. These data were analyzed for age-adjusted preclinical and clinical characteristics and quality of acute stroke care in men and women. In addition, we assessed the outcome at 3 months in multivariate analysis.A total of 47 209 individuals (47% women) had received SU care. Women were significantly older (median age: 77.9 versus 70.3 years), had higher pre-existing disability and more severe strokes. Correcting for age, no significant sex-related differences in quality of care were identified with comparable onset-to-door times, times to and rates of neuroimaging, as well as door-to-needle times and rates of intravenous thrombolysis (14.5% for both sexes). Despite equal acute stroke care and a comparable rate of neurorehabilitation, women had a worse functional outcome at 3-month follow-up (modified Rankin scale 3-5: odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval [1.17-1.36]), but a lower mortality (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [0.78-0.88]) after correcting for confounders.We identified no disproportions in quality of care in the acute SU setting between men and women, but the outcome was significantly different. Further studies on the poststroke period including socioeconomic aspects are needed to clarify this finding."Stroke	OUTC	"OBJECTIVE To analyze gender differences in the incidence and determinants of disability regarding instrumental activities of daily living among older adults. METHODS The data were extracted from the SaÌ¼de, Bem-Estar e Envelhecimento (SABE - Health, Wellbeing and Ageing) study. In 2000, 1,034 older adults without difficulty in regarding instrumental activities of daily living were selected. The following characteristics were evaluated at the baseline: sociodemographic and behavioral variables, health status, falls, fractures, hospitalizations, depressive symptoms, cognition, strength, mobility, balance and perception of vision and hearing. Instrumental activities of daily living such as shopping and managing own money and medication, using transportation and using the telephone were reassessed in 2006, with incident cases of disability considered as the outcome. RESULTS The incidence density of disability in instrumental activities of daily living was 44.7/1,000 person/years for women and 25.2/1,000 person/years for men. The incidence rate ratio between women and men was 1.77 (95%CI 1.75;1.80). After controlling for socioeconomic status and clinical conditions, the incidence rate ratio was 1.81 (95%CI 1.77;1.84), demonstrating that women with chronic disease and greater social vulnerability have a greater incidence density of disability in instrumental activities of daily living. The following were determinants of the incidence of disability: age ‰ä´ 80 and worse perception of hearing in both genders; stroke in men; and being aged 70 to 79 in women. Better cognitive performance was a protective factor in both genders and better balance was a protective factor in women. CONCLUSIONS The higher incidence density of disability in older women remained even after controlling for adverse social and clinical conditions. In addition to age, poorer cognitive performance and conditions that adversely affect communication disable both genders. Acute events, such as a stroke, disables elderly men more, whereas early deficits regarding balance disable women more. "Stroke	MANAG	"The main objective of the present analysis was to assess the effect of treatment with aspirin compared with apixaban on ischemic stroke and major bleeding in women compared with men. Female patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased stroke risk compared with male patients, and the underlying reasons for higher risk are uncertain.Ancillary analysis of the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid [ASA] to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) trial, comparing aspirin and apixaban, focused on sex differences. Mean follow-up was 1.1 years.Women compared with men tended to be older (aspirin, 71.8 versus 68.8 years; apixaban, 71.4 versus 68.6 years), with a higher proportion of those aged‰ä´75 years. Also, women had less peripheral artery disease (aspirin, 2.4% versus 3.7%; apixaban, 1.4% versus 3.0%), more heart failure, and higher mean CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age of 75 years or older, diabetes [1 point each], stroke or transient ischemic attack [2 points]) scores (aspirin, 2.2 versus 2.0; apixaban, 2.1 versus 2.0). Women compared with men had higher ischemic stroke rates (aspirin, 3.99% versus 2.28%; apixaban, 1.55% versus 0.82%) but similar bleeding rates (aspirin, 1.29% versus 1.22%; apixaban, 1.15% versus 1.36%). The relative effect of apixaban compared with aspirin was similar in men and women for both ischemic stroke (women, 3.99% versus 1.55%; hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.64; men, 2.28% versus 0.82%; hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.63; Pint=0.84) and major bleeding (women, 1.29% versus 1.15%; hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-2.23; men, 1.36% versus 1.22%; hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-2.02; Pint=0.96).Female patients with atrial fibrillation had higher ischemic stroke rates compared with male patients, but the relative effects of apixaban compared with aspirin on both ischemic stroke and bleeding were similar in men and women."Stroke	OUTC	"Several studies have examined gender differences in various stroke outcomes. There is however little information on the influence of gender on post-stroke functioning in the context of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).Gender differences in selected components of functioning, namely motor performance (body function), activity and participation, were examined in a sample of Nigerian stroke survivors.This longitudinal study involved consenting first-incidence stroke survivors who were consecutively recruited from in-patient wards of a University teaching hospital in northern Nigeria. Demographic and clinical data were obtained at recruitment while motor performance, activity and participation were assessed at the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th months using the Simplified Fugl Meyer scale, the Functional Independence Measure Motor Sub-scale and the London Handicap Scale respectively.Participants were thirty-three male (60%) and 22 female (40%) stroke survivors who did not significantly differ in age, stroke sub-type, laterality and initial severity (P > 0.05). There were also no significant differences in motor performance, activity and participation between the male and female stroke survivors across the time points.Gender differences were not observed in the components of functioning over the first 12 months post-stroke."Stroke	EPI	"Sex-based differences in outcomes for the treatment of carotid arterial disease remains a controversial topic. The main objective of this study was to determine if gender differences influence 30-day stroke and mortality rates after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in a large series of patients.This is a retrospective study of all patients undergoing endarterectomy performed by a single surgeon between January 1, 1993 and December 15, 2010. The analysis included data from 1,046 CEAs (683 men and 363 women).There were no differences found in 30-day stroke, death, or combined stroke and death rates between women and men. The 30-day stroke rate was 1.6% for women and 1.8% for men (P = 0.98), with no significant differences between asymptomatic patients (1.7% for women vs. 1.2% for men; P = 0.70) or symptomatic patients (1.6% for women vs. 2.1% for men; P = 0.74). The 30-day mortality rate was 0.8% for women and 0.9% for men (P = 0.85) with no significant differences between asymptomatic patients (0.8% for women vs. 1.2% for men; P = 0.77) and symptomatic patients (0.8% for women vs. 0.7% for men; PåÊ= 0.84). There was a similar low risk for the combined outcome of stroke and death (1.9% for women vs. 2.2% for men; P = 0.92), with no differences between asymptomatic patients (1.7% for women vs. 1.6% for men; P = 0.89) or symptomatic patients (2.1% for women vs. 2.5% for men; P = 0.84).Female sex does not influence 30-day stroke and mortality rates after CEA, regardless of preoperative symptom status."Stroke	REVIEW	"Studies comparing gender-specific outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have reported conflicting results. Gender differences in cerebrovascular accident/systemic embolism (CVA/SE) or major bleeding outcomes with novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) use are not known. The goal of this analysis was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating gender differences in residual risk of CVA/SE and major bleeding outcomes in patients with nonvalvular AF treated with either warfarin or NOAC. Sixty-four randomized studies were identified using keywords ""gender,"" ""AF,"" and ""CVA."" Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-analysis method, 6 studies met criteria for inclusion in this meta-analysis. CVA/SE and major bleeding outcomes were separately analyzed in cohorts receiving warfarin and NOAC agents, comparing men with women. Women with AF taking warfarin were at a significantly greater residual risk of CVA/SE compared with men (odds ratio 1.279, 95% confidence interval 1.111 to 1.473, Z = -3.428, p = 0.001). No gender difference in residual risk of CVA/SE was noted in patients with AF receiving NOAC agents (odds ratio 1.146, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.354, p = 0.109). Major bleeding was less frequent in women with AF treated with NOAC. In conclusion, women with AF treated with warfarin have a greater residual risk of CVA/SE and an equivalent major bleeding risk, whereas those treated with NOAC agents deemed superior to warfarin are at equivalent residual risk of CVA/SE and less major bleeding risk compared with men. These results suggest an increased net clinical benefit of NOAC agents compared with warfarin in treating women with AF."Stroke	MANAG	"Studies suggest that gender differences exist in the recognition of stroke warning signs. Poor recognition of stroke warning signs has been attributed to negative treatment-seeking behaviors, which can result in poor outcomes.The aim of this study was to examine gender differences in the recognition of traditional early warning signs of stroke and first action to initiate treatment in a sample of stroke survivors.We collected survey data to examine recognition of traditional stroke warning signs and appropriate first action to initiate treatment along with demographic (age, stroke age, education, usual source of care, and insurance) and clinical (health literacy and stroke knowledge) variables.Seventy-one stroke survivors participated in this pilot study. Women in the sample were significantly older than men at time of stroke (62 years old vs. 55 years old; p < .05). The two groups did not differ in clinical variables. Recognition of traditional individual stroke warning signs ranged from approximately 60% to 90%. There were no significant gender differences in the recognition of individual warning signs. Women were more likely to recognize all five traditional warning signs compared with men (67% vs. 42%; p = .04). Similarly, 58% of female participants recognized all five traditional stroke warning signs collectively and would call 9-1-1 as a first action compared with only 29% of men (p = .02).Although women recognized traditional stroke warning signs more often than men, educational programs should emphasize both traditional and nontraditional stroke warning signs among women and address these differences with their healthcare providers."Stroke	REVIEW	"Cardiovascular diseases actually remain the leading cause of death and morbidity in Western countries, and it is the most common cause of death in American women accounting for about one third of all deaths. Women remain underrepresented in published trial literature relative to their disease prevalence. Strong evidence do exists demonstrating gender differences in efficacy (ischemic risk) and safety (bleeding risk) associated with antithrombotic treatment, mostly related to different values of body mass, and renal function in women than men. Several data show a higher platelet reactivity in females and a higher prevalence of high platelet reactivity on aspirin and clopidogrel therapy. In primary prevention, the use of aspirin is associated with a higher reduction of risk for ischemic stroke in females and for myocardial infarction in males. In the setting of ACS, female gender is associated with a significantly higher risk of bleeding. In summary, there are some gender-related aspects of guidance in the complex spectrum of the net clinical benefit related to antithrombotic treatment. "Stroke	EPI	"We assessed gender differences and women-specific secular trends in stroke.Data from 2318 women and 2274 men with first-ever stroke collected from the Sagrat Cor Hospital Stroke Registry of Barcelona between 1986 and 2009 were analyzed.Patient's age increased significantly from a mean of 74.5 years in 1986-1992 to 81.2 years in 2004-2009 (P < 0.001). Patients aged ‰ä´ 85 years increased from 18.5% to 38.5% (P = 0.0001) as were patients with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cardioembolic stroke. The in-hospital death decreased from 17.6% to 11% (P = 0.02), median length of hospital from 14 to 9 days (P = 0.0001) and prolonged hospital stay (> 12 days) from 59.7% to 33.7% (P = 0.0001). Lacunar infarction was more frequent in men (21.5% vs. 16.2%, P = 0.0003) and cardioembolic infarction in women (26% vs. 15.6%, P = 0.0001). Acute stroke in women continues to be a severe disease with high risk of death in the immediate post-stroke phase (13.5%) and low probability of early full neurological recovery (13.9% vs. 11.8%, P = 0.029).Women differ from men in the distribution of risk factors and stroke subtype, stroke severity, and outcome. An increase in the patient's age, hypertension, atrial fibrillation and cardioembolic infarction, as well as a decrease mortality and length of hospitalization over a 24-year period was recorded."Stroke	REVIEW	"Cerebrovascular neurologic emergencies including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and migraine are leading causes of death and disability that are frequently diagnosed and treated in the emergency department (ED). Although sex and gender differences in neurologic emergencies are beginning to become clearer, there are many unanswered questions about how emergency physicians should incorporate sex and gender into their research initiatives, patient evaluations, and overall management plans for these conditions. After evaluating the existing gaps in the literature, a core group of ED researchers developed a draft of future research priorities. Participants in the 2014 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference neurologic emergencies working group then discussed and approved the recommended research agenda using a standardized nominal group technique. Recommendations for future research on the role of sex and gender in the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes pertinent to ED providers are described for each of three diagnoses: stroke, SAH, and migraine. Recommended future research also includes investigation of the biologic and pathophysiologic differences between men and women with neurologic emergencies as they pertain to ED diagnoses and treatments. "Stroke	REVIEW	"Asian countries are in various stages of epidemiological transition and therefore exhibit a great diversity in disease patterns. Collectively, they comprise almost two-third of the world's total mortality due to stroke. The purpose of this review is to explore existing epidemiological data on stroke, highlight the temporal trends in stroke epidemiology in various regions of Asia and predict future patterns based on these observations. Our search revealed that there is a lack of good epidemiological data from most Asian countries. Whatever data exist are not comparable due to lack of standardised methodology for ascertaining stroke and its subtypes. For this and other reasons, these estimates exhibit country-to-country variation and also within-country variability. We have also reviewed temporal trends in stroke incidence and prevalence in 12 Asian countries and the evolution of stroke subtypes over the past two decades. Important observations include a rise in stroke incidence in most Asian countries, an earlier age at onset compared with the West, a relative increase in the proportion of ischaemic strokes and a decline in haemorrhagic strokes. Among ischaemic stroke subtypes, lacunar strokes, which were once the commonest variety, are now declining. Emerging data suggest that large artery atherosclerosis and in particular that of intracranial vessels is the predominant aetiology in most Asian countries. The review also identified important gender differences in terms of stroke risk factors, prevalence and outcomes. There is need for sound epidemiological data from most countries to understand the disease better and plan policy-level interventions to decrease the burden. We identify a need for standard format or guidelines for conducting stroke epidemiological studies especially in developing Asian countries. This region must be identified as a priority region for stroke-related interventions and preventive strategies by global healthcare authorities and organisations. "Stroke	REVIEW	"Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke, but this risk is not homogenous. Many risk factors contribute to stroke risk however, the evidence for female sex as a risk factor is less well-established.To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available evidence to establish if female sex is a risk factor for stroke/thromboembolism among patients with AF.A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline. The search term 'atrial fibrillation' was used in combination with 'stroke risk', 'thromboembolism', 'female' and 'gender differences' and returned 735 articles, of which 17 were appraised and included. Females with AF were compared with males with AF for the outcome of stroke/thromboembolism.Seventeen studies, 5 randomized-controlled trials and 12 prospective observational studies were included; 10 demonstrated an increased risk of stroke in women. Meta-analysis of the 17 studies revealed a 1.31-fold (95% confidence intervals (CIs) 1.18-1.46) elevated risk of stroke in women with AF; the risk appearing greatest for women aged ‰ä´75 years. Only three studies compared entirely anticoagulated populations; stroke rates among these patients varied from 1.2-1.44% per-patient year for men and 2.08-2.43% per-patient year for women. Risk of stroke in women appeared similar regardless of oral anticoagulation therapy [risk ratio (95% CI 1.29 (1.09-1.52) and 1.49 (1.17-1.90) in non-anticogulated vs. anticoagulated/mixed cohorts, respectively).Women with AF are at increased risk of stroke, particularly elderly women. Comprehensive stroke risk assessment, including sex as a risk factor, should be undertaken in all AF patients."Stroke	PP	"Two hundred ischemic stroke patients and 193 age and sex matched healthy controls were studied for the presence of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Insertion/Deletion (ACE I/D) gene polymorphism. The PCR studies revealed that ACE 'II' (ORåÊ=åÊ2.055; påÊ=åÊ0.004) genotype and 'I' (ORåÊ=åÊ1.411; påÊ=åÊ0.018) alleles were significantly associated with IS patients. Gender specific analysis revealed a strong association of 'II' (ORåÊ=åÊ2.044; påÊ=åÊ0.014) genotype and 'I' (ORåÊ=åÊ1.531; påÊ=åÊ0.011) allele with male sex. Classification of patients based on TOAST criteria, revealed a significant association for 'II' genotype (ORåÊ=åÊ1.713; påÊ=åÊ0.043) and 'I' (ORåÊ=åÊ1.382; påÊ=åÊ0.039) allele in LVD patients only. When the data was stratified based on age and sex, a statistically significant association was observed for ACE 'II' genotype (ORåÊ=åÊ2.288; påÊ=åÊ0.006) and 'I' allele (ORåÊ=åÊ1.395; påÊ=åÊ0.054) in IS male patients of >åÊ50åÊyears of age. The ACE 'D' allele was found to be increased in controls (ORåÊ=åÊ0.709; påÊ=åÊ0.018) than IS patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that smoking and diabetes were the most powerful independent risk factor in LVD type of stroke. Thus, we presented here an evidence for a strong association of ACE 'II' genotype and 'I' allele compounded by factors such as smoking and diabetes among south Indian IS patients. "Stroke	EPI	"Although ethnic or cultural differences affect prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, limited information is available about the age- and gender-stratified prevalence of the risk factors in Asian stroke population.We assessed gender- and age-stratified prevalences of major risk factors in Korean stroke patients, and assumed that the gender differences are attenuated by adjustment with lifestyle factors.Using the nationwide hospital-based stroke registry, we identified 9417 ischemic stroke patients admitted between April 2008 and January 2011. Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, prior stroke, and coronary heart disease was assessed in both genders by age groups. We analyzed gender differences of the prevalence among the age groups by calculating prevalence ratio, and further explored the influence of lifestyle factors on the gender difference in multivariable analyses.Hypertension and hyperlipidemia were more common in men until middle age, but after that more common in women, whereas diabetes was more common in women after 65 years of age. Atrial fibrillation increased steadily with age in both genders but was more common in women through all age groups. Prior stroke and coronary heart disease showed inconsistent gender differences. Gender differences in hypertension and diabetes among the age groups were attenuated by adjustment with accompanying risk factors including lifestyle factors.Korean women with stroke had more hypertension and hyperlipidemia after middle age, more diabetes after 65 years, and more atrial fibrillation throughout all ages. Strategies to control risk factors in women at risk for stroke are eagerly needed."Stroke	PP	"Stroke risk and outcome are strongly modified by estrogen. In addition to ovaries, estrogen is produced locally in peripheral tissue by the enzyme aromatase, and extragonadal synthesis becomes the major source of estrogen after menopause. Aromatase gene deletion in female mice exacerbates ischemic brain damage after stroke. However, it is not clear which cell type is responsible for this effect, since aromatase is expressed in multiple cell types, including cerebrovascular endothelium. We tested the hypothesis that cerebrovascular aromatase contributes to sex differences in cerebrovascular endothelial function. Cerebrocortical microvascular responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator ACh were compared between male and female wild-type (WT) and aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice by measuring laser-Doppler perfusion in vivo through a closed cranial window. Additional studies were performed in WT mice treated with the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole or vehicle. WT female mice had significantly greater responses to ACh compared with WT males (P < 0.001), which was associated with higher aromatase expression in female compared with male cerebral vessels (P < 0.05). ACh responses were significantly lower in ArKO compared with WT females (P < 0.05) and in WT females treated with fadrozole versus vehicle (P < 0.001). Conversely, ACh responses were significantly higher in ArKO versus WT males (P < 0.05). Levels of phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were lower in ArKO versus WT female brains, but were not altered by aromatase deletion in males. We conclude that cerebrovascular endothelial aromatase plays an important and sexually dimorphic role in cerebrovascular function and that aromatase inhibitors in clinical use may have cardiovascular consequences in both males and females. "Stroke	MANAG	"Previous research has indicated that women and blacks have worse outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Little research has been done to investigate the combined influence of race and gender in the presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with AIS. We sought to determine the association of race and gender on initial stroke severity, thrombolysis, and functional outcome after AIS.AIS patients who presented to 2 academic medical centers in the United States (2004-2011) were identified through prospective registries. In-hospital strokes were excluded. Stroke severity, measured by admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), neurologic deterioration (defined by a ‰ä´2-point increase in NIHSS score), and functional outcome at discharge, measured by the modified Rankin Scale, were investigated. These outcomes were compared across race/gender groups. A subanalysis was conducted to assess race/gender differences in exclusion criteria for tPA.Of the 4925 patients included in this study, 2346 (47.6%) were women and 2310 (46.9%) were black. White women had the highest median NIHSS score on admission (8), whereas white men had the lowest median NIHSS score on admission (6). There were no differences in outcomes between black men and white men. A smaller percentage of black women than white women were treated with tPA (27.6% versus 36.6%, P < .0001), partially because of a greater proportion of white women presenting within 3 hours (51% versus 45.5%, P = .0005). Black women had decreased odds of poor functional outcome relative to white women (odds ratio [OR] = .85, 95% confidence interval [CI] .72-1.00), but after adjustment for baseline differences in age, NIHSS, and tPA use, this association was no longer significant (OR = 1.2, 95% CI .92-1.46, P = .22). Black women with an NIHSS score less than 7 on admission were at lower odds of receiving tPA than the other race/gender groups, even after adjusting for arriving within 3 hours and admission glucose (OR = .66, 95% CI .44-.99, P = .0433).Race and gender were not significantly associated with short-term outcome, although black women were significantly less likely to be treated with tPA. Black women had more tPA exclusions than any other group. The primary reason for tPA exclusion in this study was not arriving within 3 hours of stroke symptom onset. Given the growth in incident strokes projected in minority groups in the next 4 decades, identifying factors that contribute to black women not arriving to the emergency department in time are of great importance."Stroke	PP	"Stroke occurs with greater frequency in men than in women across diverse ethnic backgrounds and nationalities. Work from our lab and others have revealed a sex-specific sensitivity to cerebral ischemia whereby males exhibit a larger extent of brain damage resulting from an ischemic event compared to females. Previous studies revealed that microRNA (miRNA) expression is regulated by cerebral ischemia in males; however, no studies to date have examined the effect of ischemia on miRNA responses in females. Thus, we examined miRNA responses in male and female brain in response to cerebral ischemia using miRNA arrays. These studies revealed that in male and female brains, ischemia leads to both a universal miRNA response as well as a sexually distinct response to challenge. Target prediction analysis of the miRNAs increased in male or female ischemic brain reveal sex-specific differences in gene targets and protein pathways. These data support that the mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic responses to cerebral ischemia includes distinct changes in miRNAs in male and female brain, in addition to a miRNA signature response to ischemia that is common to both. "Stroke	CLIN	"Research on cerebral stroke symptoms using hospital records has reported that women experience more nontraditional symptoms of stroke (eg, mental status change, pain) than men do. This is an important issue because nontraditional symptoms may delay the decision to get medical assistance and increase the difficulty of correct diagnosis. In the present study, we investigate sex differences in the stroke experience as described in stories on weblogs.The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using the Internet as a source of data for basic research on stroke experiences.Stroke experiences described in blogs were identified by using StoryUpgrade, a program that searches blog posts using a fictional prototype story. In this study, the prototype story was a description of a stroke experience. Retrieved stories coded by the researchers as relevant were used to update the search query and retrieve more stories using relevance feedback. Stories were coded for first- or third-person narrator, traditional and nontraditional patient symptoms, type of stroke, patient sex and age, delay before seeking medical assistance, and delay at hospital and in treatment.There were 191 relevant stroke stories of which 174 stories reported symptoms (52.3% female and 47.7% male patients). There were no sex differences for each traditional or nontraditional stroke symptom by chi-square analysis (all Ps>.05). Type of narrator, however, affected report of traditional and nontraditional symptoms. Female first-person narrators (ie, the patient) were more likely to report mental status change (56.3%, 27/48) than male first-person narrators (36.4%, 16/44), a marginally significant effect by logistic regression (P=.056), whereas reports of third-person narrators did not differ for women (27.9%, 12/43) and men (28.2%, 11/39) patients. There were more reports of at least 1 nontraditional symptom in the 92 first-person reports (44.6%, 41/92) than in the 82 third-person reports (25.6%, 21/82, P=.006). Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was reported in 67 and 29 stories, respectively. Nontraditional symptoms varied with stroke type with 1 or more nontraditional symptoms reported for 79.3% (23/29) of hemorrhagic stroke patients and 53.7% (36/67) of ischemic stroke patients (P=.001).The results replicate previous findings based on hospital interview data supporting the reliability of findings from weblogs. New findings include the effect of first- versus third-person narrator on sex differences in the report of nontraditional symptoms. This result suggests that narrator is an important variable to be examined in future studies. A fragmentary data problem limits some conclusions because important information, such as age, was not consistently reported. Age trends strengthen the feasibility of using the Internet for stroke research because older adults have significantly increased their Internet use in recent years."Stroke	EPI	"Post-stroke memory impairment is more common among older adults, women and blacks. It is unclear whether post-stroke differences reflect differential effects of stroke per se or differences in prestroke functioning. We compare memory trajectories before and after stroke by age, sex and race.Health and Retirement Study participants aged ‰ä´50 years (n = 17,341), with no stroke history at baseline, were interviewed biennially up to 10 years for first self- or proxy-reported stroke (n = 1,574). Segmented linear regression models were used to compare annual rates of memory change before and after stroke among 1,169 stroke survivors, 405 stroke decedents and 15,767 stroke-free participants. Effect modification was evaluated with analyses stratified by baseline age (‰ä_70 vs. >70), sex and race (white vs. nonwhite), and using interaction terms between age/sex/race indicators and annual memory change.Older (>70 years) adults experienced a faster memory decline before stroke (-0.19 vs. -0.10 points/year for survivors, -0.24 vs. -0.13 points/year for decedents, p < 0.001 for both interactions), and among stroke survivors, larger memory decrements (-0.64 vs. -0.26 points, p < 0.001) at stroke and faster memory decline (-0.15 vs. -0.07 points/year, p = 0.003) after stroke onset, compared to younger adults. Female stroke survivors experienced a faster prestroke memory decline than male stroke survivors (-0.14 vs. -0.10 points/year, p < 0.001). However, no sex differences were seen for other contrasts. Although whites had higher post-stroke memory scores than nonwhites, race was not associated with rate of memory decline during any period of time; i.e. race did not significantly modify the rate of decline before or after stroke or the immediate effect of stroke on memory.Older age predicted worse memory change before, at and after stroke onset. Sex and race differences in post-stroke memory outcomes might be attributable to prestroke disparities, which may be unrelated to cerebrovascular disease."Stroke	REVIEW	"Ischemic stroke is caused by critical reductions in blood flow to brain or spinal cord. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, and they respond to stroke by assuming an activated phenotype that releases cytotoxic cytokines, reactive oxygen species, proteases, and other factors. This acute, innate immune response may be teleologically adapted to limit infection, but in stroke this response can exacerbate injury by further damaging or killing nearby neurons and other cell types, and by recruiting infiltration of circulating cytotoxic immune cells. The microglial response requires hours to days to fully develop, and this time interval presents a clinically accessible time window for initiating therapy. Because of redundancy in cytotoxic microglial responses, the most effective therapeutic approach may be to target the global gene expression changes involved in microglial activation. Several classes of drugs can do this, including histone deacetylase inhibitors, minocycline and other PARP inhibitors, corticosteroids, and inhibitors of TNFë± and scavenger receptor signaling. Here we review the pre-clinical studies in which these drugs have been used to suppress microglial activation after stroke. We also review recent advances in the understanding of sex differences in the CNS inflammatory response, as these differences are likely to influence the efficacy of drugs targeting post-stroke brain inflammation. "Stroke	OUTC	"There is uncertainty surrounding the differences in outcomes after intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) between men and women. This study aimed to investigate the sex differences in clinical characteristics, severity and outcomes of Chinese ICH patients.The Nanjing First Hospital stroke registry was a hospital-based registry of stroke patients with 1-year prospective follow-up. From 2004 to 2008, a total of 651 consecutively recruited patients with acute ICH were enrolled. Primary outcome was death or dependency defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6 at 12 months. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether there were sex differences in clinical outcomes after ICH. Clinically important and biologically plausible risk factors of death or dependency were selected from available variables.A total of 615 ICH patients were enrolled. There was no significant difference in age (63.5 å± 14.0 vs. 62.7 å± 12.7, p = 0.500) between women and men. At baseline, men were more likely to be current smokers (46.1% vs. 3.6%, P < 0.001) or current drinkers (35.4% vs. 3.6%, P < 0.001), but women had higher admission National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores than men (10 vs. 8, P = 0.039). Women also had higher rates of death or dependency at 3, 6, and 12 months (61.2% vs. 46.8%, P = 0.001; 56.7% vs. 45.3%, P = 0.009; and 51.8% vs. 44.1%, P = 0.065; respectively). After adjustment for age, existing hypertension and diabetes, prior stroke, previous ischemic heart disease, previous atrial fibrillation, current smoking and alcohol consumption status, pre-stroke dependency, onset-to-door time, admission NIHSS score, admission systolic blood pressure and location of bleeding, the association between the female gender and death or dependency remained statistical significant at 3 months [odds ratio (OR): 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-2.89], but did not reach statistical significance at 6 months (OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 0.99-2.54) and 12 months (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.77-1.95).In a Chinese population, women are more likely to be dead or dependent early after ICH than men. However, this gender difference gradually attenuates over the period of 12 months."Stroke	PP	"Stroke is the primary cause of long-term disability in the United States. Interestingly, mounting evidence has suggested potential sex differences in the response to stroke treatment in patients as, at least in part, distinct cell death programs may be triggered in females and males following stroke. The NIH has recognized that females are strikingly under-represented in pre-clinical trials. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) is a major kinase that is activated by elevated intracellular calcium. It has recently been suggested that CaMKK and CaMK IV, a downstream target molecule, are neuroprotective in stroke in males. In this study, we examined stroke outcomes in ovariectomized CaMKK ë_ and CaMK IV deficient females. Cell death/survival signaling and inflammatory responses were assessed.Our results demonstrated that CaMKK ë_ or CaMK IV KO exacerbated both ischemic injury and behavioral deficits in female mice. Genetic deletion of CaMKK ë_ or CaMK IV increased hemorrhagic transformation after stroke, and this was associated with both increased MMP9 activity and loss of the blood brain barrier (BBB) protein collagen IV. Transcriptional inactivation was observed in mice lacking either CaMKK ë_ or CaMK IV, as indicated by reduced levels of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) proteins. Finally, inhibiting this pathway exacerbated the inflammatory response to stroke as CaMKK ë_ or CaMK IV KO mice had increased levels of the pro-inflammatory serum cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFë±) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) after stroke. This suggests that the CaMKK pathway is involved in the immune response to brain injury.Inhibition of CaMKK signaling exacerbated stroke outcome and increased BBB impairment, transcriptional inactivation and inflammatory responses in females after stroke. Therefore, CaMKK signaling may be a potential target for stroke treatment in both males and females."Stroke	MANAG	"Women are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease, often experiencing poorer outcomes following a cardiovascular event. Evidence points to inequities in processes of care as a potential contributing factor. This study sought to determine whether any sex differences exist in adherence to process of care guidelines for cardiovascular disease within primary care practices in Ontario, Canada.This is a secondary analysis of pooled cross-sectional baseline data collected through a larger quality improvement initiative known as the Improved Delivery of Cardiovascular Care (IDOCC). Chart abstraction was performed for 4,931 patients from 84 primary care practices in Eastern Ontario who had, or were at high risk of, cardiovascular disease. Measures examining adherence to guidelines associated with nine areas of cardiovascular care (coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), stroke/transient ischemic attack, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking cessation, and weight management) were collected. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate sex differences, adjusting for age, physician remuneration, and rurality.Women were significantly less likely to have their lipid profiles taken (OR=1.17, 95% CI 1.03-1.33), be prescribed lipid lowering medication for dyslipidemia (OR=1.54, 95% CI 1.20-1.97), and to be prescribed ASA following stroke (OR=1.56, 95% CI 1.39-1.75). Women with PVD were significantly less likely to be prescribed ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (OR=1.74, 95% CI 1.25-2.41) and lipid lowering medications (OR=1.95, 95% CI 1.46-2.62) or ASA (OR=1.59, 95% CI 1.43-1.78). However, women were more likely to have two blood pressure measurements taken and to be referred to a dietician or weight loss program. Male patients with diabetes were less likely to be prescribed glycemic control medication (OR=0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.86).Sex disparities exist in the quality of cardiovascular care in Canadian primary care practices, which tend to favour men. Women with PVD have a particularly high risk of not receiving appropriate medications. Our findings indicate that improvements in care delivery should be made to address these issues, particularly with regard to the prescribing of recommended medications for women, and preventive measures for men."Stroke	PP	"Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), a key enzyme in the metabolism of vasodilatory epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), is sexually dimorphic, suppressed by estrogen, and contributes to underlying sex differences in cerebral blood flow and injury after cerebral ischemia. We tested the hypothesis that sEH inhibition or gene deletion in reproductively senescent (RS) female mice would increase cerebral perfusion and decrease infarct size following stroke. RS (15-18 month old) and young (3-4 month old) female sEH knockout (sEHKO) mice and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to 45 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with laser Doppler perfusion monitoring. WT mice were treated with vehicle or a sEH inhibitor t-AUCB at the time of reperfusion and every 24 h thereafter for 3 days. Differences in regional cerebral blood flow were measured in vivo using optical microangiography (OMAG). Infarct size was measured 3 days after reperfusion. Infarct size and cerebral perfusion 24 h after MCAO were not altered by age. Both sEH gene deletion and sEH inhibition increased cortical perfusion 24 h after MCAO. Neither sEH gene deletion nor sEH inhibition reduced infarct size in young mice. However, sEH gene deletion, but not sEH inhibition of the hydrolase domain of the enzyme, decreased infarct size in RS mice. Results of these studies show that sEH gene deletion and sEH inhibition enhance cortical perfusion following MCAO and sEH gene deletion reduces damage after ischemia in RS female mice; however this neuroprotection in absent is young mice. "Stroke	CLIN	"Post-stroke depression (PSD) is associated with poor clinical and functional outcomes, and women are likely to experience PSD more than men. Although stress is related to depression, and women report greater emotional reactivity to stressful life events, the link between stress and gender is yet to be examined relative to PSD. Further, electronic momentary assessment (EMA), a mobile technology, has not been used to assess stressful life events and PSD in real time and in the natural environments of daily life. The purpose of the current study was to examine gender differences in the relationship of stress and PSD using EMA.Individuals admitted to the Stroke Center at the University of Bordeaux were contacted for participation in a prospective study of symptoms and experiences in daily life using ambulatory monitoring. Forty-three post-stroke patients (47% female) completed electronic assessments of life events, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms (i.e., sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue, concentration difficulties, appetite change, negative thoughts, hopelessness) during their daily life for one week. Patients also completed a clinician-administered standardized depression scale at baseline and three-month follow-up.Using EMA, participants responded to 83.7% of the electronic interviews for a total of 1,140 observations across diverse daily life contexts. Stressful events of any degree of negativity were reported at over one-third (37.3%) of all EMA assessments. The severity of depressive symptoms as assessed in daily life through EMA was greater in women following stroke than in men. Further, there was a significant association between EMA-assessed depressive symptoms and daily life stress for women, but not men. This association was due primarily to three specific depressive symptoms: sad mood, fatigue, and appetite change. No difference was observed between men and women in standardized depression assessments administered during clinic visits at baseline or three-month follow-up.Greater reactivity to stressful life events and a link between stress reactivity and depressive symptoms were found in female as compared to male post-stroke patients. Gender differences in depressive symptoms were identified using EMA data collected during daily life as contrasted with the use of a standard assessment during clinic visits. Mobile technologies may help to identify important real-time behaviors and symptoms that are not observable by standard clinical assessments employed at regular clinic visits. Further, future research should examine the overall and gender-specific benefits of stress-based interventions to reduce the risk of PSD for adults."Stroke	PP	"Epidemiological studies suggest that sex has a role in the pathogenesis of cardioembolic stroke. Since stroke is a vascular disease, identifying sexually dimorphic gene expression changes in blood leukocytes can inform on sex-specific risk factors, response and outcome biology. We aimed to examine the sexually dimorphic immune response following cardioembolic stroke by studying the differential gene expression in peripheral white blood cells.Blood samples from patients with cardioembolic stroke were obtained at ‰ä_3 hours (prior to treatment), 5 hours and 24 hours (after treatment) after stroke onset (n‰Û_=‰Û_23; 69 samples) and compared with vascular risk factor controls without symptomatic vascular diseases (n‰Û_=‰Û_23, 23 samples) (ANCOVA, false discovery rate p‰ä_0.05, |fold change| ‰ä´1.2). mRNA levels were measured on whole-genome Affymetrix microarrays. There were more up-regulated than down-regulated genes in both sexes, and females had more differentially expressed genes than males following cardioembolic stroke. Female gene expression was associated with cell death and survival, cell-cell signaling and inflammation. Male gene expression was associated with cellular assembly, organization and compromise. Immune response pathways were over represented at ‰ä_3, 5 and 24 h after stroke in female subjects but only at 24 h in males. Neutrophil-specific genes were differentially expressed at 3, 5 and 24 h in females but only at 5 h and 24 h in males.There are sexually dimorphic immune cell expression profiles following cardioembolic stroke. Future studies are needed to confirm the findings using qRT-PCR in an independent cohort, to determine how they relate to risk and outcome, and to compare to other causes of ischemic stroke."Stroke	REVIEW	"Cell therapy now constitutes an important area of regenerative medicine. The aging of the population has mandated the discovery and development of new and innovative therapeutic modalities to combat devastating disorders such as stroke. Menstrual blood and Sertoli cells represent two sources of viable transplantable cells that are gender-specific, both of which appear to have potential as donor cells for transplantation in stroke. During the subacute phase of stroke, the use of autologous cells offers effective and practical clinical application and is suggestive of the many benefits of using the aforementioned gender-specific cells. For example, in addition to being exceptionally immunosuppressive, testis-derived Sertoli cells secrete many growth and trophic factors and have been shown to aid in the functional recovery of animals transplanted with fetal dopaminergic cells. Correspondingly, menstrual blood cells are easily obtainable and exhibit angiogenic characteristics, proliferative capability, and pluripotency. Of further interest is the ability of menstrual blood cells, following transplantation in stroke models, to migrate to the infarct site, secrete neurotrophic factors, regulate the inflammatory response, and be steered towards neural differentiation. From cell isolation to transplantation, we emphasize in this review paper the practicality and relevance of the experimental and clinical use of gender-specific stem cells, such as Sertoli cells and menstrual blood cells, in the treatment of stroke. "Stroke	OUTC	"OBJECTIVE. We sought to determine the association between minimal depression, upper-extremity (UE) impairment, and UE motor function in a cohort of participants with subacute stroke. METHOD. We conducted a retrospective, secondary analysis of an interventional study. Correlational analyses were performed using the following outcome measures: the UE section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FM), the functional ability section of the Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). RESULTS. We found a negative correlation between BDI-II and both the FM (-.120, p = .196) and the AMAT (-.110, p = .275); however, this correlation was not statistically significant. Women exhibited higher depression scores (8.75 å± 0.78) than men (6.29 å± 0.46; p = .008). CONCLUSION. Low levels of depression are not associated with UE motor impairment and function in people with minimal to moderate UE disability levels. Poststroke depression occurs more frequently in women, warranting additional research on sex-specific differences. Given the proliferation of UE therapies targeting this group, this information is important for effective therapy planning and implementation. "Stroke	EPI	"Female patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are at increased risk of stroke. It is unclear what contributes to the gender-related differences in stroke and mortality amongst AF patients. This is pertinent since oral anticoagulation use results in a significant reduction in stroke, as well as all-cause mortality.We investigated gender-related risk factors for stroke and mortality in a cohort of Chinese patients with AF.We studied 1034 AF patients (27% females, median age 75 years) who were followed-up for an average of 1.9 years for the principal primary endpoint of 'ischaemic stroke and death'. Gender-specific effect of risk factors for stroke and death was analyzed.Patients at high stroke risk (CHADS2 or CHADS2-VASc ‰ä´ 2) and HAS-BLED ‰ä´ 3 had higher rates of ischaemic stroke and death, but ischaemic stroke rates in females with HAS-BLED ‰ä´ 3 did not differ between CHADS2 0-1 and ‰ä´ 2 (~3 per 100 person-years). On multivariate analysis of non-anticoagulated patients (n=885), independent predictors of 'ischaemic stroke and death' in both males and females were age>75, prior stroke and renal dysfunction (all p<0.05). Independent predictors of 'ischaemic stroke' in females were prior stroke, vascular disease and renal dysfunction (all p<0.05). When females were compared to males, adjusted for baseline characteristics, independent predictors for 'ischaemic stroke and death' amongst females were prior stroke (hazard ratio, HR 2.40; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.17-4.91, p=0.017) and renal dysfunction (HR 5.30; 95%CI 2.39-11.74, p<0.001). When females were compared to males, renal dysfunction remained a predictor for the secondary endpoints of ischaemic stroke (HR 4.37, p=0.05) and all-cause mortality (HR 4.15, p=0.003).Renal dysfunction may be a contributor to the greater risk of stroke and death in female Chinese patients with AF. This increased risk is largely driven by the impact on all-cause mortality."Stroke	MANAG	"A recent meta-analysis showed that women with acute ischemic stroke are less likely to receive treatment with intravenous alteplase than men. The aim of this study was to assess sex differences in treatment with intravenous alteplase and to explore the reasons for these differences.We analyzed data from the Promoting Acute Thrombolysis for Ischaemic Stroke (PRACTISE) study. We applied a multiple logistic regression model and expressed the association between sex and treatment with an age-adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval.In total, 5515 patients were included in PRACTISE. Women were an average of 4 years older than men. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 6 in women and 5 in men. Fewer women were treated with intravenous alteplase (11% versus 14%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-1.0). However, fewer women arrived within 4 hours after onset (27% versus 33%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-0.9).Fewer women present themselves within 4 hours from stroke onset than men and consequently less often receive thrombolytic treatment. This difference may be caused by the older age of women on average and consequently women more often living alone.http://www.controlled-trials.com. Unique identifier: ISRCTN20405426."Stroke	REVIEW	"Cerebral stroke continues to be a major cause of death and the leading cause of long-term disability in developed countries. Evidence reviewed here suggests that gender influences various aspects of the clinical spectrum of ischemic stroke, in terms of influencing how a patients present with ischemic stroke through to how they respond to treatment. In addition, this review focuses on discussing the various pathologic mechanisms of ischemic stroke that may differ according to gender and compares how intrinsic and hormonal mechanisms may account for such gender differences. All clinical trials to date investigating putative neuroprotective treatments for ischemic stroke have failed, and it may be that our understanding of the injury cascade initiated after ischemic injury is incomplete. Revealing aspects of the pathophysiological consequences of ischemic stroke that are gender specific may enable gender relevant and effective neuroprotective strategies to be identified. Thus, it is possible to conclude that gender does, in fact, have an important role in ischemic stroke and must be factored into experimental and clinical investigations of ischemic stroke. "Stroke	OUTC	"We aimed to determine the association between the neuro-radiological characteristics of stroke lesions and post-stroke major depression among survivors in Ibadan, Nigeria. This is in the background of a paucity of information on the clinico-pathological correlation of post-stroke emotional responses among African Survivors.We studied 30 stroke survivors receiving physiotherapy. The radiological characteristics of the stroke lesions were documented using computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans in the acute phase of the stroke. While the presence of major depressive disorder meeting criteria in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual was assessed using the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), between 3 months and 2 years after. The association between lesion characteristics and depression was explored using logistic regression analysis.Nine (30.0%) stroke survivors met criteria for major depressive disorder. There were significant differences in their gender. The differences in the lesion types approached the set level of significance in survivors with or without major depressive disorder. There were however no differences when considering hemispheric lateralization or intra-hemispheric lesion location. Being female, but not the lesion characteristics was strongly associated with post-stroke major depressive disorderLesion characteristics documented in the acute phase of stroke could not predict the occurrence of major depressive disorder during rehabilitation in this sample. The occurrence of depression among stroke survivors may ultimately be determined by a combination of factors."Stroke	PP	"Transient global cerebral ischemia due to cardiac arrest followed by resuscitation (CA/CPR) causes significant neurological damage in vulnerable neuron populations within the brain, such as hippocampal CA1 neurons. In recent years, we have implicated the transient receptor potential M2 (TRPM2) channel as a mediator of ischemic injury to neurons. We previously demonstrated that genetic and pharmacological strategies that reduce TRPM2 function preferentially protect male neurons in vitro and reduce infarct volume following experimental stroke. Due to the narrow therapeutic window for intervention following ischemic stroke, it is important to assess the role of TRPM2 in other models of cerebral ischemia. Therefore, this study utilized a modified mouse model of CA/CPR to mimic more accurately the clinical condition by maintaining body and head temperatures near the physiological range throughout. Here, we report that inhibition of TRPM2 activity with clotrimazole reduces hippocampal CA1 neuronal injury when administered 30 min after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Consistent with our previous observations, neuroprotection was observed in male mice and no effect on injury was observed in the female. These findings provide further evidence for TRPM2 as a target for protection against cerebral ischemia in the male brain."Stroke	OUTC	"The importance of gender as an independent risk factor for poor outcome is not clear. We examined gender differences in patients' characteristic, management and outcome at discharge and 3-months after acute stroke in a national hospital-based registry.Data were derived from the triennial two-month national Acute Stroke Israeli Registry (Feb-March 2004, March-April 2007, April-May 2010). Unselected patients in all Israeli hospitals (n = 28) were included. Outcome at 3-month was assessed in a sub-sample. Logistic regression models were used in the study of gender as an independent risk factor for poor outcome.In total, 5034 patients (88.5% ischemic stroke, 9.6% ICH and 1.9% undetermined stroke) were included, of them 2285 (45.4%) women. Follow-up at 3-month was completed for 1040 patients, 41.9% women. Women showed higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors in-hospital death (p = 0.007) and poor functional outcome (p < 0.0001). Following adjustment for age, prior disability, NIHSS, prior stroke and risk factors, risk estimates (ORs, 95%CI) for women compared to men were 0.72 (0.55-0.96) for in-hospital death, 1.03 (0.83-1.29) for discharge to a nursing home or death, and 1.01 (0.86-1.20) for disability. Poor outcomes at 3-month were significantly more common in women; however, adjusted risk estimates were not significantly increased: OR 0.95 (95%CI 0.50-1.81) for death at 3-months, 1.41 (0.99-2.01) for Barthel Index ‰ä_ 60, 1.24 (0.90-1.72) for dependency and 0.88 (0.55-1.39) for living in a nursing home or death.Gender-differences in risk of death and poor functional outcome after stroke are mainly explained by dissimilarities in patients' characteristics and stroke severity."Stroke	EPI	"Sex differences in stroke characteristics and outcomes have been inconsistent. The goal of this study was to determine the influence of sex on underlying patient characteristics, stroke subtypes and conditions, and outcomes after ischemic stroke from a nationwide registration study.A total of 33,953 patients with acute ischemic stroke, including 13,323 women, were registered in a multicenter, hospital-based registration study based on a computerized database from 162 Japanese institutes (the Japan Standard Stroke Registry Study) between January 2000 and November 2007.Women were significantly older than men at stroke onset (75.0 å± 11.7 v 69.3 å± 11.4 years; P < .0001). After age adjustment, women more frequently had cardioembolic events (odds ratio [OR] 1.090; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.036-1.146; P = .0009) and other strokes (OR 1.177; 95% CI 1.079-1.284; P = .0003) and were more hypertensive (OR 1.056; 95% CI 1.006-1.108; P = .0267) and more dyslipidemic (OR 1.301; 95% CI 1.234-1.373; P < .0001) than men. After multivariate adjustment, onset-to-arrival time was longer (ë_ = 0.0554; P = .026), the initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was higher (ë_ = 0.1565; P < .001), and the duration of hospitalization was longer (ë_ = 0.035; P = .010) in women than in men. At hospital discharge, women less commonly had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 1 (OR 0.802; 95% CI 0.741-0.868; P < .0001) and more commonly had a mRS score of 4 to 6 (OR 1.410; 95% CI 1.293-1.537; P < .0001) than men.Women developed more severe strokes than men in Japan. After multivariate adjustment for initial severity and other characteristics, acute care hospital stays were longer and stroke outcomes at discharge were worse in women than in men."Stroke	OUTC	"Providing regional and state-specific prognosis factors for stroke patients has both clinical and public health importance. Results from previous studies of sex difference in stroke case fatality have been mixed. The current study links stroke hospitalizations to community-based mortality records to examine sex difference in stroke case fatality and associated prognosis factors.Hospital discharge data and death certificate data from January 2005 to December 2009 in Nebraska were linked. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate sex differences in 30-day mortality, and the Cox proportional hazard model was used to predict overall survival.A total of 15,806 patients were included. Females were more likely to die during the 30 days after stroke hospitalization. However, there was no significant difference in overall survival in the multivariate analysis that controlled for age, comorbidity, and rehabilitation factors. Females were more likely to have comorbidities, such as atrial fibrillation, anemia, and heart failure, while males were more likely to have chronic kidney disease. In addition, males were more likely to receive rehabilitation services after stroke.Among persons hospitalized with a stroke in Nebraska between 2005 and 2009, the crude case fatality rate was 50% higher in women. However, after accounting for age and other variables, adjusted mortality rates were essentially the same for men and women."Stroke	REVIEW	"Stroke is one of the leading causes of adult disability and the fourth leading cause of mortality in the US. Stroke disproportionately occurs among the elderly, where the disease is more likely to be fatal or lead to long-term supportive care. Animal models, where the ischemic insult can be controlled more precisely, also confirm that aged animals sustain more severe strokes as compared to young animals. Furthermore, the neuroprotection usually seen in younger females when compared to young males is not observed in older females. The preclinical literature thus provides a valuable resource for understanding why the aging brain is more susceptible to severe infarction. In this review, we discuss the hypothesis that stroke severity in the aging brain may be associated with reduced functional capacity of critical support cells. Specifically, we focus on astrocytes, that are critical for detoxification of the brain microenvironment and endothelial cells, which play a crucial role in maintaining the blood brain barrier. In view of the sex difference in stroke severity, this review also discusses studies of middle-aged acyclic females as well as the effects of the estrogen on astrocytes and endothelial cells. "Stroke	PP	"Atherothrombotic cerebral infarction [atherothrombotic stroke (ATS)] shares common risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms with coronary artery disease (CAD), and both diseases appear to have common susceptibility loci. The muscle RAS oncogene homolog gene (MRAS) has been identified as a susceptibility locus for CAD and is implicated in atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes of MRAS are associated with increased risk of ATS in a population of Han Chinese.A case-controlled association study was conducted in which only patients with ATS (identified as a major subtype in the Korean modification of the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification) were enrolled. Subgroup analyses were carried out to determine whether the effect of the MRAS polymorphism was specific to age and gender among the subjects.In total, 194 ATS and 186 control subjects were included in the present study. Two tagging SNPs were identified in MRAS (rs40593 and rs3755751). A multivariate regression analysis revealed a positive association between rs40593 and ATS under dominant and additive models after adjustment for covariates. Subgroup analyses revealed that there were no gender differences with respect to allele or genotype frequencies between the groups. The AG genotype for rs40593 (p=0.028), the CT genotype for rs3755751 (p=0.036), and G-allele carriers (AG plus GG) for rs40593 (p=0.015) exhibited a significant protective effect among those aged ‰ä´45 years. For the haplotype analysis, ATS subjects aged ‰ä´45 years had a higher frequency of the ACAC haplotype (76.0%) than the controls (68.1%; p<0.05); that haplotype was associated with an increased risk of ATS.The obtained data suggest a positive association between MRAS and ATS among the Han Chinese. Further studies should be performed with larger sample and among different ethnic populations, and gene-gene or gene-environment interactions should be considered."Stroke	OUTC	"Poststroke cognitive decline (PSCD) is an important consequence of stroke that may be more severe in women than in men. The existence of any gender differences in PSCD among Mexican Americans, and their potential mechanisms, such as blood pressure (BP), remain unknown. We assessed PSCD stratified on gender in older Mexican Americans and explored the influence of pre- and poststroke systolic BP on PSCD.Among 1576 nondemented, stroke-free adults 60 years of age or older when recruited between 1998 and 1999 in the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA) cohort, we examined pre- and poststroke longitudinal changes in Spanish English Verbal Learning test scores (WL), a verbal memory test, and errors on the Modified Mini Mental State Examination (3MSE) scores, a global cognition test, stratified by gender, adjusting for baseline and time-varying covariates with linear mixed effects models.We identified 151 adults (mean age 72 å± 8 years) with incident first-ever stroke during 10 years of follow-up. After adjustment for age, education, and time-varying depressive symptoms, 3MSE errors increased by 22% per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.8-36.7%) in men and 13.2% per year (95% CI 3.5-22.9%) in women over the poststroke period. Poststroke WL scores improved by 0.05 words per year (95% CI -0.24 to 0.33) in men and by 0.09 words per year (95% CI -0.16 to 0.34) in women. Results persisted after adjustment for time-varying systolic BP.Among this population of older Mexican Americans, PSCD did not differ by gender. We found no evidence that systolic BP influenced PSCD in women or men."Stroke	PP	"Inflammatory responses in the brain after cerebral ischemia have been studied extensively in male mice, but not female mice, thus potentially giving a less-than-accurate view of gender associated pathological processes. In humans, cerebral infarcts are typically smaller in premenopausal females than in age-matched males. In the current study, we confirmed smaller infarcts in female vs. male mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion and 96 h of reperfusion. Moreover, we explored immunological alterations related to this difference and found that the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes was significantly higher in spleens in males than females, with increased expression of the activation markers, CD69 and CD44. In contrast, the percentage of CD8+ T lymphocytes was significantly higher in spleens of females than males, leading to the identification of a small but distinct population of IL-10-secreting CD8+CD122+ suppressor T cells that were also increased in females. Finally, we observed that males have a greater percentage of activated macrophages/microglia in the brain than females, as well as increased expression of the VLA-4 adhesion molecule in both brain and spleen. This new information suggesting gender-dependent immunological mechanisms in stroke implies that effective treatments for human stroke may also be gender specific."Stroke	MANAG	"Studies suggest that women are less likely than men to receive intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Relatively little is known about whether this sex disparity in AIS management extends beyond IV tPA use, reflects national practice patterns, or is changing.Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1997 to 2006 were used to identify adults (‰ä´18åÊyears of age) who were discharged with a primary diagnosis of AIS (n = 4,453,207) in the United States. Of 605,960 individuals admitted to 1056 hospitals that performed reperfusion/revascularization procedures, sex-specific rates of cerebrovascular reperfusion (e.g., IV tPA, intra-arterial therapy, angioplasty, stent, or carotid endarterectomy [CEA]), and cardiac reperfusion (e.g., catheterization, angioplasty, stent, or bypass graft) were determined before and after adjustment for sociodemographic, clinical, and hospital factors.Men were more likely than women to receive IV tPA (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.42), catheter angiography (PR 1.36, 95% CI 1.33-1.38), intracranial or extracranial angioplasty/stent (PR 1.73, 95% CI 1.49-2.01), CEA (PR 1.79, 95% CI 1.72-1.86), or any cardiac reperfusion therapy (PR 1.62, 95% CI 1.53-1.71). Multivariable adjustment slightly attenuated the sex disparity. Use of all procedures except CEA rose from 1997 to 2006 in both sexes, but IV tPA use increased at a higher rate for women (compared to men); by 2006, there was no sex difference.Over the last decade, women hospitalized for AIS in the United States were less likely than men to receive cerebrovascular and cardiac reperfusion therapies. However, the IV tPA treatment sex disparity may have been eliminated."Stroke	MANAG	"Studies show that women are more likely to receive do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders after acute medical illnesses than men. However, the sex differences in the use of DNR orders after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) have not been described.We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive patients hospitalized for acute ICH at a tertiary stroke center between 2006 and 2010. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to test for associations between female sex and early (<24 hours of presentation) DNR orders.A total of 372 consecutive ICH patients without preexisting DNR orders were studied. Overall, 82 (22%) patients had early DNR orders after being hospitalized with ICH. In the fully adjusted model, early DNR orders were more likely in women (odds ratio, 3.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.51-6.70), higher age (odds ratio, 1.09 per year; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.12), larger ICH volume (odds ratio, 1.01 per cm(3); 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.02), and lower initial GCS score (odds ratio, 0.76 per point; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.84). Early DNR orders were less likely when the patients were transferred from another hospital (odds ratio, 0.28, 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.76).Women are more likely to receive early DNR orders after ICH than men. Further prospective studies are needed to determine factors contributing to the sex variation in the use of early DNR order after ICH."Stroke	REVIEW	"Cerebral stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability and a major cause of death in the developed world. The total incidence of stroke is projected to rise substantially over the next 20åÊyears as a result of the rising elderly population. Although age is one of the most significant prognostic markers for poor outcome after stroke, very few experimental studies have been conducted in aged animals. Importantly, sex differences in both vulnerability to stroke and outcome after cerebral ischaemia have frequently been reported and attributed to the action of steroid hormones. Progesterone is a candidate neuroprotective factor for stroke, although the majority of pre-clinical studies have focused on using young, healthy adult animals. In terms of cerebral stroke, males and postmenopausal females represent the groups at highest risk of cerebral stroke and these categories can be modelled using either aged or ovariectomised female animals. In this review, we discuss the importance of conducting experimental studies in aged animals compared to young, healthy animals, as well as the impact this has on experimental outcomes. In addition, we focus on reviewing the studies that have been conducted to date examining the neuroprotective potential of progesterone in aged animals. Importantly, the limited studies that have been conducted in aged animals do lend further support to progesterone as a therapeutic option after ischaemic stroke that warrants further investigation. "Stroke	EPI	"Risk factors for IS in young adults differ between genders and evolve with age, but data on the age- and gender-specific differences by stroke etiology are scare. These features were compared based on individual patient data from 15 European stroke centers.Stroke etiology was reported in detail for 3331 patients aged 15-49åÊyears with first-ever IS according to Trial of Org in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria: large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA), cardioembolism (CE), small-vessel occlusion (SVO), other determined etiology, or undetermined etiology. CE was categorized into low- and high-risk sources. Other determined group was divided into dissection and other non-dissection causes. Comparisons were done using logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, and center heterogeneity.Etiology remained undetermined in 39.6%. Other determined etiology was found in 21.6%, CE in 17.3%, SVO in 12.2%, and LAA in 9.3%. Other determined etiology was more common in females and younger patients, with cervical artery dissection being the single most common etiology (12.8%). CE was more common in younger patients. Within CE, the most frequent high-risk sources were atrial fibrillation/flutter (15.1%) and cardiomyopathy (11.5%). LAA, high-risk sources of CE, and SVO were more common in males. LAA and SVO showed an increasing frequency with age. No significant etiologic distribution differences were found amongst southern, central, or northern Europe.The etiology of IS in young adults has clear gender-specific patterns that change with age. A notable portion of these patients remains without an evident stroke mechanism according to TOAST criteria."Stroke	PP	"Previous literature suggests that cell death pathways activated after cerebral ischemia differ between the sexes. While caspase-dependent mechanisms predominate in the female brain, caspase-independent cell death induced by the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) predominates in the male brain. PARP-1 gene deletion decreases infarction volume in the male brain, but paradoxically increases damage in PARP-1 knockout females.This study examined stroke-induced changes in NAD+, a key energy molecule involved in PARP-1 activation in both sexes.Mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and NAD+ levels were assessed. Caspase-3 activity and nuclear translocation were assessed 6h after ischemia. In additional cohorts, Nicotinamide (500 mg/kg i.p.) a precursor of NAD+ or vehicle was administered and infarction volume was measured 24h after ischemia.Males have higher baseline NAD+ levels than females. Significant stroke-induced NAD+ depletion occurred in males and ovariectomized females but not in intact females. PARP-1 deletion prevented the stroke-induced loss in NAD+ in males, but worsened NAD+ loss in PARP-1 deficient females. Preventing NAD+ loss with nicotinamide reduced infarct in wild-type males and PARP-1 knockout mice of both sexes, with no effect in WT females. Caspase-3 activity was significantly increased in PARP-1 knockout females compared to males and wild-type females, this was reversed with nicotinamide.Sex differences exist in baseline and stroke-induced NAD+ levels. Nicotinamide protected males and PARP knockout mice, but had minimal effects in the wild-type female brain. This may be secondary to differences in energy metabolism between the sexes."Stroke	REVIEW	"Cell therapy is a major discipline of regenerative medicine that has been continually growing over the last two decades. The aging of the population necessitates discovery of therapeutic innovations to combat debilitating disorders, such as stroke. Menstrual blood and Sertoli cells are two gender-specific sources of viable transplantable cells for stroke therapy. The use of autologous cells for the subacute phase of stroke offers practical clinical application. Menstrual blood cells are readily available, display proliferative capacity, pluripotency and angiogenic features, and, following transplantation in stroke models, have the ability to migrate to the infarct site, regulate the inflammatory response, secrete neurotrophic factors, and have the possibility to differentiate into neural lineage. Similarly, the testis-derived Sertoli cells secrete many growth and trophic factors, are highly immunosuppressive, and exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of neurological disorders. We highlight the practicality of experimental and clinical application of menstrual blood cells and Sertoli cells to treat stroke, from cell isolation and cryopreservation to administration."Stroke	REVIEW	"Stroke is a significant cause of death and long-term disability in the USA. The incidence, mortality, and outcomes of stroke are significantly different between men and women. As with many diseases that affect men and women differently, an understanding on the reasons underlying those differences is critical to effective diagnosis and treatment. This review will examine the sex differences in stroke in both humans and animal models of stroke and review what is known about potential mechanisms underlying these differences. It is clear that there is a complex interaction between hormonal, genetic, and unknown factors at play in generating the sex differences in stroke."Stroke	EPI	"The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF), treatment rates of AF and the factors underlying awareness and treatment, in a large nationally representative study.A population sample of people aged 50+, living in the Republic of Ireland, were recruited as part of The Irish longitudinal study on ageing. Ten-minute electrocardiogram recordings were obtained (n = 4890), and analysed to detect AF. Self-reported arrhythmias, subjective and objective health measures (cardiovascular diseases, CHA2DS2-VASc variables and blood pressure) and medications were also recorded. Logistic regressions were used to determine associations with outcomes of presence of AF, lack of awareness and untreated AF.Overall prevalence of AF was 3% (95% CI: 2.4-3.7%), with a marked age gradient and sex difference [4.8% (men) vs. 1.4% (women); P < 0.0001]. In total, 67.8% were at high risk of stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc ‰ä´ 2), of whom 59.3% were inadequately treated. A high proportion of 38.1% were unaware of having AF. CHA2DS2-VASc nor HAS-BLED score influenced awareness or treatment. Lack of awareness was associated with lower education (P = 0.01), lower cognition (P = 0.04), rural location (OR = 3.67; P = 0.02) and number of general practitioner visits (P = 0.01), whereas untreated AF was influenced by frailty status (P = 0.04).With projected doubling of numbers of persons over 80 in the next 30 years in the British Isles, detection and management of AF is pressing. Two-thirds of adults at high risk of stroke were inadequately treated. More regular screening for AF, application of criteria for stroke and bleeding risk and awareness of factors influencing diagnosis and treatment is recommended."Stroke	Clinical	"Sex related differences in cardiovascular disease and stroke are issues of increasing interest. The aim of this study was to evaluate for sex differences in clinical presentation, severity of stroke and outcome in a population of patients admitted to 4 public and 1 private hospitals in three different regions of Italy.All hospital admissions for ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke (ICD-IX code 434 and 431 respectively) between January 1st and December 31st, 2011 at five different hospitals located in three different regions of Italy: Milan (North), Rome and Perugia (Center), and Palermo (South) have been recorded and sex-differences have been evaluated.A total of 1272 stroke patients were included in the analysis: 1152 ischemic and 120 haemorrhagic strokes, 567 women and 705 men. Compared to men, women were significantly older (mean age 75.2 SD 13.7 vs 71.5 SD 12.5 years, P<0.001) and their stroke severities at onset, measured by NIHSS, were also compared to men (10 SD 8 vs 8 SD 7, P<0.001). Female sex was associated with a worse functional prognosis measured by modified Rankin Scale score (mRS‰ä´3), as well as in-hospital mortality, without reaching statistical significance. There were no observed significant differences between sexes regarding the number of patients treated with thrombolytic therapy. Analysis of the distribution of risk factors between sexes showed a prevalence of atrial fibrillation in women (29% vs 21%, P=0.003).Both stroke severity and functional outcome were worse in women."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Pediatric stroke, birth to 18 years, is a significant cause of long-term disability in the United States; however, there is currently little experimental data on the pathophysiology of childhood stroke owing to lack of animal models. We developed a novel mouse model of experimental childhood-onset arterial ischemic stroke to characterize the sex-specific response of the adolescent brain to cerebral ischemia and assess the neuroprotective effect of estrogen at this developmental stage.Postnatal day 20 to 25 mice were subjected to 90 minutes experimental stroke via the intraluminal filament middle cerebral artery occlusion model and ischemic damage assessed 22 hours after reperfusion. Real-time quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed 22 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion to determine the effects of ischemia and estrogen treatment on the proapoptotic gene Bax.Ischemic injury did not differ between male and female juvenile (postnatal day 20-25) mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion. However, estrogen reduced ischemic injury in female mice, whereas having no effect in juvenile males. No differences in estrogen receptor expression were observed on postnatal day between 20 males and females. In contrast, estrogen minimized the ischemia-induced increase in the proapoptotic gene Bax in female mice, whereas having no effect on Bax induction in the male brain.Focal ischemia has fundamentally different effects in the juvenile brain compared with the adult, as evidenced by the lack of sex difference in ischemic injury in the murine postnatal day 20 to 25 middle cerebral artery occlusion model and the sexually dimorphic response to estrogen neuroprotection."Stroke	EPI	"Studies about stroke in Saudi Arabia are limited. This retrospective study aims to determine the clinical characteristics of Saudi patients with heart failure (HF) with and without subsequent stroke, and also to find out whether gender differences exist in the presentation of HF patients who had stroke.Retrospective study done at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from 2002-2008.A total of 293 patient (151 males, 142 females) charts from 2002-2008 were re.viewed at KAMC. These charts were from Saudi patients who were diagnosed with HF, with and without subsequent stroke. Demographics, HF characteristics, stroke risk factors, and metabolic characteristics were noted and analyzed.No difference was observed in HF characteristics and stroke risk factors among HF patients with and without subsequent stroke. In terms of metabolic profile, those who had stroke had significantly higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL)--cholesterol levels as compared to those without (P=.03). Stratification to gender and adjusting for age and risk factors revealed that significantly higher LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol levels were observed in female stroke patients (P values .02, .028, respectively) and significantly higher blood urea nitrogen levels were observed in male stroke patients (P=.04) as compared to their counterparts who never had a stroke.The gender differences in the metabolic presentation of Saudi HF patients with stroke warrant further clinical investigation. Atherogenic dyslipidemia and renal insufficiency are suggested to be early predic.tors for stroke and should be closely monitored in Saudi HF patients."Stroke	REVIEW	"Stroke is a leading cause of permanent disability and death. A complex series of biochemical and molecular mechanisms (e.g. the release of ROS/NOS, proapoptotic proteins and proinflammatory cytokine; neuronal depolarization, Ca2+ accumulation and so on) impair the neurologic functions of cerebral ischemia and stroke. We have known for some time that the epidemiology of human stroke is sexually dimorphic until late in life, well beyond the years of reproductive senescence and menopause. The principal mammalian estrogen (17ë_ estradiol or E2) is neuroprotective in many types of brain injury and has been the major focus of investigation over the past several decades. However the incidence of stroke in women is lower than in men until decades past menopause, suggesting that factors beyond sex hormone contribute to these epidemiological sex differences. So a new concept is emerging: both sex steroids and biologic sex are important factors in clinical and experimental strokes. In this review, we will address sex steroids and gender differences in influencing the mechanisms and outcomes of brain ischemia stroke. These sex differences need to be identified which could help future translation to human neuroprotection."Stroke	REVIEW	"In recent years, there were great controversies about gender disparities in stroke outcome. The study was aimed to investigate sex differences in stroke case fatality on all published studies based in a comprehensive meta-analysis.A systematic search of Pubmed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was conducted for the included papers between 1992 and 2009. For the pooled group and subgroup analysis, fixed effects or random effects model were used to find sex differences in case fatality of stroke with a Mantel-Haenszel method. Meta-regression analysis was performed to study methodological heterogeneity.Thirty-six population-based studies, together with three randomized clinical trials (RCTs), were included in the present study. For the pooled group, there was an overall hazard risk of 1.13 for women compared with men. A hazard risk of 1.27 was observed for women in RCTs subgroup and 1.12 for women in population-based subgroup. The regression analysis found no significant correlation between methodological variables and heterogeneity.Due to the limited data about sex differences in stroke case fatality, the findings should be treated cautiously as preliminary. More large multicenter clinical trials should be performed to verify the reliability of the results."Stroke	EPI	"Our aim was to prospectively ascertain the incidence of first-ever stroke and ischaemic stroke subtypes, mortality, functional outcome and recurrence in northern Italy. We identified all possible cases of stroke (1st January 2004 and 31st December 2008). Multiple overlapping sources were used. Standard definitions for incident cases, pathological types and infarction subtypes were used. Patient characteristics were identified and analysed, case-fatality was ascertained from administrative databases, and outcome was assessed in all surviving patients by modified Rankin Scale. We identified 1,326 incident strokes. The pathological diagnosis was confirmed in 94% of cases. The incidence of first-ever stroke was 80.2 per 100,000 (95% CI 73-87) when adjusted to world population. The incidence of embolic stroke was significantly greater in women than in men (p < 0.001) whereas the incidence of atherothrombotic stroke was significantly greater in men than in women (p < 0.001). The case-fatality of incident strokes was 9.5% at 7 day, 16.1% at 28 day, and 29.9% at 1 year. Case-fatality of ischaemic stroke was lower than that of other pathological types (p < 0.0001). Hypertension was the most important risk factor, and atrial fibrillation was the most common in embolic stroke. Increasing age, female gender and embolic stroke subtypes were associated with an adverse outcome. Data on stroke incidence and case-fatality were similar to those of other high-income countries. However, differences were found in the distribution of risk factors and prognosis across the stroke types and ischaemic stroke subtypes. Gender differences in long-term functional outcomes were significant."Stroke	Outcomes	"We aimed to investigate the effect of gender difference on the accessibility to emergency care, hospital mortality and disability in acute stroke care.This study was performed on a single-tiered basic emergency medical service with a comprehensive national health insurance. Demographic variables, risk factors, elapsed time intervals, performing diagnosis and treatment options, hospital mortality, and modified Rankin Scale of acute ischemic stroke during 2008 were collected. We modeled the multivariate regression analysis for gender differences on the accessibility, hospital mortality, and disability. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated adjusting for potential risk factors.The total number of patients was 6635. The time from symptom onset to emergency department (ED) arrival and to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan and from ED arrival to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan was significantly longer in women. No significant difference was found in either the time to intravenous thrombolysis or in the number of patients who received intravenous thrombolysis, anti-platelet therapy, anti-coagulation, or operation. The hospital mortality rate was higher in women (3.9%) than in men (2.9%) (P = .03). The increased disability was significantly higher in women (67.8%) than in men (65.1%) (P = .02). The hospital mortality and increased disability showed a non-significant difference between the 2 genders in the adjusted model (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.74-1.64) and (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.96-1.28), respectively.The adjusted model for risk factors showed no significant difference on hospital mortality and disability between the 2 genders for stroke patients."Stroke	Management	"The prevalence of AF is higher in men and increases with age. However, the number of elderly women is higher than that of elderly men, and AF should be considered to affect men and women equally. Little information exists on elderly AF patients, and in particular, whether stroke and bleeding risk differs between elderly women and elderly men remains unknown.We have performed the EPICA Study, a large, multicentre observational study including 4093 elderly patients who started VKA treatment after the age of 80years. In this study, we will focus our analysis on 3015 AF patients followed for 7620 patient-years (pt-yrs) to evaluate if bleeding and stroke risks were different between genders.During follow-up, we recorded 112 ischemic cerebral events (rate 1.5 ÌÑ100pt-years) with no difference between genders. History of previous stroke/TIA, hypertension and artery vascular disease are independently associated with stroke/TIA during treatment. We recorded 132 major bleeds (rate 1.7 ÌÑ100pt-years); males showed a higher risk of bleeding (OR 1.5), even if not statistically significant. At multivariate analysis, history of major bleeds, history of falls and active cancer are risk factors independently associated to bleeding.Elderly patients with AF do not show clear gender related differences in the risk of major adverse events. However, elderly males showed a higher rate of bleeding complications, and females showed a slightly higher rate of stroke, thus suggesting the possibility of a higher net clinical benefit of anticoagulant treatment in females."Stroke	EPI	"Gender distribution of acute stroke patients varies considerably among stroke registries throughout the world, but factors responsible for this phenomenon remained vastly unknown.Using data from prospective hospital-based stroke registries in China (n = 752 acute stroke patients), Germany (n = 96054), India (n = 1500), and Iran (n = 1392), this descriptive study explored gender distribution of stroke patients and its determinants. In addition, the proportions of males and females to be expected in fictive study populations were calculated, and differences in gender distribution between stroke databases throughout the world were described.In the German dataset, a maximum male preponderance was found for patients aged between 55 and 64 years (proportion of male patients 0.67 [95% CI: 0.66-0.67]), whereas patients older than 84 years revealed a strong overbalance of females (0.27 [0.26-0.28]). In Germany, age-specific gender distribution of stroke patients is well explained by the numbers of females and males in the general population and by gender-specific stroke incidence rates. Both in China and India, a strong preponderance of male stroke patients was found for the majority of age categories with a maximum proportion of male patients of 0.82 in the 35-44 years age group. In contrast, the Iranian stroke register revealed an overbalance of females (0.13 [0.11-0.14]) in nearly all age categories. A total of 1392 Iranian ischemic stroke patients (738 female, 654 male) were investigated.Gender distribution of acute stroke patients is highly variable. Gender distribution varied considerably between countries. Apart from demographic factors reflecting gender ratio in the general population and gender-specific stroke incidence rates, sociocultural peculiarities may also play an important role in this context."Stroke	CLIN	"This study aimed to investigate the association between atrophy in the prefrontal cortex with executive function and verbal fluency in elderly male and female patients poststroke. Thirty elderly female patients with non-aphasic ischemic stroke aged ‰ä´ 60 years and 30 age-matched non-aphasic male patients with ischemic stroke were recruited. Automatic magnetic resonance imaging segmentation was used to assess the volume of the whole prefrontal cortex, along with its subdivisions: anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The Semantic Verbal Fluency Test was administered at 3 and 15 months poststroke. At 3 months poststroke, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume was significantly correlated with Verbal Fluency Test score in female patients only (partial coefficient = 0.453, P = 0.045), after controlling for age, education, diabetes, neurological deficit, white matter lesions volume, as well as the location and volume of infarcts. At 15 months poststroke, there remained a significant association between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume and Verbal Fluency Test (partial coefficient = 0.661, P = 0.001) and between the left prefrontal cortex volume and Verbal Fluency Test (partial coefficient = 0.573, P = 0.004) in female patients after the same adjustments. These findings indicate that atrophy of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex contributes to the impairment of verbal fluency in elderly female patients with stroke. Sex differences may be present in the neuropsychological mechanisms of verbal fluency impairment in patients with stroke. "Stroke	Outcomes	"Women have worse outcomes after stroke compared to men. Since women have lower hemoglobin values, we examined whether hemoglobin levels may associate with worse stroke outcomes in women.We retrospectively studied 274 patients enrolled in a prospective multicenter study. We explored the relationship of hemoglobin with clinical outcome at 6 months, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Ordinal logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent effect of hemoglobin on clinical outcome, and to explore the influence of sex on that association.Women had a lower mean hemoglobin level (11.7 å± 1.8 g/dL) compared to men (13.3 å± 1.7 g/dL). Low hemoglobin was associated with worse 6-month mRS outcomes in univariate analysis (p < 0.001). Lower hemoglobin remained independently associated with poor outcome after adjustment for comorbid disease, stroke severity, age, and sex. The inclusion of hemoglobin in the model attenuated the independent effect of sex on outcome.Sex differences in stroke outcome are linked to lower hemoglobin level, which is more prevalent in women. Further examination of this potentially modifiable predictor is warranted."Stroke	Review	"Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the primary cause of disability in the developed world. Experimental and clinical data indicate that stroke is a sexually dimorphic disease, with males demonstrating an enhanced intrinsic sensitivity to ischemic damage throughout most of their lifespan. The neuroprotective role of estrogen in the female brain is well established, however, estrogen exposure can also be deleterious, especially in older women. The mechanisms for this remain unclear. Our current understanding is based on studies examining estrogen as it relates to neuronal injury, yet cerebral ischemia also induces a robust sterile inflammatory response involving local and systemic immune cells. Despite the potent anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen, few studies have investigated the contribution of estrogen to sex differences in the inflammatory response to stroke. This review examines the potential role for estrogen-mediated immunoprotection in ischemic injury."Stroke	CLIN	"Available data are inconsistent regarding factors influencing plasma cholesterol homeostasis marker concentrations and their value in predicting subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.To address this issue, the relationship between markers of cholesterol absorption (campesterol, sitosterol, cholestanol) and synthesis (squalene, desmosterol, lathosterol) and 10-year CVD incidence was assessed in Framingham Offspring Study participants (cycle 6) who were without CVD at baseline and not taking lipid-lowering medications (N=2616). The primary end point was ""hard"" coronary heart disease (HCHD; coronary death and myocardial infarction), and the secondary end point was full CVD (HCHD plus stroke, coronary insufficiency, angina pectoris, peripheral artery disease, and congestive heart failure). In cross-sectional analysis, significant differences by sex, age, body mass index, blood pressure, and smoking status were observed. In both women and men, lower cholesterol absorption was associated with higher triglyceride and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations, whereas lower cholesterol synthesis was associated with higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations (P for trend <0.05). In women only, lower cholesterol synthesis and absorption were associated with higher non-HDL cholesterol concentrations. Using Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for standard CVD risk factors, squalene concentrations were associated with lower HCHD in women (hazard ratio=0.70 [0.5 to 0.9]). In contrast, squalene (hazard ratio=1.40 [1.1 to 1.8]) concentrations were associated with higher HCHD in men (P<0.0001 for interaction). The cholesterol absorption markers were not predictive of HCHD or full CVD in either women or men.These data suggest significant sex differences in the 10-year prognostic value of cholesterol synthesis markers and HCHD, specifically coronary death and incidence of myocardial infarction."Stroke	OUTC	"Women are more likely to have a worse outcome after an acute stroke than men. Some studies have suggested that women also benefit less from intravenous thrombolysis after an acute ischemic stroke, but others found no sex differences in safety and efficacy. We aimed to evaluate differences in 3-month outcome between sexes in intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator-treated patients registered in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register.A total of 45 079 patients treated with intravenous alteplase were recorded from 2002 to 2011. Main outcome measures were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2), and mortality at 3 months.Among 25 777 (57.2%) men and 19 302 (42.8%) women, we found no difference in the rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (P=0.13), a significantly higher likelihood of functional independence at 3 months in men (P<0.0001) and a higher mortality in women when compared with men (P<0.00001). After adjustment for confounding variables, we did not observe any difference between sexes in functional outcome (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.09; P=0.39), whereas male sex was related to a higher risk of mortality (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.29; P=0.00003) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (odds ratio, 1.25, 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.51; P=0.02).Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men."Stroke	OUTC	"We compared the illness narratives of 9 male and 9 female United Kingdom stroke survivors using Frank's typologies of illness narratives. Most respondents presented a single dominant narrative genre (""quest memoir,"" ""restitution,"" ""chaos,"" or a new ""despair"" genre); none presented quest manifesto or automythology narratives of social action or self-reinvention. We found no gender differences apparent in which genres respondents presented. Stroke severity and the degree of anticipated or actual recovery largely influenced which genre predominated in individual accounts. Contrary to some sociological understandings of gender and health, gender appeared to be less influential on stroke survivors' illness accounts than aspects of the illness, such as its severity. "Stroke	EPI	"Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide and a major contributor to global disease burden. Although epidemiologic information from a community perspective is important in determining the magnitude of the burden in specific regions, and directing equitable distribution of health resources, data on the incidence of stroke in developing countries in Africa are scarce.To determine the current incidence rate and short-term (30-day) case fatality rate (CFR) of stroke in urban Nigeria, and provide age-adjusted and gender-specific incidence rates to enable comparison with global populations.The study was a prospective community-based stroke registry enrolling hospitalized and non-hospitalized first-ever in a lifetime stroke cases presenting at all health facilities (hospitals, homeopathic caregivers, physiotherapy clinics) located in the designated community. Pre-hospitalization deaths due to stroke were not included in our study. The study was conducted between January 1st and December 31st 2007 in Surulere Local Government Area of Lagos State, south western Nigeria, a mixed-income urban locality with a population of approximately 750,000 based on data from the National Population Commission. Stroke was defined using the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical criteria. Case fatality at 30-days post stroke was determined at follow-up on 160 hospitalized stroke cases.189 first-ever strokes, comprised of 112 men and 77 women (meanå±SD age 58.5å±13.5 years) were documented, giving a crude incidence rate of 25.2 per 100,000 per year (95% confidence interval 21.6- 28.8). The gender-specific rates were 28.3/100,000 and 21.3/100,000 for males and females respectively. The age-adjusted incidence rate was 54.08 per 100,000 per year (adjusted to the WHO New World Population). Hospitalization rate was 84.6%, while the CFR (hospitalized) was 16.2%.The stroke incidence in this urban sub-Saharan African community remains lower than that in emerging and developed economies, although the age- and gender-related trends and CFR are comparable to that in developed countries."Stroke	REVIEW	"Stroke, the number four cause of death in the United States, is a greatly debilitating event resulting from insufficient blood supply to the brain (cerebral ischemia). Endothelial dysfunction, primarily characterized by dampened endothelial- dependent vasodilation, is a major contributor to the development and outcome of stroke. This review discusses the role of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), an enzyme responsible for the degradation of vasoprotective eicosatrienoic acids (EETs), in the context of the cerebral vasculature and its contribution to the sexual dimorphic nature of stroke. "Stroke	REVIEW	"Cerebrovascular disease is a leading cause of death-from-disease and of disability worldwide, affecting some 15 million people. The incidence of stroke or ""brain attack"" is unlikely to recede for a decade at minimum by most predictions, despite large public health initiatives in stroke prevention. It has been well established that stroke is also one of the most strikingly sex-specific diseases in its epidemiology, and in some cases, in patient outcomes. For example, women sustain lower rates of ischemic stroke relative to men, even beyond their menopausal years. In contrast, outcomes are worse in women in many clinical studies. The biological basis for this sexual dimorphism is a compelling story, and both hormone-dependent and hormone-independent factors are involved, the latter of which is the subject of this brief review. Understanding the molecular and cell-based mechanisms underlying sex differences in ischemic brain injury is an important step toward personalized medicine and effective therapeutic interventions in patients of both sexes. "Stroke	EPI	"Geographic variation and sex difference in the distribution of intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) have not been fully discussed before in Chinese patients with cerebral ischemia. We performed this study with the aim to investigate geographic and sex difference in the distribution of ICAS in China.In this prospective multicenter study, we evaluated 2864 consecutive patients who experienced an acute cerebral ischemia within 7 days of symptom onset in 22 hospitals in China. All the inclusive patients underwent 3-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography and duplex color Doppler ultrasound or contrast-enhanced MR angiography to document the presence of intracranial or extracranial stenosis. Intracranial large-artery atherosclerosis was defined as ‰ä´50% diameter reduction on MR angiography.The proportion of patients with ICAS was significantly higher in north China than in south China (50.22% versus 41.88%; P<0.0001). Patients in the north were likely to consume more alcohol and smoke more cigarettes and had significantly higher proportion of diabetes mellitus, family history of stroke, history of cerebral ischemia, heart disease, and higher body mass index. In patients aged >63 years, the percentage of ICAS in women was notably higher than in men (51.51% versus 45.40%; P=0.028). In elderly patients, women had higher proportion of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and heart disease than men.There exists geographic and sex difference in the distribution of symptomatic ICAS in China. Public health measures should strengthen improving social determinants of health and risk factor prevention/control in high-risk populations for decreasing stroke risk."Stroke	Outcomes	"Previous reports have shown inconsistent results on clinical outcomes between women and men after stroke, and little is known about gender differences on outcomes in Chinese post-stroke patients. The aim of this study was to explore whether there were gender differences on clinical characteristics and outcomes in Chinese patients after ischemic stroke by using the data from the China National Stroke Registry (CNSR).Out of 12,415 consecutively recruited patients with acute ischemic stroke in the CNSR from 2007 to 2008, 11,560 (93.1%) patients were followed up for 12 months. Their clinical characteristics and outcomes on death, recurrence, and dependency were recorded. The multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine whether there were gender differences in these outcomes. Women were older than men at baseline (67.9 vs. 64.0 years, P<0.001). Women had a higher mortality, recurrence rate, and dependency rate at 3, 6, and 12 months than men, but after adjusting for age, history of diabetes, pre-stroke dependency, stroke severity, in-hospital complications, and other confounders, there were no statistically significant differences in gender on mortality and recurrence rate at 3, 6, and 12 months; and dependency rate at 3, and 6 months. However, the dependency rate at 12 months remained significantly higher in women (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.45).There are many differences in clinical characteristics between women and men after ischemic stroke in China. Compared with men, women are more dependent at 12 months after stroke. This difference still exists after controlling the potential confounders."Stroke	PP	"Men have a higher stroke incidence compared to women until advanced age. The contribution of hormones to these sex differences has been extensively debated. In experimental stroke, estradiol is neuroprotective, whereas androgens are detrimental. However, prior studies have only examined the effects of acute treatment paradigms; therefore, the timing and mechanism by which ischemic sexual dimorphism arises are unknown.The effects of exogenous neonatal androgen exposure on subsequent injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in adulthood in male rats were examined. Rats were administered vehicle (oil), testosterone propionate (TP) or the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 5 days after birth. At 3 months of age, a focal stroke was induced.Testosterone-treated rats (but not DHT-treated animals) had decreased infarct volumes (20 vs. 33%, p < 0.05) as well as increased estradiol levels (39.4 vs. 18.6 pg/ml, p < 0.0001) compared to oil-treated animals. TP-injected males had increased testicular aromatase (P450arom) levels (3.6 vs. 0.2 ng/ml, p < 0.0001) compared to oil-treated males. The level of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, the primary endogenous inhibitor of caspase-induced apoptosis, was increased in TP-treated rats compared with the oil-treated males.Neonatal exposure to exogenous testosterone upregulates testicular aromatase expression in male rats and leads to adult neuroprotection secondary to changes in serum estradiol levels and cell death proteins. This study suggests that early exposure to gonadal hormones can have dramatic effects on the response to adult cerebrovascular injury."Stroke	PP	"Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (sEH) is a key enzyme in the metabolism and termination of action of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, derivatives of arachidonic acid, which are protective against ischemic stroke. Mice lacking sEH globally are protected from injury following stroke; however, little is known about the role of endothelial sEH in brain ischemia. We generated transgenic mice with endothelial-specific expression of human sEH (Tie2-hsEH), and assessed the effect of transgenic overexpression of endothelial sEH on endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity and ischemic injury following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Compared to wild-type, male Tie2-hsEH mice exhibited impaired vasodilation in response to stimulation with 1 åµM acetylcholine as assessed by laser-Doppler perfusion monitoring in an in-vivo cranial window preparation. No difference in infarct size was observed between wild-type and Tie2-hsEH male mice. In females, however, Tie2-hsEH mice sustained larger infarcts in striatum, but not cortex, compared to wild-type mice. Sex difference in ischemic injury was maintained in the cortex of Tie2-hsEH mice. In the striatum, expression of Tie2-hsEH resulted in a sex difference, with larger infarct in females than males. These findings demonstrate that transgenic expression of sEH in endothelium results in impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the cerebral circulation, and that females are more susceptible to enhanced ischemic damage as a result of increased endothelial sEH than males, especially in end-arteriolar striatal region."Stroke	PP	"Male-female differences may significantly impact stroke prevention and treatment in men and women, however underlying mechanisms for sexual dimorphism in stroke are not understood. We previously found in males that cerebral ischemia upregulates contractile receptors in cerebral arteries, which is associated with lower blood flow. The present study investigates if cerebral arteries from men and women differ in cerebrovascular receptor upregulation.Freshly obtained human cerebral arteries were placed in organ culture, an established model for studying receptor upregulation. 5-hydroxtryptamine type 1B (5-HT1B), angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) and endothelin-1 type A and B (ETA and ETB) receptors were evaluated using wire myograph for contractile responses, real-time PCR for mRNA and immunohistochemistry for receptor expression.Vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II and endothelin-1 was markedly lower in cultured cerebral arteries from women as compared to men. ETB receptor-mediated contraction occurred in male but not female arteries. Interestingly, there were similar upregulation in mRNA and expression of 5-HT1B, AT1, and ETB receptors and in local expression of Ang II after organ culture.In spite of receptor upregulation after organ culture in both sexes, cerebral arteries from women were significantly less responsive to vasoconstrictors angiotensin II and endothelin-1 as compared to arteries from men. This suggests receptor coupling and/or signal transduction mechanisms involved in cerebrovascular contractility may be suppressed in females. This is the first study to demonstrate sex differences in the vascular function of human brain arteries."Stroke	EPI	"Most previous studies of meat intake and total or cause-specific mortality were conducted in North America, whereas studies in other areas have been limited and reported inconsistent results. This study investigated the association of red meat or poultry intake with risk of total and cause-specific mortality, including cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD), in two large population-based prospective cohort studies of 134,290 Chinese adult women and men in Shanghai. Meat intakes were assessed through validated food frequency questionnaires administered in person at baseline. Vital status and dates and causes of deaths were ascertained through annual linkage to the Shanghai Vital Statistics Registry and Shanghai Cancer Registry databases and home visits every 2-3 years. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of death associated with quintiles of meat intake. During 803,265 person-years of follow up for women and 334,281 person-years of follow up for men, a total of 4,210 deaths in women and 2,733 deaths in men accrued. The median intakes of red meat were 43 g/day among women and 54 g/day among men, and pork constituted at least 95% of total meat intake for both women and men. Red meat intake was associated with increased total mortality among men, but not among women; the HR (95% CI) comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles were 1.18 (1.02-1.35) and 0.92 (0.82-1.03), respectively. This sex difference was statistically significant (P‰Û_=‰Û_0.01). Red meat intake was associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease mortality (HR‰Û_=‰Û_1.41, 95% CI‰Û_=‰Û_1.05-1.89) and with decreased risk of hemorrhagic stroke mortality (HR‰Û_=‰Û_0.62, 95% CI‰Û_=‰Û_0.45-0.87). There were suggestive inverse associations of poultry intake with risk of total and all-CVD mortality among men, but not among women. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the sex-specific associations between red meat intake and mortality."Stroke	CLIN	Clinical manifestation and platelet homeostasis parameter results in elderly patients with atherothrombotic and lacunar strokes are presented. There is platelet activation in these patients manifested by increasing of P-selectin expression in response to adenosindiphosphate induction on flow-cytometry. Agregometry method was not informative for platelet activity estimation in these patients. Von Willebrand factor receptor expression on the platelet may have prognostic value for acute period. The fibrinogen receptor expression on the platelet was increased in women with stroke comparing with men.Stroke	OUTC	"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a common and devastating form of cerebrovascular disease. In ICH, gender differences in outcomes remain relatively understudied but have been examined in other neurological emergencies. Further, a potential effect of age and gender on outcomes after ICH has not been explored. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that age and gender interact to modify neurological outcomes after ICH.Adult patients admitted with spontaneous primary supratentorial ICH from July 2007 through April 2010 were assessed via retrospective analysis of an existing stroke database at Duke University. Univariate analysis of collected variables was used to compare gender and outcome. Unfavorable outcome was defined as discharge to hospice or death. Using multivariate regression, the combined effect of age and gender on outcome after ICH was analyzed.In this study population, women were younger (61.1+14.5 versus 65.8+17.3 years, p=0.03) and more likely to have a history of substance abuse (35% versus 8.9%, p<0.0001) compared to men. Multivariable models demonstrated that advancing age had a greater effect on predicting discharge outcome in women compared to men (p=0.02). For younger patients, female sex was protective; however, at ages greater than 60 years, female sex was a risk factor for discharge to hospice or death.While independently associated with discharge to hospice or death after ICH, the interaction effect between gender and age demonstrated significantly stronger correlation with early outcome after ICH in a single center cohort. Prospective study is required to verify these findings."Stroke	OUTC	"Post-stroke depression (PSD) is commonly observed among stroke survivors. However, statistical analysis of such data is scarce in developing countries. The purpose of this study is to examine the incidence of PSD and its relationship with stroke characteristics in China.This was a prospective hospital-based study. Stroke patients were assessed within two weeks after acute ischemic stroke onset and then reevaluated at three months. Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) was used for screening depression (PSD). Subjects with HAMD score of ‰ä´7 were further assessed with the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Stroke severity was measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Stroke outcome was measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).One hundred and two stroke patients were recruited, only ninety-one patients completed del period (men‰Û_=‰Û_53, 63.74%), with mean age 60.0å±10.4 years (range, 34-82 years). The incidence of PSD was 27.47% two weeks after stroke. The occurrence of PSD was unrelated with age, stroke type, stroke lesion and the history of disease. In univariate analysis gender, PSD was correlated with female gender. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, poor stroke outcome (mRS‰ä´3) (OR 12.113, CI 1.169 to 125.59, P<0.05) was the important predictors of PSD.The study indicated that gender, functional dependence and stroke outcome are determinants of PSD occurrence during the first 2 weeks after stroke in China."Stroke	EPI	"The role of serum uric acid as an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease and death is uncertain in the general population. Adjustments for additional cardiovascular risk factors have not been consistent. We examined the association of serum uric acid with all-cause mortality, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction in a prospective population based study, with several traditional and non-traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease included in the model.A population-based prospective cohort study was performed among 2696 men and 3004 women. Endpoints were all-cause mortality after 15 years, and fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke after 12 years.1433 deaths, 659 MIs and 430 ischemic strokes occurred during follow-up. Fully adjusted Cox regression analyses showed that per 1 SD (87 ë_mol/L) increase in serum uric acid level, the risk of all-cause mortality increased in both genders (hazard ratios, HR men; 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.20, women; 1.16, 1.05-1.29). HRs and 95% CI for stroke were 1.31, 1.14-1.50 in men, 1.13, 0.94-1.36 in women, and 1.22 (1.09, 1.35) in the overall population. No independent associations were observed with MI.Serum uric acid was associated with all-cause mortality in men and women, even after adjustment for blood pressure, estimated GFR, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, drug intake and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. After the same adjustments, serum uric acid was associated with 31% increased risk of stroke in men."Stroke	EPI	"To estimate age- and gender-specific incidence rates among Greenlandic stroke-survivors.The study was performed as a cross-sectional observational study.All Greenlandic patients admitted to Queen Ingrid's Hospital (QIH) with stroke in 2011 and 2012 were included in the study. Data were obtained from patient files and the Central Civil Registration System. Age- and gender-specific incidence rates were estimated as cases/100,000 adults/year. Direct age-standardized incidence rate was calculated using the WHO 2000-2005 population as the standard.In 2011 and 2012, 156 cases of stroke were registered, 72 (46.2%) males and 84 (53.8%) females. The overall incidence rate of stroke was 155/100,000 person-years (95% CI 121-190), with ischemic stroke accounting for 89.1% of these. No significant differences were seen between men and women. Direct age-standardized incidence rate was 149/year/100,000 (95% CI 192-264). Median age at time of diagnosis was 60 years (interquartile range 53-69).This study reports an age-standardized all-stroke incidence rate of Greenlandic stroke-survivors in Greenland within the wide range as incidences in Western Europe. A noticeable difference when compared to Denmark was that male and female incidence were approximately the same, and that incidence rates were high in the younger age groups. The majority of strokes were of ischemic origin."Stroke	EPI	"The Hajj Ceremony, the largest annual gathering in the world, is the most important life event for any Muslim. This study was designed to evaluate the incidence of stroke among Iranian pilgrims during the Hajj ceremony.We ascertained all cases of stroke occurring in a population of 92,974 Iranian pilgrims between November 27, 2007 and January 12, 2008. Incidence and risk factors of the first ever stroke in Hajj pilgrims were compared, within the same time frame, to those of the Mashhad residents, the second largest city in Iran. Data for the latter group were extracted from the Mashhad Stroke Incidence Study (MSIS) database.During the study period, 17 first-ever strokes occurred in the Hajj pilgrims and 40 first-ever stroke strokes occurred in the MSIS group. Overall, the adjusted incidence rate of first ever stroke in the Hajj cohort was lower than that of the MSIS population (9 vs. 16 per 100,000). For age- and gender-specific subgroups, the Hajj stroke crude rates were in general similar to or lower than the general population of Mashhad, Iran, with the exception of women aged 35 to 44åÊyears and aged >75åÊyears who were at greater risk of having first-ever stroke than the non-pilgrims of the same age.The first ever stroke rate among Iranian Hajj pilgrims was lower than that of the general population in Mashhad, Iran, except for females 35-44 or more than 75åÊyears old. The number of events occurring during the Hajj suggests that Islamic countries should consider designing preventive and screening programs for pilgrims."Stroke	CLIN	"External common carotid artery (CCA) diameter and intima-media thickness (IMT) are independently associated with incident stroke and other cardiovascular events. Arterial geometry such as large IMT and large diameter may reflect vulnerable plaques and so impact stroke risk. Finally, arterial changes that exist bilaterally may increase stroke risk.We studied middle-aged men and women (n=7276) from a prospective observational study who had right (R) and left (L) CCA IMT and external diameters measured via B-mode ultrasound (1987-89) in order to categorize CCA geometry. Using side- and gender-specific IMT and diameter medians, we categorized each measurement as large (‰ä´ median) vs. not large (< median) and defined four geometries: both IMT and diameter were large, only one parameter was large, or neither was large (reference group). Participants were followed for first time stroke through December 31, 1999. We used proportional hazards models to assess associations between right and left CCA geometries with new stroke. We also calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios (+LR and -LR) for CCA bilateral phenotypes as a measure of diagnostic accuracy.Presence of both large CCA IMT and large diameter on one side was associated with strong stroke risk even after risk factor adjustment (men: RCCA hazard ratio [HR]=3.7 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.9-7.4; LCCA HR=2.4 95% CI=1.4-4.4; women: RCCA HR=4.0 95% CI=1.5-10.5; LCCA HR=5.7 95% CI=1.7-19.0). Presence of both large IMT and large diameter bilaterally was the strongest predictor of stroke identifying 64% of women and 44% of men who developed strokes. This phenotype showed potential for predicting stroke among individuals (women: +LR=3.1, 95% CI=2.6-3.8; men: +LR=2.3, 95% CI=1.8-2.8).Bilateral carotid artery geometries may be useful for stroke risk prediction."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Stroke risk and outcome are different in men and women. We hypothesized that this is partly due to an inherent difference in susceptibility to ischemia between neurons from male vs. female brains. We tested whether neurons from male rodents are more susceptible to in-vitro ischemia than cells from females, and if this is related to increased expression of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). sEH contributes to neuronal cell death by inactivating neuroprotective epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs).Rodent cortical neurons were cultured, and exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD); then cell death was measured. EETs levels were determined by LC-MS/MS. Expression of sEH-encoding ephx2 was determined by qRT-PCR. Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and hydrolase activity assay assessed protein expression and activity.Cell death after OGD was higher in neurons from males vs. females, which correlated with higher ephx2 mRNA and stronger sEH immunoreactivity. However, EETs levels were similar in both sexes and pharmacological inhibition of the hydrolase domain of sEH did not abolish the sex difference in cell death. Genetic knockout of sEH in mice abolished the sex difference observed in neurons isolated from these mice after OGD.Cultured cortical neurons from females are more resistant to ischemia than neurons from males. Neurons from females have less sEH activity compared to neurons from males at baseline, although sEH levels were not measured after OGD. While pharmacological inhibition of the hydrolase domain of sEH does not affect cell death, knockout of the gene encoding sEH eradicates the sex difference seen in wild-type neurons, suggesting a role for further study of the lesser-known phosphatase domain of sEH and its role in sexual dimorphism in neuronal sensitivity to ischemia."Stroke	Review	"To determine any sex differences in age-specific prevalence or severity of leukoaraiosis, a marker of white matter ischemia, in population-based and clinic cohorts of TIA/stroke and in a systematic review of the literature.Age-specific sex differences were calculated for both CT and MRI in the Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC) and in an MRI-based clinic cohort. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) for leukoaraiosis in women vs men from published studies by fixed-effect meta-analysis, stratified by patient characteristics (stroke vs nonstroke) and CT vs MRI.Among 10 stroke studies (all CT-based), leukoaraiosis was most frequent in women (OR = 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-1.57, p < 0.0001), with little heterogeneity between studies (p = 0.28). However, no such excess was seen in 10 reports of nonstroke cohorts (0.91, 0.67-1.24, p = 0.56). Moreover, excess leukoaraiosis in women on CT-imaging in OXVASC (1.38, 1.15-1.67, p = 0.001) was explained by their older age (age-adjusted OR = 1.01, 0.82-1.25, p = 0.90). Leukoaraiosis was more severe in older (‰ä´ 75) women (CT-1.50, 1.14-1.97, p = 0.004 in OXVASC; MRI-1.70, 1.17-2.48, p = 0.006 in OXVASC and clinic cohort). However, leukoaraiosis was independently associated with early mortality (hazard ratio = 1.46, 1.23-1.73, p < 0.0001), suggesting that comparisons in older age groups will be biased by prior premature death of men with leukoaraiosis. Sex differences in severity of leukoaraiosis were not addressed in previous studies.Previously reported excess leukoaraiosis in women with TIA/stroke is likely to be confounded by age and apparently greater severity in older women is likely to be biased by premature death in men with leukoaraiosis."Stroke	Outcomes	"Moyamoya (MM) disease is an idiopathic steno-occlusive angiopathy occurring more frequently in females.To evaluate sex differences in preoperative symptoms and treatment outcomes after revascularization surgery.We analyzed 430 MM disease patients undergoing 717 revascularization procedures spanning 19 years (1991-2010) and compared gender differences in preoperative symptoms and long-term outcomes after surgical revascularization.A total of 307 female and 123 male patients (ratio, 2.5:1) with a mean age of 31.0 å± 16.7 years and adults-to-children ratio of 2.5:1 underwent 717 revascularization procedures. Female patients were more likely to experience preoperative transient ischemic attacks (odds ratio: 2.1, P = .001) and less likely to receive a diagnosis of unilateral MM disease (odds ratio: 0.6, P = .04). No association was observed between sex and risk of preoperative ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. There was no difference in neurological outcome because both male and female patients experienced significant improvement in the modified Rankin Scale score after surgery (P < .0001). On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, 5-year cumulative risk of adverse postoperative events despite successful revascularization was 11.4% in female vs 5.3% in male patients (P = .05). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, female sex trended toward an association with adverse postoperative events (hazard ratio: 1.9, P = .14).Female patients are more susceptible to the development of preoperative transient ischemic attack and may be at higher risk of adverse postoperative events despite successful revascularization. There is, however, no sex difference in neurological outcome because patients of both sexes experience significant improvement in neurological status with low risk of the development of future ischemic events after surgical revascularization."Stroke	Management	"This observational study describes the sex differences in the use of secondary preventive drugs after ischemic stroke in terms of prescribing and persistence. Also, sex differences in patient- and treatment-related factors associated with drug use were investigated.In this nationwide register-based study, the Swedish Stroke Register was linked to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register for information on drugs prescribed for, and bought by, stroke patients. Background factors were included from the Swedish Stroke Register.Included in the database were 9331 men and 9018 women. Men were more often prescribed statins, 48.8% versus 38.1% [age-adjusted prevalence ratio (PR)‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.86, 95%CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.82-0.91], and warfarin, 38.4% versus 26.4% after stroke (age-adjusted PR‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.88, 95%CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.79-0.97). There were no differences in prescribing of antihypertensive or antiplatelet drugs. No sex differences were seen regarding not continuing drug treatment after discharge (primary non-adherence). Women had slightly higher persistence to antihypertensive treatment 2‰Ûäyears after discharge, 76.3% versus 71.9% for men (age-adjusted PR‰Ûä=‰Ûä1.05, 95%CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä1.00-1.09), but there were no differences in persistence to antiplatelet, warfarin or statin treatments. Similar factors were related to statin and warfarin prescribing for both men and women. Only antihypertensive treatment before stroke was associated to persistence to antihypertensive treatment, and this increased persistence for both men and women.This study showed few differences between men and women after stroke. Patients' use of secondary preventive drugs needs to be improved, and from a public health perspective, poor persistence is probably a greater problem than differences between the sexes."Stroke	Epidemiology	"The association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and different subtypes of stroke is unclear, and previous studies have yielded conflicting results. We aimed to assess the impact of CKD on the risk of fatal or non-fatal ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in both men and women.In 539,287 Swedish men and women, mainly undergoing health controls, with mean age 45 years, and no previous stroke or myocardial infarction, hazard ratios for stroke were calculated to assess the association between renal dysfunction and incidence of stroke. We estimated glomerular filtration rates (GFR) using the Mayo (GFR-Mayo) formula. Glomerular filtration rate 60-90, 30-60, and 15-30 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2) was defined as mildly, moderately, and severely decreased GFR, respectively.There were 17,678 strokes, of which 72% were ischemic, 15% hemorrhagic, and 12% unspecified, during 12 years of follow-up. Hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for ischemic stroke were 1.09 (1.04-1.14) for mildly, 1.24 (1.10-1.39) for moderately, and 2.27 (1.63-3.17) for severely decreased GFR-Mayo. The corresponding figures for hemorrhagic stroke were 1.04 (0.93-1.15), 1.26 (0.96-1.64), and 2.31 (1.10-4.87). Ischemic stroke was related to all levels of decreased GFR-Mayo in both genders (P < 0.0003). Hemorrhagic stroke was only related to renal dysfunction among women; hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) 1.38 (1.14-1.66) for mildly, 1.70 (1.13-2.57) for moderately, and 3.46 (1.09-10.9) for severely decreased GFR-Mayo.Already mildly decreased GFR-Mayo increases the risk of ischemic fatal or non-fatal stroke and severely decreased GFR-Mayo the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in the general population. In gender-specific analyses ischemic stroke was related to a decreased GFR-Mayo in both genders. Hemorrhagic stroke was only related to renal dysfunction among women."Stroke	Epidemiology	"We sought to better define the impact of sex on 'in-hospital outcomes' after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or stenting (CAS).Hospital discharge databases for all carotid interventions obtained from the New York State (NYS) Department of Health, Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System between 2000 and 2009 (29,917 women, 39,771 men) were analysed. Mortality, stroke and composite event (stroke/death) were compared between procedures after matching of patients by propensity score. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was our secondary 'end' point.More than 90% of patients in both sexes were asymptomatic (27,439 women and 36,295 men). Compared to men, asymptomatic women experienced more strokes after CEA (women: 1.38%, men: 1.16%, P = 0.03) and higher AMI rates after both procedures (CEA; women: 0.75%, men: 0.51%, P = 0.0009, CAS; women: 0.96%, men: 0.28%, P = 0.01). Between procedures, symptomatic women undergoing CAS showed higher rates of mortality (CAS: 4.19%, CEA: 0.47%, P = 0.01) and combined (stroke/mortality) events (CAS: 12.09%, CEA: 6.05%, P = 0.02). In all other cohorts, no statistically significant difference was found between the procedures.Compared to CEA, CAS led to inferior in-hospital outcomes only in symptomatic women in the last decade in NYS. Men and asymptomatic women showed comparable outcomes after both procedures, whereas asymptomatic females were more prone to AMI after both interventions. These sex-associated differences should be taken into account for the treatment of carotid artery disease."Stroke	Epidemiology	"We compared among young patients with ischemic stroke the distribution of vascular risk factors among sex, age groups, and 3 distinct geographic regions in Europe.We included patients with first-ever ischemic stroke aged 15 to 49 years from existing hospital- or population-based prospective or consecutive young stroke registries involving 15 cities in 12 countries. Geographic regions were defined as northern (Finland, Norway), central (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, The Netherlands, Switzerland), and southern (Greece, Italy, Turkey) Europe. Hierarchical regression models were used for comparisons.In the study cohort (n=3944), the 3 most frequent risk factors were current smoking (48.7%), dyslipidemia (45.8%), and hypertension (35.9%). Compared with central (n=1868; median age, 43 years) and northern (n=1330; median age, 44 years) European patients, southern Europeans (n=746; median age, 41 years) were younger. No sex difference emerged between the regions, male:female ratio being 0.7 in those aged <34 years and reaching 1.7 in those aged 45 to 49 years. After accounting for confounders, no risk-factor differences emerged at the region level. Compared with females, males were older and they more frequently had dyslipidemia or coronary heart disease, or were smokers, irrespective of region. In both sexes, prevalence of family history of stroke, dyslipidemia, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and atrial fibrillation positively correlated with age across all regions.Primary preventive strategies for ischemic stroke in young adults-having high rate of modifiable risk factors-should be targeted according to sex and age at continental level."Stroke	Review	"Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide and the first cause of disability in the Western world. Over the last 20 years, antiplatelet agents have reduced overall stroke rates in primary and secondary prevention in men. However, this has not been the case for women. In this narrative review, the most widely used antiplatelet therapies for primary and secondary prevention in stroke, excluding cardioembolic stroke, will be outlined. First, the largest randomised controlled trials will be analysed as well as the enrolment percentages of women. Second, analyses on sex-interaction effects in each study will be examined. Moreover, the Authors will discuss the need to develop targeted antiplatelet therapies specifically for women. Based on current results, the most randomised clinical trials and meta-analyses on antiplatelet agents in cerebrovascular disease have not performed sub-analyses on sex-related differences and this is mainly because women were underrepresented. Despite this, antiplatelet agents are considered to be equally effective for both sexes in primary and secondary stroke prevention. Finally, aspirin is the most widely studied antiplatelet in women and has been shown to provide greater benefit for women as primary prevention of ischemic stroke without a significant increased risk in haemorrhage."Stroke	Epidemiology	"The study aims to examine the association between major depression, healthcare behaviors, and quality of life indices among adults with stroke.Data from 5869 participants with stroke in the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey were examined. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the independent association between depression status, self-care and preventive health behaviors, and quality of life indices, after accounting for relevant covariates.In multivariate models, individuals with major depression were less likely to engage in physical activity (odds ratio 0åá41; 95% confidence interval 0åá29, 0åá56) than those without major depression. Women with major depression were also less likely to have received a mammogram in the past two-years (odds ratio 0åá61; 95% confidence interval 0åá40, 0åá96 for women‰Ûä‰ä´‰Ûäage 40 and odds ratio 0åá58; 95% confidence interval 0åá36, 0åá72 for women‰Ûä‰ä´‰Ûäage 50) and a pap smear in the past three-years (odds ratio 0åá40; 95% CI 0åá22, 0åá72). In comparisons of quality of life, individuals with major depression were less likely to perceive their health as excellent/very good/good (odds ratio 0åá36; 95% confidence interval 0åá25, 0åá53), to report being satisfied with life (odds ratio 0åá13; 95% confidence interval 0åá08, 0åá20), and to report receiving needed social support (odds ratio 0åá42; 95% confidence interval 0åá28, 0åá63). Individuals who were depressed were also more likely to report one or more poor physical and poor mental health days in the past 30 days (odds ratio 4åá56; 95% confidence interval 3åá08, 6åá76 and odds ratio 10åá97; 95% confidence interval 7åá75, 15åá52, respectively).In adults with stroke, major depression is associated with decreased engagement in stroke-specific and gender-specific self-care and preventive health behaviors, as well as a broad range of quality of life indices."Stroke	Review	"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare variety of cerebro-vascular disease accounting for 0.5% of all stroke. It can occur at any age. It has a 3/1 female preponderance with a peak in young women due to gender specific risk factors, especially oral contraceptives and to lesser extent pregnancy, post-partum, and in vitro fertilization. Despite a wide variety of clinical presentations, early diagnosis, mostly based on MRI/MRA, is crucial but often difficult particularly during post-partum because of the numerous causes of headache that may occur after delivery. Antithrombotic treatment based on low molecular weight heparin and symptomatic treatment should be started as rapidly as possible. The overall prognosis of CVT is much better than that of arterial stroke and it is even better in women with gender specific risk factors, with a complete recovery in 80% of patients. Future pregnancy is not contra-indicated, but contraception with oestro-progestogens is definitely contra-indicated."Stroke	EPI	"The aim of this cross-sectional survey was to measure knowledge about cardiovascular disease (CVD) among low-income women in Western North Carolina.A self-administered survey was distributed to a convenience sample of women presenting for obstetrical or gynecological care at resident and faculty clinics in Asheville, North Carolina, from July 2011 through February 2012.Responses from 340 completed surveys were analyzed. The response rate was 51.7%. The majority of respondents (57.1%) were either overweight or obese, and 23.2% reported that they currently use tobacco products. Overall, accuracy on knowledge questions ranged from 0% to 90%, with a mean score of 57.8% (SD = 16%). Women in their 20s, minorities, and smokers had lower knowledge scores (P = 0.03, 0.022, and 0.009, respectively). Gender variations in symptoms and consequences of CVD for women were not widely understood by this group. Most knew that it is appropriate to respond rapidly to symptoms of heart attack or stroke. Increasing daily physical activity and managing stress effectively were picked most often as the behavioral strategies patients might initiate or increase to reduce their health risks.This was a convenience sample and the response rate was only 51.7%, so results maybe biased.This group's overall knowledge of CVD in women was poor, with most scores below 70%, and gaps in knowledge existed for minorities. These results are consistent with findings from national awareness surveys. Educational strategies need to include gender-specific risks, symptoms, and consequences, and they need to target tobacco users, minorities, and young adults. Resources are needed for obstetrician-gynecologists to use as they assist patients in becoming more aware of CVD and reducing personal risk through lifestyle modification."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Stroke is a serious complication associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). Women with AF are at higher risk of stroke compared with men. Reasons for this higher stroke risk in women remain unclear, although some studies suggest that undertreatment with warfarin may be a cause.To compare utilization patterns of warfarin and the risk of subsequent stroke between older men and women with AF at the population level.Population-based cohort study of patients 65 years or older admitted to the hospital with recently diagnosed AF in the province of Quebec, Canada, 1998-2007, using administrative data with linkage between hospital discharge, physicians, and prescription drug claims databases.Risk of stroke.The cohort comprised 39,398 men (47.2%) and 44,115 women (52.8%). At admission, women were older and had a higher CHADS(2) (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ‰ä´75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack) score than men (1.99 [SD, 1.10] vs 1.74 [SD, 1.13], P < .001). At 30 days postdischarge, 58.2% of men and 60.6% of women had filled a warfarin prescription. In adjusted analysis, women appeared to fill more warfarin prescriptions compared with men (odds ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.04-1.11]; P < .001). Adherence to warfarin treatment was good in both sexes. Crude stroke incidence was 2.02 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 1.95-2.10) in women vs 1.61 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 1.54-1.69) in men (P < .001). The sex difference was mainly driven by the population of patients 75 years or older. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, women had a higher risk of stroke than men (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.07-1.22]; P < .001), even after adjusting for baseline comorbid conditions, individual components of the CHADS(2) score, and warfarin treatment.Among older patients admitted with recently diagnosed AF, the risk of stroke was greater in women than in men, regardless of warfarin use."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Raising interest towards genes implicates the effect of estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1) gene on cerebrovascular disease, but data are lacking regarding the effect of estrogen receptor-beta (ESR2) gene. We assessed the hypothesis that AluI (G/A) polymorphism of the ESR2 gene (rs 4986938) is associated with ischemic stroke in a Caucasian population. Four hundred twenty four consecutive stroke patients and 430 age and gender-matched controls were enrolled in three stroke centers in Greece over one-year period. Patients and controls were compared in regard to the prevalence of the aforementioned polymorphism. No association was found between variations in the ESR2 gene and risk of stroke or stroke subtype in men and women. Of note, a gender-specific association of G allele with the onset of stroke at a younger age in male patients was found (63.68 å± 12.687 years in G allele (GG+AG) carriers vs. 68.95 å± 10.757 years in non-carriers (AA), p=0.008). Further population independent studies are needed to establish the role of ESR2 gene polymorphisms in relation to ischemic stroke in both genders. Such studies could lead to ERë_ agonists being validated in individuals with certain genotypes and/or alleles towards the development of efficient strategies to preventing ischemic stroke in both men and women."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"This study examined the effects of gender on RNA expression after ischemic stroke (IS). RNA obtained from blood of IS patients (n=51; 153 samples at < or =3, 5, and 24‰Ûähours) and from matched controls (n=52) were processed on Affymetrix microarrays. Analyses of covariance for stroke versus control samples were performed separately for both genders and the regulated genes for females compared with males. In all, 242, 227, and 338 male-specific genes were regulated at < or =3, 5, and 24‰Ûähours after IS, respectively, of which 59 were regulated at all time points. Overall, 774, 3,437, and 571 female-specific stroke genes were regulated at < or =3, 5, and 24‰Ûähours, respectively, of which 152 were regulated at all time points. Male-specific stroke genes were associated with integrin, integrin-liked kinase, actin, tight junction, Wnt/ë_-catenin, RhoA, fibroblast growth factors (FGF), granzyme, and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)2 signaling. Female-specific stroke genes were associated with p53, high-mobility group box-1, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)1ë±, interleukin (IL)1, IL6, IL12, IL18, acute-phase response, T-helper, macrophage, and estrogen signaling. Cell death signaling was overrepresented in both genders, although the molecules and pathways differed. Gender affects gene expression in the blood of IS patients, which likely implies gender differences in immune, inflammatory, and cell death responses to stroke."Stroke	Management	"We sought to examine whether gender-based differences in acute stroke care occur in both Joint Commission (JC) certified and noncertified hospitals.602 charts of patients with ischemic stroke were reviewed from five JC certified and five noncertified hospitals for gender differences in the prehospital factors, emergency department evaluation, in-hospital stroke care, discharge outcome and use of secondary prevention measures.More women arrived via ambulance (63.1% women vs. 53.9% men, p=0.025) while more men came by self-transportation (42.6% vs. 30%, p=0.0016). There was no difference by gender for evaluation for thrombolytics (89.4% men vs. 85.9% women) or intravenous t-PA administered (3.5% men vs. 2.5% women, p=0.82). More patients in JC certified centers were evaluated for thrombolysis than in noncertified centers. Delay in arrival was the commonest reason for not getting thrombolysis in both groups. More men than women had mild/resolving symptoms, had more interventional procedures, and better discharge outcome. More men were discharged on antithrombotics. Even after adjusting for age, gender differences were significant for arrival by ambulance, self transportation, mild/resolving symptoms, interventional procedures performed and marginally for good discharge outcome.There were significant gender differences in delivery of acute stroke care in Michigan hospitals even after adjustment for age differences. In spite of milder symptoms and less usage of emergency services, men received more aggressive stroke care with a tendency towards better discharge outcome. Going to a JC certified center was a better predictor of consideration for thrombolytics than gender."Stroke	Epidemiology	"‰Ûâ Despite sharing some metabolic and pathological mechanisms, the reported association between total homocysteine (tHcy), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and stroke remains controversial, particularly in Hispanic populations from developing countries in which genetic, socioeconomic, and nutritional factors are different to those described in developed countries. Our objectives were to determine the relationships of these factors to stroke and to each other independent of other cardiovascular risk factors, and to explore potential sex differences.This national (Colombia) multicenter case-control study included 238 cases and 238 controls to evaluate traditional and emerging risk factors for ischemic stroke including tHcy and ADMA plasma levels.The median plasma levels of tHcy were 8.48 ë_M for controls and 10.01 ë_M for cases (P<0.0001). Plasma levels of tHcy between 12 and 50ë_M were considered moderate hyperhomocysteinemia (HtHcy). There were no differences in plasma ADMA concentration between groups (P=0.40). Plasma levels of ADMA and creatinine were not correlated (P=0.47). After adjusting for confounding factors, the presence of HtHcy was strongly associated with stroke (OR 8.97; P<0.0001). The adjusted association between HtHcy and stroke in men (OR 9.98) was comparable to that in women (OR 8.98) (P=0.41).In this Hispanic population, with relatively normal renal function, plasma levels of tHcy but not ADMA were associated with stroke independent of other cardiovascular risk factors."Stroke	Review	"The effect of statins on the prevention of cardiovascular events is well demonstrated. Whether this protective effect is equal for women and men remains less well established. Our objective was to evaluate if statin therapy is equally effective in decreasing recurrent cardiovascular events in women and men.Randomized clinical trials were searched in PubMed using as indexing terms (statins OR cholesterol lowering medications) AND (cardiovascular events OR stroke OR myocardial infarction OR cardiovascular death).We included randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials evaluating statins for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Studies with an open-label design and observational studies were excluded.The earliest citation was used to determine the characteristic of the studied population and the methodology. All subsequent citations corresponding to the trial were evaluated for outcome rates by sex.Eleven trials representing 43,193 patients were included in the analysis. Overall, statin therapy was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events in all outcomes for women (relative risk [RR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.74-0.89]) and men (RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.78-0.85]). However, they did not reduce all-cause mortality in women vs men (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.76-1.13] vs RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.720.87]) or stroke (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.76-1.10] vs RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.72-0.92]).Statin therapy is an effective intervention in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in both sexes, but there is no benefit on stroke and all-cause mortality in women."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Recent evidence has implicated the gene for phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) as susceptibility gene for ischemic stroke (IS) in Icelandic population. However, there are few reports on the associations between PDE4D gene polymorphisms and IS in Chinese individuals. The present study aimed to investigate the possible association of genetic polymorphisms in PDE4D gene with IS in Henan Han population.A total of 400 patients with IS and 400 matched controls were examined using a case-control design. Two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) (rs918592 and rs2910829) in PDE4D gene were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated to test the association between the genetic factors and IS. Genetic parameter and association studies were carried out with SPSS 16.0.Among the two SNPs tested, the rs918592 was significantly associated with IS (OR: 1.351, 95%CI: 1.110 - 1.645), especially in male patients (OR: 1.427, 95%CI: 1.105 - 1.844). Haplotype analysis showed that A-T was associated with an increased risk of the IS (OR: 2.114, 95%CI: 2.005 - 2.230) while G-T was associated with decreased risk of IS (OR: 0.419, 95%CI: 0.302 - 0.583). Protecting effect of haplotype G-T was also significant in males (OR: 0.264, 95%CI: 0.162 - 0.431).The present study demonstrated a strong association of rs918592 with IS. Haplotype A-T increased the risk of IS while haplotype G-T had a protective effect in Henan Han population. The association was sex-dependent with male patients showing stronger effect."Stroke	Clinical	"In the general population, migraine, cerebrovascular diseases, and vascular dementia differ in many aspects between men and women. CADASIL is considered a unique model to investigate migraine with aura, stroke, and dementia related to ischemic small vessel disease. This study aims to evaluate the effect of gender on the main clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of CADASIL.Cross-sectional data from 313 CADASIL patients including various clinical and cognitive scores and MRI parameters were compared between men and women, and between those younger and older than the median age of the population corresponding to the usual age of menopause (51 years).At younger than 51 years, migraine with aura was 50% more prevalent in women and stroke was 75% more prevalent in men. After the fifth decade, men had higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Rankin scores than women and more severe executive dysfunction, although global cognitive scores were similar. Age at first stroke, the number of stroke events, and the prevalence of dementia and psychiatric symptoms did not differ between men and women. Brain volume was lower in men with a trend for a larger volume of lacunar infarcts.In CADASIL, migraine with aura is more frequent in women and stroke is more frequent in men before the age of menopause. This difference seems to vanish after this age limit but may result in a higher degree of cognitive impairment and cerebral atrophy in men at the late stage of the disease. The presumable role of ovarian hormones in these gender-related differences remains to be explored."Stroke	Clinical	"Although it is widely believed that women with heart disease have poorer adjustment than men, the term 'adjustment' has typically been narrowly defined as depression. Gender differences in adjustment more broadly defined to encompass functional limitations in addition to depression have seldom been investigated, especially in general population samples with an adequate number of women.A nationally representative general population survey of 7434 New Zealanders (618 with cardiovascular disease: CVD; 335 women, 283 men). DSM-IV mental disorders were measured with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0). Health-related disability (functional limitations) was measured using the World Mental Health-World Health Organization Disability Adjustment Schedule (WHODAS-II). CVD was ascertained by self-report of a physician's diagnosis of heart disease, heart attack, or stroke.In age-adjusted analyses, cardiovascular disease was associated with significant functional limitations in a range of disability domains in both men and women, but there were no gender differences in the degree of disability.In this general population sample, men and women with CVD reported similar degrees of disability, despite women's higher prevalence of depression. This does not support earlier conclusions that women with heart disease cope less well than men."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Ischaemic stroke is an important cause of disability and death. Local inflammation in the brain following stroke is thought to enhance damage. Animal studies show that regulatory T cells (Tregs) can downregulate this inflammation and assist recovery, but there are no previous studies of the function of Tregs in human stroke. The current study aimed to quantify Tregs in peripheral blood following stroke and to investigate their function. Treg numbers were significantly increased after stroke, particularly in males. However, the functional capacity of Tregs to inhibit proliferation of autologous cells at low ratios of Treg to responder cells was reduced, particularly in female patients, compared to controls. This study is the first to report gender-specific changes in the numbers and function of Tregs after ischaemic stroke. These changes may affect stroke outcome."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Differences in ischemic stroke between men and women have been mainly attributed to hormonal effects. However, sex differences in immune response to ischemia may exist. We hypothesized that differential expression of X-chromosome genes in blood immune cells contribute to differences between men and women with ischemic stroke.RNA levels of 683 X-chromosome genes were measured on Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0 microarrays. Blood samples from patients with ischemic stroke were obtained at ‰ä_ 3 hours, 5 hours, and 24 hours (n=61; 183 samples) after onset and compared with control subjects without symptomatic vascular diseases (n=109). Sex difference in X-chromosome gene expression was determined using analysis of covariance (false discovery rate ‰ä_ 0.05, fold change ‰ä´ 1.2).At ‰ä_ 3, 5, and 24 hours after stroke, there were 37, 140, and 61 X-chromosome genes, respectively, that changed in women; and 23, 18, and 31 X-chromosome genes that changed in men. Female-specific genes were associated with post-translational modification, small-molecule biochemistry, and cell-cell signaling. Male-specific genes were associated with cellular movement, development, cell-trafficking, and cell death. Altered sex specific X-chromosome gene expression occurred in 2 genes known to be associated with human stroke, including galactosidase A and IDS, mutations of which result in Fabry disease and Hunter syndrome, respectively.There are differences in X-chromosome gene expression between men and women with ischemic stroke. Future studies are needed to decipher whether these differences are associated with sexually dimorphic immune response, repair or other mechanisms after stroke, or whether some of them represent risk determinants."Stroke	Management	"Increased platelet aggregation is a major risk factor for heart attacks, stroke and thrombosis. Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA; eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA; docosahexaenoic acid, DHA) reduce platelet aggregation; however studies in the published literature involving EPA and/or DHA supplementation have yielded equivocal results. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that inhibition of platelet aggregation by LCn-3PUFA is gender specific. We examined the acute effects of dietary supplementation with EPA or DHA rich oils on platelet aggregation in healthy male and females.A blinded placebo controlled trial involving 15 male and 15 female subjects. Platelet aggregation was measured at 0, 2, 5 and 24åÊh post-supplementation with a single dose of either a placebo or EPA or DHA rich oil capsules. The relationship between LCn-3PUFA and platelet activity at each time point was examined according to gender vs. treatment. EPA was significantly the most effective in reducing platelet aggregation in males at 2, 5 and 24åÊh post-supplementation (-11%, -10.6%, -20.5% respectively) whereas DHA was not effective relative to placebo. In contrast, in females, DHA significantly reduced platelet aggregation at 24åÊh (-13.7%) while EPA was not effective. An inverse relationship between testosterone levels and platelet aggregation following EPA supplementation was observed.Interactions between sex hormones and omega-3 fatty acids exist to differentially reduce platelet aggregation. For healthy individuals, males may benefit more from EPA supplementation while females are more responsive to DHA."Stroke	Management	"Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is increasingly used for treatment of severe carotid artery stenosis, but only few procedural risk factors for complications of CAS are clearly defined yet. A possible impact of the patient's gender on the outcome of patients undergoing CAS has not been investigated properly and only little information about this topic is available so far.We analysed data of the German prospective, multicenter CAS Registry of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft leitende kardiologische KrankenhausÌ_rzte.From July 1996 to May 2009 5130 patients underwent CAS at 35 German hospitals and were enrolled into the prospective ALKK CAS Registry. Therefrom 1443 (28.1%) patients were female. There was no significant time-related difference in the proportion of women undergoing CAS over the years. Women undergoing CAS were significantly older than men (73 years vs. 70 years, p < 0.01) and had a longer in hospital stay in comparison to men (p < 0.01). The majority of patients treated with CAS was between 60 and 80 years of age (‰ö_73%). No significant differences between women and men could be found regarding in-hospital events like death (0.5% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.99), major or minor stroke (1.7% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.97; 1.0% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.12), TIA (2.8% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.64), amaurosis fugax (0.3% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.25) , intracranial bleeding (0.5% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.43), myocardial infarction (0.1% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.48) or all non-fatal strokes and all death (3.0% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.47). 30 day event rates did not show gender related differences in the combined endpoint of the outcome of patients undergoing CAS, as well (‰ªÛ n = 31/882 [3.5%] vs. ‰ªâ n = 109/2273 [4.8%], p = 0.12).Our results do not suggest any gender-related differences in success rates and complications in CAS. In clinical practice approximately 30% of patients treated with CAS are women. The institutions and people who participated in the ALKK CAS Registry are listed in Zahn et al.16 The authors have no funding, financial relationships, or conflicts of interest to disclose."Stroke	Management	"The effect of oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT) on stroke incidence and severity has been extensively debated. Clinical trials of ERT have demonstrated an increased risk of stroke in treated women, although the study participants were well past menopause when therapy was initiated. It has been suggested that detrimental effects of ERT may be unmasked after prolonged periods of hypoestrogenicity. To date, very few studies have examined the effect of ERT in aged animals, although the timing of replacement may be critical to the neuroprotective effects of ERT. We hypothesised that chronic ERT initiated in late middle age would decrease infarct size in the brain after an induced stroke, whereas acute ERT would have no beneficial effects in aged females. To test this hypothesis, two paradigms of ERT were administered to aged mice of both sexes aiming to determine the effects on stroke outcome and to explore the possible mechanisms by which ERT interacts with age. Female mice that received chronic ERT from 17-20‰ÛÄmonths of age showed improved stroke outcomes after experimental stroke, whereas females that had acute ERT initiated at 20‰ÛÄmonths of age did not. Chronic ERT females exhibited diminished levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ë¼B) translocation compared to acute ERT females after stroke. Acute ERT females demonstrated both an increase in nuclear NF-ë¼B and enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, a sexual dimorphic effect of ERT was seen because males benefited from ERT, regardless of the timing of initiation. Aged males had significantly reduced expression of pro-inflammatory markers after stroke compared to age-matched females, suggesting a pro-inflammatory milieu emerges with age in females. These results are consistent with the emerging clinical literature suggesting that ERT should be initiated at the time of menopause to achieve beneficial effects. The present study demonstrates the importance of using appropriate animal models in preclinical studies."Stroke	Clinical	"We sought to evaluate the ability of various metabolic syndrome definitions in predicting primary cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes in a vast multiethnic U.S. cohort.This study included 6,814 self-identified men and women aged 45-84 years enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study. Gender-stratified analyses were performed to calculate hazard ratios of CVD, stroke, and mortality associated with various metabolic syndrome definitions and their individual constructs.The hazard ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] for all-cause CVD in men were 2.90 (2.18-3.85), 2.64 (1.98-3.51), 2.16 (1.62-2.88), 2.56 (1.91-3.44), 1.82 (1.35-2.46), and 2.92 (2.15-3.95) for the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), American Heart Association (AHA), World Health Organization (WHO), International Diabetes Federation (IDF), European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR), and the newly defined consensus criteria. Hazard ratios in women were 2.11 (1.41-3.15), 2.17 (1.45-3.27), 2.04 (1.37-3.06), 1.91 (1.27-2.88), 1.85 (1.23-2.79), and 2.08 (1.37-3.14), respectively. Metabolic syndrome was strongly associated with stroke risk only in males. In men, all constitutive metabolic syndrome components were continuously and strongly associated with CVD. In women, high-density lipoprotein and triglycerides did not appear to be associated with short term CVD risk.We found the newly defined consensus criteria for metabolic syndrome to be similarly predictive of cardiovascular events when compared to existing definitions. Significant gender differences exist in the association between metabolic syndrome, its individual components, and CVD."Stroke	Clinical	"Several studies have indicated that gender differences might exist in stroke.Our goal was to perform a comprehensive meta-analysis in order to evaluate and quantify stroke gender disparities through a systematic search of relevant articles published up to October 2009 and addressing gender related differences in ischemic stroke risk factors, stroke subtype and severity, diagnostic tests, and acute phase and secondary prevention treatments.Forty-five articles were included in the analysis, representing a total of 673,935 patients. Women were globally older than men (+5.2 years) and suffered more hypertension (P = 0.017) and atrial fibrillation (P < 0.001), although they were less likely to drink alcohol (P < 0.001), smoke cigarettes (P < 0.001), present hyperlipidemia (P = 0.033) or diabetes (P = 0.003) than men. Baseline stroke severity was not different between genders. Women suffered more cardioembolic strokes, while men had more atherothrombotic strokes. Moreover, women were less likely to receive stroke-related treatments, such as antiplatelets (P < 0.001), statins (P < 0.001), and tPA (P < 0.001) than men. Although meta-regression did not identify age or stroke etiology as sources of heterogeneity, caution should be taken as that analysis was possible only for gender differences in secondary prevention with antiplatelets because of limited data for other end points.Gender differences have been identified on the risk factors profile and diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with ischemic stroke. Active measures should thus be taken to avoid bias in clinical practice."Stroke	Management	"Warfarin decreases risk of stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) dependent on percent time in the therapeutic range (TTR) with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2 to 3. We hypothesized that gender differences in ischemic stroke risk are related to TTR. From the AFFIRM database of 4,060 patients with AF, we determined the incidence of ischemic stroke by gender. We evaluated the INR at time of ischemic stroke and calculated TTR. We determined the relation between gender and ischemic stroke by TTR. Women had CHADS(2) Scores (3.7 å± 1.3 vs 2.5 å± 1.3, p <0.0001) and more ischemic strokes than men (5% vs 3%, odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.26, p = 0.002). Mean INR near time of ischemic stroke was 2 for women and men; median values were subtherapeutic (1.7 and 1.8, respectively). Women spent more time outside the therapeutic range (40 å± 0.7% vs 37 å± 0.5%, p = 0.0001), with more time below the therapeutic range (29 å± 0.7% vs 26 å± 0.5%, p = 0.0002). A higher TTR protected against ischemic stroke for women but not for men. Women who had a comparably high TTR (‰ä´66%) still had more ischemic strokes (p = 0.009). A fitted Cox proportional hazard regression model showed that gender, TTR <46% versus >80%, age, and previous stroke were significantly related to stroke incidence. In conclusion, women in AFFIRM were at greater risk of ischemic stroke than men, in part related to differences in TTR. Women with AF may benefit from more aggressive or novel anticoagulation to decrease their risk of stroke."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Stroke is a serious complication associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). Women with AF are at higher risk of stroke compared with men. Reasons for this higher stroke risk in women remain unclear, although some studies suggest that undertreatment with warfarin may be a cause.To compare utilization patterns of warfarin and the risk of subsequent stroke between older men and women with AF at the population level.‰Ûâ Population-based cohort study of patients 65 years or older admitted to the hospital with recently diagnosed AF in the province of Quebec, Canada, 1998-2007, using administrative data with linkage between hospital discharge, physicians, and prescription drug claims databases.‰Ûâ Risk of stroke.The cohort comprised 39åÊ398 men (47.2%) and 44åÊ115 women (52.8%). At admission, women were older and had a higher CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ‰ä´75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack) score than men (1.99 [SD, 1.10] vs 1.74 [SD, 1.13], PåÊ&lt;åÊ.001). At 30 days postdischarge, 58.2% of men and 60.6% of women had filled a warfarin prescription. In adjusted analysis, women appeared to fill more warfarin prescriptions compared with men (odds ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.04-1.11]; PåÊ&lt;åÊ.001). Adherence to warfarin treatment was good in both sexes. Crude stroke incidence was 2.02 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 1.95-2.10) in women vs 1.61 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 1.54-1.69) in men (PåÊ&lt;åÊ.001). The sex difference was mainly driven by the population of patients 75 years or older. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, women had a higher risk of stroke than men (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.07-1.22]; PåÊ&lt;åÊ.001), even after adjusting for baseline comorbid conditions, individual components of the CHADS2 score, and warfarin treatment.Among older patients admitted with recently diagnosed AF, the risk of stroke was greater in women than in men, regardless of warfarin use."Stroke	Review	"Sex differences in stroke are observed across epidemiologic studies, pathophysiology, treatments, and outcomes. These sex differences have profound implications for effective prevention and treatment and are the focus of this review. Epidemiologic studies reveal a clear age-by-sex interaction in stroke prevalence, incidence, and mortality. While premenopausal women experience fewer strokes than men of comparable age, stroke rates increase among postmenopausal women compared with age-matched men. This postmenopausal phenomenon, in combination with living longer, are reasons for women being older at stroke onset and suffering more severe strokes. Thus, a primary focus of stroke prevention has been based on sex steroid hormone-dependent mechanisms. Sex hormones affect different (patho)physiologic functions of the cerebral circulation. Clarifying the impact of sex hormones on cerebral vasculature using suitable animal models is essential to elucidate male-female differences in stroke pathophysiology and development of sex-specific treatments. Much remains to be learned about sex differences in stroke as anatomic and genetic factors may also contribute, revealing its multifactorial nature. In addition, the aftermath of stroke appears to be more adverse in women than in men, again based on older age at stroke onset, longer prehospital delays, and potentially, differences in treatment."Stroke	Outcomes	"We examined gender-specific combined effects of smoking and hypertension on risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease in elderly Korean men and women.This study followed a cohort of 6097 residents (2593 men, 3504 women) in the general population of Kangwha County, aged ‰ä´55 years in March 1985 and examined their cause-specific mortality for 20.8 years, up to December 31, 2005. All participants were followed up more than once after the 1985 survey.We calculated hazard ratios for mortality for the combined sets of smoking habits and blood pressure levels using the Cox proportional-hazard model. The set of non-smokers with normal blood pressure served as a reference group.During the 20.8 years of follow-up, 759 people died from cardiovascular disease. The risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease and stroke according to smoking or hypertension was not different between men and women. However, the risk among smokers combined with hypertension was higher in men than in women; the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for mortality from cardiovascular disease and stroke were 4.52 (1.67-12.21) and 6.37 (1.57-25.85) in men and 2.11 (1.37-3.24) and 2.41 (1.44-4.01) in women, respectively.The magnitude of the joint effects of smoking and hypertension on cardiovascular disease and stroke mortality was different between men and women. This study suggests that combining quitting smoking with lowering blood pressure could contribute to preventing cardiovascular disease and stroke, especially in men."Stroke	Management	"Most stroke research has studied rehabilitation effectiveness and rehabilitation efficiency separately and not investigated the potential trade-offs between these two indices of rehabilitation.To determine whether there is a trade-off between independent factors of rehabilitation effectiveness and rehabilitation efficiency.Using a retrospective cohort study design, we studied all stroke patients (n = 2810) from two sub-acute rehabilitation hospitals from 1996 to 2005, representing 87åá5% of national bed-years during the same period.Independent predictors of poorer rehabilitation effectiveness and log rehabilitation efficiency were ‰Û¢ older age ‰Û¢ race-ethnicity ‰Û¢ caregiver availability ‰Û¢ ischemic stroke ‰Û¢ longer time to admission ‰Û¢ dementia ‰Û¢ admission Barthel Index score, and ‰Û¢ length of stay. Rehabilitation effectiveness was lower in females, and the gender differences were significantly lower in those aged ‰ä_70 years (ë_ -4åá7 (95% confidence interval -7åá4 to -2åá0)). There were trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency with respect to admission Barthel Index score and length of stay. An increase of 10 in admission Barthel Index score predicted an increase of 3åá6% (95% confidence interval 3åá2-4åá0) in effectiveness but a decrease of 0åá04 (95% confidence interval -0åá05 to -0åá02) in log efficiency (a reduction of efficiency by 1åá0 per 30 days). An increase in log length of stay by 1 (length of stay of 2åá7 days) predicted an increase of 8åá0% (95% confidence interval 5åá7-10åá3) in effectiveness but a decrease of 0åá82 (95% confidence interval -0åá90 to -0åá74) in log efficiency (equivalent to a reduction in efficiency by 2åá3 per 30 days). For optimal rehabilitation effectiveness and rehabilitation efficiency, the admission Barthel Index score was 30-62 and length of stay was 37-41 days.There are trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency during inpatient sub-acute stroke rehabilitation with respect to admission functional status and length of stay."Stroke	Management	"As intravenous thrombolysis frequently fails to recanalize occluded proximal intracerebral arteries, interventional recanalization therapy is increasingly being considered as treatment option in acute ischemic stroke patients. The optimal periprocedural patient management for these interventions is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to identify factors delaying door-to-treatment times, and to evaluate the effect of a fast-track intubation standard operating procedure (I-SOP) on door-to-angiography time.First, we retrospectively reviewed records of 48 acute stroke patients who were treated by interventional recanalization of intracranial occlusions between 2006 and 2009 at our institution. Time to angiography was defined as time from hospital admission to the beginning of the angiographic procedure. Second, an I-SOP for fast-track intubation was implemented and effects on door-to-angiography time were prospectively analyzed in 23 consecutive patients.In the retrospective dataset (n = 48), the mean door-to-angiography time was 2.2 å± 0.1 h (mean å± SEM). A clinically relevant time loss attributable to the intubation procedure was suggested by a 51 å± 21 min shorter door-to-angiography time for patients already intubated prior to admission (P = 0.0189). Additional factors associated with a prolonged door-to-angiography time were: door-to-diagnosis time (P < 0.001), onset-to-door time (P = 0.0117), and male gender (mean difference +27 å± 15 min, P = 0.0822). In the prospective dataset (n = 23), I-SOP implementation reduced mean door-to-angiography time by 25 å± 10 min (P = 0.0164).In acute stroke patients, intubation prior to interventional recanalization therapy can delay treatment initiation. The implementation of an I-SOP accelerates interventional treatment initiation."Stroke	Management	"Results of randomized controlled trials have shown that carotid endarterectomy poses greater perioperative risks to women than to men. There are limited studies regarding sex differences in carotid angioplasty and stenting.To compare male and female patients undergoing carotid stenting with regard to their intraprocedural complications and 30-day outcome.We reviewed patients who underwent carotid stenting between 1997 and 2007 at our tertiary centre. Distal protection devices were used in all patients after 1999. Demographics, risk factors, intraprocedural complications, and 30-day outcomes were compared between female and male patients.Among 243 patients who underwent 255 procedures, 67 were women (27.6%). The mean (SD) age of the female patients was 72.2 å± 8.4 years and that of the male patients was 72.0 å± 9.6 years (P = .83). The majority of patients had symptomatic carotid artery disease; 11 women (16.4%) and 30 men (16.0%) were asymptomatic. The following intraprocedural complications were noticed in female vs male patients: asymptomatic carotid and/or iliac dissections 7.5% vs 0% (P = .001), minor stroke 0% vs 1.1% (P = 1.00), major stroke 0% vs 0.5% (P = 1.00), and cardiac dysrhythmias 3% vs 2.7% (P = 1.00). At 30 days, the outcomes in women vs men were as follows: mortality 3.0% vs 3.2% (P = 1.00), major stroke 3.0% vs 2.1 % (P = .66), and minor stroke 3.0% vs 3.2% (P = 1.00).Although minor asymptomatic intraprocedural dissections were more common in women, we did not find any impact of sex on the 30-day outcome. We concluded that carotid stenting can be performed as safely in women as in men."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Since gonadal female hormones act on and protect neurons, it is well known that the female brain is less vulnerable to stroke or other brain insults than the male brain. Although glial functions have been shown to affect the vulnerability of the brain, little is known if such a sex difference exists in glia, much less the mechanism that might cause gender-dependent differences in glial functions. In this study, we show that in vitro astrocytes obtained from either female or male pups show a gonadal hormone-independent phenotype that could explain the gender-dependent vulnerability of the brain. Female spinal astrocytes cleared more glutamate by GLAST than male ones. In addition, motoneurons seeded on female spinal astrocytes were less vulnerable to glutamate than those seeded on male ones. It is suggested that female astrocytes uptake more glutamate and reveal a stronger neuroprotective effect against glutamate than male ones. It should be noted that such an effect was independent of gonadal female hormones, suggesting that astrocytes have cell-autonomous regulatory mechanisms by which they transform themselves into appropriate phenotypes."Stroke	Outcomes	"To explore how a stroke or a transient ischemic attack affects quality of life and to identify gender differences.The negative effect of a stroke on the patients' quality of life has previously been studied, while the effect on patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) is more unknown, especially in relation to gender. As poor quality of life may have a negative effect on rehabilitation it is important to investigate quality of life in this group.A descriptive cross-sectional survey.All stroke and transient ischemic attack patients appointed to the out-patient stroke clinic between May 2008-August 2009 were asked to complete the Nottingham Health Profile.Of 1048 patients, 379 (50%) of the stroke patients and 117 (40%) of the patients with transient ischemic attack completed the form within the first months after onset. Female stroke patients were significantly more negatively affected in all domains except the social domain than were male stroke patients. Female transient ischemic attack patients were significantly more negatively affected in all domains than were male transient ischemic attack patients. Male stroke patients had a significantly more negatively affected quality of life than male transient ischemic attack patients in the emotional, energy, social and total domains, while female stroke patients and female transient ischemic attack patients were equally negatively affected.This study shows that female stroke patients are more negatively affected in their quality of life than male stroke patients and that female transient ischemic attack patients are as affected as female stroke patients. This indicates that female patients with both stroke and TIA need more attention concerning their life situation.Increased knowledge about how transient ischemic attack patients are affected, indicate that this group need support postdischarge to the same extension as stroke patients."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Sex is suggested to be an important determinant of ischemic stroke risk factors, etiology, and outcome. However, the basis for this remains unclear. The Y chromosome is unique in males. Genes expressed in males on the Y chromosome that are associated with stroke may be important genetic contributors to the unique features of males with ischemic stroke, which would be helpful for explaining sex differences observed between men and women.We compared Y chromosome gene expression in males with ischemic stroke and male controls.Blood samples were obtained from 40 male patients ‰ä_3, 5, and 24 hours after ischemic stroke and from 41 male controls (July 2003-April 2007). RNA was isolated from blood and was processed using Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, California). Y chromosome genes differentially expressed between male patients with stroke and male control subjects were identified using an ANCOVA adjusted for age and batch. A P < 0.05 and a fold change >1.2 were considered significant.Seven genes on the Y chromosome were differentially expressed in males with ischemic stroke compared with controls. Five of these genes (VAMP7, CSF2RA, SPRY3, DHRSX, and PLCXD1) are located on pseudoautosomal regions of the human Y chromosome. The other 2 genes (EIF1AY and DDX3Y) are located on the nonrecombining region of the human Y chromosome. The identified genes were associated with immunology, RNA metabolism, vesicle fusion, and angiogenesis.Specific genes on the Y chromosome are differentially expressed in blood after ischemic stroke. These genes provide insight into potential molecular contributors to sex differences in ischemic stroke."Stroke	Epidemiology	"In white populations, age seems to modify the effect of sex on stroke risk, and compared with men, women are protected from stroke until approximately age 75 to 85 years, after which the protection is lost or reversed. Compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), Mexican Americans (MAs) are at higher risk of stroke; however, age- and sex-specific stroke incidence data are currently not available for this population.This study was performed to compare the age-specific sex differences in stroke risk in MAs and NHWs.Data were derived from the BASIC (Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi) Project, a population-based stroke surveillance study conducted in Nueces County Texas. Incident strokes (n = 2421, including ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage) that occurred between January 1, 2000 and May 25, 2007 in individuals aged 45 years or older were included in the analysis. Poisson regression using the generalized additive models framework was used to analyze the relationship between sex, age (5-year intervals), and race/ethnicity (NHW or MA) and incident stroke risk.Among both NHWs and MAs aged 45 to 79 years, men were at higher risk of stroke than women were. The magnitude of increased stroke risk in men compared with women diminished with age, and after age 79 years, no sex difference in stroke risk was observed.Reasons for the loss of protection from stroke in aging women of all races/ethnicities are not fully understood, and further study is warranted."Stroke	Outcomes	"Long term, stroke survivors have a higher risk of death from cardiac causes than incident stroke. However, little is known about temporal trends in age- and gender-specific risk of future cardiac events among stroke survivors.To determine temporal trends in 10-year risk of future major cardiac events (measured using the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score) and components of the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score among a nationally representative population of stroke survivors in the United States.Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score was assessed among individuals with a self-reported history of stroke (n‰Ûä=‰Ûä748) who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys in the United States during the years 1988-1994 and 1999-2006.In both National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys waves, male stroke survivors had higher mean Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Scores than their female counterparts. This gender disparity was driven by the >64 years age group, where men had a threefold higher Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Scores compared to women (P‰Ûä<‰Ûä0åá01). Analysis of temporal trends revealed that mean Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Scores was lower in 1999-2006 compared to 1988-1994 in men (21% (standard error 1%) vs. 28% (standard error 0åá2%), P‰Ûä=‰Ûä0åá01) and women (9% (standard error 1%) vs. 11% (standard error 1%), P‰Ûä=‰Ûä0åá06). Temporal comparisons revealed that diastolic blood pressure and total cholesterol levels were better in 1999-2006 compared to 1988-1994 for both genders.Male stroke survivors, particularly those over the age of 64, are at higher risk for future cardiac events than their female counterparts. For both genders, the risk of future cardiac events after stroke has declined in recent years; this reduction is most pronounced in men and likely due to improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol levels."Stroke	Outcomes	"Given that women have demonstrated a greater margin of benefit than men from treatment with thrombolytics in certain acute stroke trials, the current study explored whether this sex effect extends to mechanical embolectomy and can be explained by revascularization rate. The study included the 305 patients enrolled in the Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia (MERCI) and Multi MERCI trials. Demographic, risk factor, and procedural characteristics were evaluated in women and men. Odds ratios for outcomes by sex were compared in patients with revascularization and those without revascularization, defined as a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction score of 2-3 at the end of the procedure. Outcomes included a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 and mortality at 90 days, as well as the presence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). Patient and procedural characteristics did not differ between women and men except for mean age (women, 70.1 years; men, 64.8 years; P = .003), hypertension (women, 78.0%; men, 65.5%; P = .021), and number of vertebrobasilar occlusions (women, 8/159 [5.0%]; men, 20/146 [13.7%]; P = .01). Revascularization was significantly associated with favorable outcomes in both women and men (P < .0001), and rates of favorable outcome, mortality, and sICH did not differ between women and men when the vessel was revascularized. Likewise, mechanical embolectomy with the Merci Retriever was not associated with different outcomes in women and men when the vessel was revascularized. Our data suggest that the sex differences seen in thrombolytic trials might be due to factors other than immediate postprocedural large vessel opening."Stroke	Epidemiology	"To analyze previously established gender differences in cervical artery dissection (CeAD).This case-control study is based on the CADISP (Cervical Artery Dissection and Ischemic Stroke Patients) population comprising 983 consecutive CeAD patients (mean age: 44.1 å± 9.9 years) and 658 control patients with a non-CeAD ischemic stroke (IS) (44.5 å± 10.5 years).Cervical artery dissection was more common in men (56.7% vs. 43.3%, P < 0.001) and men were older (46.4 vs. 41.0 years, P < 0.001). We assessed putative risk factors for CeAD including vascular risk factors, recent cervical trauma, pregnancies, and infections. All gender differences in the putative risk factors and outcome were similar in the CeAD and the non-CeAD IS groups.Our analysis of the largest collection of CeAD patients to date confirms male predominance and differences in age at dissection between men and women. Gender differences in putative risk factors may explain the higher frequency of CeAD in men and their older age, but the putative risk factors are probably not specific for CeAD."Stroke	Clinical	"Women are at lower risk of stroke, and appear to benefit less from carotid endarterectomy (CEA) than men. We hypothesised that this is due to more benign carotid disease in women mediating a lower risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events. To test this, we investigated sex differences in the prevalence of MRI detectable plaque hemorrhage (MRI PH) as an index of plaque instability, and secondly whether MRI PH mediates sex differences in the rate of cerebrovascular recurrence.Prevalence of PH between sexes was analysed in a single centre pooled cohort of 176 patients with recently symptomatic, significant carotid stenosis (106 severe [‰ä´70%], 70 moderate [50-69%]) who underwent prospective carotid MRI scanning for identification of MRI PH. Further, a meta-analysis of published evidence was undertaken. Recurrent events were noted during clinical follow up for survival analysis.Women with symptomatic carotid stenosis (50%‰ä´) were less likely to have plaque hemorrhage (PH) than men (46% vs. 70%) with an adjusted OR of 0.23 [95% CI 0.10-0.50, P<0.0001] controlling for other known vascular risk factors. This negative association was only significant for the severe stenosis subgroup (adjusted OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.067-0.50) not the moderate degree stenosis. Female sex in this subgroup also predicted a longer time to recurrent cerebral ischemic events (HR 0.38 95% CI 0.15-0.98, P‰Û_=‰Û_0.045). Further addition of MRI PH or smoking abolished the sex effects with only MRI PH exerting a direct effect. Meta-analysis confirmed a protective effect of female sex on development of PH: unadjusted OR for presence of PH‰Û_=‰Û_0.54 (95% CI 0.45-0.67, p<0.00001).MRI PH is significantly less prevalent in women. Women with MRI PH and severe stenosis have a similar risk as men for recurrent cerebrovascular events. MRI PH thus allows overcoming the sex bias in selection for CEA."Stroke	Outcomes	"Few studies have examined the impact of sex across different age groups and over time on chronic diseases in Asia. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of sex across different age groups and over time on stroke incidence and 30-day case fatality in Hong Kong.Over 90% first hospitalizations for stroke in Hong Kong (from 2000 to 2007) were identified from the Clinical Management System of the Hospital Authority. Age-specific rate ratios (RRs; women to men) for incidence of first hospitalization and the 30-day case fatality were estimated based on Poisson regression models after adjustment for year of hospitalization.Women below the age of 85 years had a lower incidence of first hospitalization than men, and the effect size varied with age [35-44 years: RR = 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.49-0.64; 45-54 years: 0.65, 0.53-0.79; 55-64 years: 0.58, 0.48-0.71; 65-74 years: 0.71, 0.58-0.85; 75-84 years: 0.83, 0.68-1.00)]. Women aged ‰ä´85 years had a stroke incidence similar to men, but the adjusted 30-day case fatality was significantly higher than that of men aged ‰ä´85 years (RR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.05-1.23).Lower rates of incidence were observed in women than men aged 35-84 years in Hong Kong but short-term case fatality is greater in women aged ‰ä´85 years."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Stroke etiology in ischemic stroke guides preventive measures and etiological stroke subgroups may show considerable differences between both sexes. In a population-based stroke registry we analyzed etiological subgroups of ischemic stroke and calculated sex-specific incidence and mortality rates.The Ludwigshafen Stroke Study is a prospective ongoing population-based stroke registry. Multiple overlapping methods of case ascertainment were used to identify all patients with incident stroke or transient ischemic attack. Modified TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria were applied for subgroup analysis in ischemic stroke.Out of 626 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke in 2006 and 2007, women (n = 327) were older (73.5 å± 12.6 years) than men (n = 299; 69.7 å± 11.5 years; p < 0.001). The age-adjusted incidence rate of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in men (1.37; 95% CI 1.20-1.56) than in women (1.12; 95% CI 0.97-1.29; p = 0.04). Cardioembolism (n = 219; 35.0%), small-artery occlusion (n = 164; 26.2%), large-artery atherosclerosis (n = 98; 15.7%) and 'probable atherothrombotic stroke' (n = 84; 13.4%) were common subgroups of ischemic stroke. Stroke due to large-artery atherosclerosis (p = 0.025), current smoking (p = 0.008), history of smoking (p < 0.001), coronary artery disease (p = 0.0015) and peripheral artery disease (p = 0.024) was significantly more common in men than in women. Overall, 1-year survival was not different between both sexes; however, a significant age-sex interaction with higher mortality in elderly women (>85 years) was detected.Cardioembolism is the main source for ischemic stroke in our population. Etiology of ischemic stroke differs between sexes, with large-artery atherosclerotic stroke and associated diseases (coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease) being more common in men."Stroke	Epidemiology	"There is some evidence that the association of fish and marine fatty acids with stroke risk differs between men and women. We investigated the gender-specific associations of habitual intake of the marine fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and fish on incident stroke in a population-based study in the Netherlands.We prospectively followed 20,069 men and women, aged 20-65 years, without cardiovascular diseases at baseline. Habitual diet was assessed with a validated 178-item food frequency questionnaire. Incidence of stroke was assessed through linkage with mortality and morbidity registers. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).During 8-13 years of follow-up, 221 strokes occurred. In women, an inverse dose-response relation (P-trend‰Û_=‰Û_0.02) was observed between EPA-DHA intake and incident stroke, with an HR of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.27-0.91) in the top quartile of EPA-DHA (median 225 mg/d) as compared to the bottom quartile (median 36 mg/d). In men, the HR (95%CI) for the top quartile of EPA-DHA intake was 0.87 (0.51-1.48) (P-trend‰Û_=‰Û_0.36). Similar results were observed for fish consumption and stroke incidence.A higher EPA-DHA and fish intake is related to a lower stroke risk in women, while for men an inverse association could not be demonstrated."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Background. Evidences are accumulating that age and gender have great impact on the distribution of stroke risk factors. Such data are lacking in Chinese population. Methods. 1027 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke (IS) were recruited and divided into young adult (<50 years), middle-aged (50‰ö_80 years), and very old (>80 years) groups according to stroke onset ages. Vascular risk factors were collected and compared among groups. Results. Female patients were globally older than male patients at stroke onset and having higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM), heart diseases, and atrial fibrillation (AF). However, females were less likely to drink heavily or smoke than males. Young patients had a much higher proportion of smoking and drinking than middle-aged and very old patients and the highest family history of hypertension, while very old patients had the highest prevalence of heart diseases and AF but lowest proportion of positive family history of vascular diseases. Hypertension and DM were equally frequent among three groups. Conclusion. Our study showed that vascular risk factors had a specific age and gender distribution pattern in Chinese IS patients. Secondary prevention strategy should emphasize on the control of different risk factors based on patient's age and gender."Stroke	Review	"Stroke by mechanism of thrombotic cerebral ischemia is one of the leading causes of death and/or disability worldwide. Current research is under consensus that there are sex-based differences in both the prevalence and presentation of stroke and thrombosis. Here we discuss the interrelation between thrombosis and inflammation and call attention to points in the cerebral ischemic cascade where estrogen may be involved in neuroprotection. Cerebral ischemia triggers a series of events including inflammation, which is deeply interrelated with thrombosis; inflammation not only produces local thrombosis, but thrombosis can also amplify inflammation especially through the synergism of leukocyte and platelet activity. Research involving experimental animal models of cerebral ischemia has shown that sex hormones, especially estrogen, offer a degree of neuroprotection. Mechanisms of this neuroprotection may be linked to certain anti-inflammatory properties of estrogen, as well as estrogen's regulation of thrombosis through the lowering of coagulation factors, among others. It is also understood that sex hormones alter the function and morphology of platelets and fibrin networks, and changes in platelet and fibrin network morphology offer one of the earliest confirmations of inflammation. Sex hormone levels, inflammatory processes, and thrombotic mechanisms are profoundly interconnected in predicting the outcome of cerebral ischemia."Stroke	Outcomes	"The goal of this prospective study was to evaluate gender differences in rehabilitation outcome in patients after the first-ever unilateral stroke.A total of eighty right-handed patients were prospectively enrolled, 35 (44%) women, and 45 (56%) men. A degree of neurological deficit was quantified by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Functional outcome was assessed by the Motor Status Scale, Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory, Rivermead Mobility Index and Barthel Index.At the time of hospital admission there was no significant gender difference in clinical stroke severity. At discharge, we registered significantly better motor and functional recovery in men compared to women. Further, we found significantly better rehabilitation outcome in women with stroke in dominant left hemisphere (LH) than in women with stroke in subdominant right hemisphere (RH). Conversely, men with stroke in subdominant RH had significantly better rehabilitation outcome than men with stroke in dominant LH. Using a multivariate analysis we have found that men with stroke in RH had significantly higher probability to reach not only high response in mobility, but also more autonomy in ADL. The frequency of stroke in LH was significantly higher in both genders aged less than 51 years, as well as in women, while the frequency of stroke in RH was significantly higher in men.This paper places particular emphasis on substantial gender-based differences in functional recovery of patients with their first-ever unilateral stroke."Stroke	Review	"In adult life, many of the social determinants of health are connected to working life. Yet, our knowledge of the role of work-related factors for the risk of stroke is fairly limited. In contemporary occupational health research, the Demand-Control Model (DCM) is frequently used to measure work stress. Previous literature reviews of the association of work stress and cardiovascular disease (CVD) do not include stroke as a specific outcome. Results regarding work stress and the risk of CVD are less evident in working women. With the focus on working women, the purpose of the present paper was to review the current research into the DCM in relation to stroke and to scrutinize potential gender differences. A literature search was performed and eight studies from three countries were identified. Based on the reviewed studies, there is some evidence that high psychological demands, low job control, and job strain are associated with increased stroke risk in women as well as in men. Any major reduction in deaths and disability from stroke is likely to come from decreasing social inequalities in health, and reducing work stress has a potential to contribute to a reduced risk of stroke in working populations."Stroke	Clinical	"A limited number of studies consisting predominantly of ruptured aneurysms have looked at differences in anatomical distribution of aneurysms between male and females. Unlike all other causes of stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) occur more often in women and are thought to be a result of both hormonal influences and variation in wall shear stress. This paper retrospectively looks at a cohort of largely unruptured intracranial aneurysms to determine if there exists a gender discrepancy in the anatomic distribution of cerebral aneurysms.A retrospective review of consecutive patients with ruptured and unruptured intradural saccular cerebral aneurysms treated endovascularly was performed.Six hundred eighty-two aneurysms were treated. Seventy-two percentage of the patients were women and 27% of patients presented with SAH. Among women, most aneurysms were located along the ICA (54%) while men the ACA (29%, compared to 15% in women), a discrepancy evident in both unruptured and ruptured groups. Females tended to present later in life (59 vs. 55‰Ûäyears), with multiple aneurysms (11 vs. 6% in men), and with SAH (28 vs. 23% in men) - the majority of these ruptured aneurysms were located at the ICA (42%), while men at the ACA (47%). Additionally, the majority (68%) of ruptured ICA aneurysms were PCOM.Understanding the natural history of aneurysms is imperative in treating incidentally found aneurysms. Significant differences exist between the genders in relation to aneurysm location, the most pronounced at the ICA and ACA. Previously described hormonal and hemodynamic theories behind cerebral aneurysm pathogenesis seem like plausible reasons to explain these differences."Stroke	Epidemiology	"The aim of the study was to examine associations between intake of macronutrients and dietary fiber and incident ischemic cardiovascular disease (iCVD) in men and women.We used data from 8,139 male and 12,535 female participants (aged 44-73 y) of the Swedish population-based MalmÌ¦ Diet and Cancer cohort. The participants were without history of CVD and diabetes mellitus, and had reported stable dietary habits in the study questionnaire. Diet was assessed by a validated modified diet history method, combining a 7-d registration of cooked meals and cold beverages, a 168-item food questionnaire (covering other foods and meal patterns), and a 1-hour diet interview. Sociodemographic and lifestyle data were collected by questionnaire. iCVD cases, which included coronary events (myocardial infarctions or deaths from chronic ischemic heart disease) and ischemic strokes, were ascertained via national and local registries. Nutrient-disease associations were examined by multivariate Cox regressions.During a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, we identified 1,089 male and 687 female iCVD cases. High fiber intakes were associated with lower incidence rates of iCVD in women and of ischemic stroke in men. In post-hoc analysis, we discovered statistically significant interactions between intake of fiber and saturated fat; these interactions also differed between men and women (p<0.001).In this well-defined population, a high fiber intake was associated with lower risk of iCVD, but there were no robust associations between other macronutrients and iCVD risk. Judging from this study, gender-specific nutrient analysis may be preferable in epidemiology."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Gonadal hormones contribute to ischemic neuroprotection, but cannot fully explain the observed sexual dimorphism in stroke outcomes seen during life stages with low sex steroid hormones. Sex chromosomal complement (XX in females; XY in males) may also contribute to ischemic sexual dimorphism. A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model was used to investigate the role of X chromosome dosage in female XX and XO littermates of two mouse strains (Paf and Eda(Ta)). Cohorts of XX and XO gonadally intact, ovariectomized, and ovariectomized females supplemented with estrogen were examined. Infarct sizes were equivalent between ovariectomized XX and XO mice, between intact XX and XO mice, and between estrogen-supplemented ovariectomized XX and XO mice. This is the first study to investigate the role of sex chromosome dosage in the response to cerebral ischemia. Neither the number of X chromosomes nor the parent of origin of the remaining X chromosome had a significant effect on the degree of cerebral infarction after experimental stroke in adult female mice. Estrogen was protective against cerebral ischemia in both XX and XO mice."Stroke	Clinical	"To examine eating difficulties among stroke patients - a comparison between women and men.Gender differences have been reported in studies of stroke, but the findings are inconclusive and few of these studies have specifically focused on gender differences in eating difficulties.This study was a descriptive, cross-sectional, comparative study.Patients with stroke were recruited at a general hospital in Sweden. To detect eating difficulties, individual observations of the patients were made during one meal using a structured observation protocol. Assessment also included measurements of nutritional and oral status, degree of independence, stroke severity, neglect and well-being.One hundred and four patients (53åá8% women) were included in the study. The proportion of stroke patients with one or more eating difficulties was 81åá7%. The most common eating difficulties were 'managing food on the plate' (66åá3%), 'food consumption' (54åá8%) and 'sitting position' (45åá2%). Women had lower 'food consumption', more severe stroke (p = 0åá003), worse functional status (p = 0åá001) and lower quality of life (QoL) (p=0åá038) than men. More women than men were malnourished and living alone. After adjustment for functional status and motor arm, the odds ratio of having difficulties with food consumption was four times higher among women than men (1åá7-9åá4, confidence interval 95%).More women than men with stroke suffered from inadequate food consumption. The women had more severe strokes, experienced poorer QoL and showed lower functional status than the men. In the rehabilitation process of women with stroke, these factors should be taken into consideration.Structured observation of meals, including assessment of food consumption, might be necessary in acute stroke care to detect patients, especially women, who might need closer supervision and nutritional intervention."Stroke	Review	"Multiple cell death pathways are activated in cerebral ischaemia. Much of the initial injury, especially in the core of the infarct where cerebral blood flow is severely reduced, is necrotic and secondary to severe energy failure. However, there is considerable evidence that delayed cell death continues for several days, primarily in the penumbral region. As reperfusion therapies grow in number and effectiveness, restoration of blood flow early after injury may lead to a shift towards apoptosis. It is important to elucidate what are the key mediators of apoptotic cell death after stroke, as inhibition of apoptosis may have therapeutic implications. There are two well described pathways that lead to apoptotic cell death; the caspase pathway and the more recently described caspase-independent pathway triggered by poly-ADP-ribose polymers (PARP) activation. Caspase-induced cell death is initiated by release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, formation of the cytosolic apoptosome, and activation of endonucleases leading to a multitude of small randomly cleaved DNA fragments. In contrast caspase-independent cell death is secondary to activation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). Mitochondrial AIF translocates to the nucleus, where it induces peripheral chromatin condensation, as well as characteristic high-molecular-weight (50 kbp) DNA fragmentation. Although caspase-independent cell death has been recognized for some time and is known to contribute to ischaemic injury, the upstream triggering events leading to activation of this pathway remain unclear. The two major theories are that ischaemia leads to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) depletion and subsequent energy failure, or alternatively that cell death is directly triggered by a pro-apoptotic factor produced by activation of the DNA repair enzyme PARP. PARP activation is robust in the ischaemic brain producing variable lengths of poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) polymers as byproducts of PARP activation. PAR polymers may be directly toxic by triggering mitochondrial AIF release independently of NAD+ depletion. Recently, sex differences have been discovered that illustrate the importance of understanding these molecular pathways, especially as new therapeutics targeting apoptotic cell death are developed. Cell death in females proceeds primarily via caspase activation whereas caspase-independent mechanisms triggered by the activation of PARP predominate in the male brain. This review summarizes the current literature in an attempt to clarify the roles of NAD+ and PAR polymers in caspase-independent cell death, and discuss sex specific cell death to provide an example of the possible importance of these downstream mediators."Stroke	Clinical	"Several epidemiological studies have established an association between chronic kidney disease (CKD), based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and risk of stroke. However, sex-specific evidence for the relationship between CKD and risk of stroke and its subtypes is still limited.We conducted a prospective cohort study of 12 222 Japanese men and women age 40 to 69 years living in 4 communities under systematic surveillance of stroke incidence to determine the relationship between CKD and risk of stroke and its subtypes.During the 17-year follow-up, there were 566 strokes (327 ischemic and 186 hemorrhagic strokes). GFR was inversely associated with age- and community-adjusted risk of total stroke for both men and women. Compared with the reference group without CKD (GFR ‰ä´60 mL/min per 1.73m(2)), the adjusted risks of total stroke for subjects with CKD (GFR <60 mL/min per 1.73m(2)) were 1.63 (1.22-2.17) for men and 1.51 (1.13-2.02) for women. Excess risk of stroke associated with CKD was identified primarily for hemorrhagic stroke among men and for ischemic stroke among women. After adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, associations remained statistically significant. When stratified by drinking status, excess risk of hemorrhagic stroke with CKD was confined to drinkers; adjusted risks were 4.18 (2.31-7.57) for men and 7.00 (1.92-25.56) for women.CKD was associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke for men, and of ischemic stroke for women. This sex difference may partly be explained by the difference in prevalence of drinkers between men and women."Stroke	Management	"Acute stroke can result in neurological impairment or death. The Colorado Stroke Alliance and the Colorado Stroke Registry have made progress toward improving stroke care through their statewide quality improvement efforts. This report is a follow-up to a previous publication in the Journal of Neuroscience Nursing. The previous report focused on the organization and structure of the Colorado Stroke Alliance. The present report describes some of the successes and insights that have been achieved, including adherence to stroke quality indicators, gender disparities, process times for intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator/alteplase, the impact of emergency medical services, and the role that nurses continue to have as agents of change in improving hospital care."Stroke	Outcomes	"Advancements in diagnosis and treatment have resulted in better clinical outcomes after stroke; however, the influence of age and gender on recent trends in death during stroke hospitalization has not been specifically investigated. We assessed the impact of age and gender on nationwide patterns of in-hospital mortality after stroke.Data were obtained from all US states that contributed to the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. All patients admitted to hospitals between 1997 and 1998 (n=1 351 293) and 2005 and 2006 (n=1 202 449), with a discharge diagnosis of stroke (identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedure codes), were included. Time trends for in-hospital mortality after stroke were evaluated by gender and age group based on 10-year age increments (<55, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, >84) using multivariable logistic regression.Between 1997 and 2006, in-hospital mortality rates decreased across time in all sub-groups (all P<0åá01), except in men >84 years. In unadjusted analysis, men aged >84 years in 1997-1998 had poorer mortality outcomes than similarly aged women (odds ratio 0åá93, 95% confidence interval=0åá88-0åá98). This disparity worsened by 2005-2006 (odds ratio 0åá88, 95% confidence interval=0åá84-0åá93). After adjusting for confounders, compared with similarly aged women, the mortality outcomes among men aged >84 years were poorer in 1997-1998 (odds ratio 0åá97, 95% confidence interval=0åá92-1åá02) and were poorer in 2005-2006 (odds ratio 0åá92, 95% confidence interval=0åá87-0åá96), P=0åá04, for gender ÌÑ time trend.Over the last decade, in-hospital mortality rates after stroke in the United States have declined for every age/gender group, except men aged >84 years. Given the rapidly ageing US population, avenues for boosting in-hospital survival among very elderly men with stroke need to be explored."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Isoflurane exposure can protect the mammalian brain from subsequent insults such as ischemic stroke. However, this protective preconditioning effect is sexually dimorphic, with isoflurane preconditioning decreasing male while exacerbating female brain damage in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia. Emerging evidence suggests that innate cell sex is an important factor in cell death, with brain cells having sex-specific sensitivities to different insults. We used an in vitro model of isoflurane preconditioning and ischemia to test the hypothesis that isoflurane preconditioning protects male astrocytes while having no effect or even a deleterious effect in female astrocytes after subsequent oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD).Sex-segregated astrocyte cultures derived from postnatal day 0 to 1 mice were allowed to reach confluency before being exposed to either 0% (sham preconditioning) or 3% isoflurane preconditioning for 2 hours. Cultures were then returned to normal growth conditions for 22 hours before undergoing 10 hours of OGD. Twenty-four hours after OGD, cell viability was quantified using a lactate dehydrogenase assay.Isoflurane preconditioning increased cell survival after OGD compared with sham preconditioning independent of innate cell sex.More studies are needed to determine how cell type and cell sex may impact on anesthetic preconditioning and subsequent ischemic outcomes in the brain."Stroke	Clinical	"There are few population-based data regarding gender differences in signs and symptoms of acute ischemic stroke, and previously reported data have been inconsistent and conflicting.The goal of this study was to address the gender differences of the presenting signs and symptoms of acute ischemic stroke in a population-based study.All patients with first ischemic stroke occurring between 1985 and 1989 were identified; subjects were residents of Rochester, Minnesota. Signs and symptoms were collected via review of comprehensive medical records. Differences were identified using the Pearson ìà(2) test.A total of 449 cases of first ischemic stroke were identified; 268 (60%) were women. Symptoms at ischemic stroke presentation differed between men and women. Women more commonly presented with generalized weakness (P = 0.005) and mental status change (P = 0.0001). Men more commonly presented with paresthesia (P = 0.003), ataxia (P = 0.006), and double vision (P = 0.005). Signs at ischemic stroke presentation differed between men and women. Men more commonly presented with nystagmus (P = 0.002) on examination. Significant trends were that women more commonly presented with fatigue (P = 0.02), disorientation (P = 0.04), and fever (P = 0.02), whereas men more commonly presented with sensory abnormalities (P = 0.02).There were gender differences in signs and symptoms at presentation of ischemic stroke in these study patients. In addition to selected focal symptoms, women more commonly presented with diffuse symptoms of generalized weakness, fatigue, disorientation, and mental status change."Stroke	Outcomes	"Recent studies have revealed an increase in stroke prevalence among middle-aged women in the United States. To determine whether this is due to improved survival, we assessed temporal trends in sex-specific in-hospital mortality after stroke.Individuals aged 35 to 64 years hospitalized in 1997 to 2006 with a primary discharge diagnosis of stroke (N=2 537 097) in the United States were identified by the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Temporal trends in sex-specific mortality after stroke and sex differences in mortality were assessed, before and after controlling for covariates.From 1997 to 2006, poststroke mortality decreased in both men (6.06% to 5.15%) and women (6.02% to 4.88%) aged 35 to 64 years. Unadjusted analysis revealed that women aged 35 to 44 years (odds ratio=0.89; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.95) and 45 to 54 years (odds ratio=0.93; 95% CI, 0.89 to 0.97) had lower mortality compared with men, whereas women aged 55 to 64 years had similar mortality compared with men. After adjustment for covariates, stroke type accounted for the better survival in women aged 35 to 44 years. After adjustment for covariates, women aged 45 to 54 years persistently had better survival than did men. Women aged 55 to 64 years had better survival than did men, once race and insurance type were accounted for.This study revealed a decline in stroke mortality rates from 1997 to 2006 among individuals aged 35 to 64 years. Better survival among women compared with men aged 35 to 54 years may partially explain the sex disparity in stroke prevalence."Stroke	Clinical	"Cigarette smoking has been associated with lower mortality after an acute coronary event. We hypothesized that the improved survival in smokers is related to demographic differences and sought to further evaluate the gender disparities in smokers after an acute coronary event. A prospective cohort of 3,588 patients hospitalized at a single center from 1999 to 2006 was identified. Smoking status, in-hospital and 6-month follow-up death, and cardiovascular events (i.e., myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac-related rehospitalization, and unscheduled revascularization) were assessed. The prevalence of smoking in men increased over time. The smokers were younger at presentation with fewer co-morbidities than nonsmokers. Male smokers had lower mortality (3.2% vs 5.4%, p = 0.04) and fewer cardiovascular events (33.1% vs 42.4%, p = 0.003) at 6 months than nonsmokers. However, after adjusting for age and co-morbidities, smoking was not an independent predictor of events (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.17). Female smokers had mortality (5.6% vs 8.4%, p = 0.15) and cardiovascular events (54.5% vs 49.7%, p = 0.28) at 6 months similar to that of nonsmokers, with a nonsignificant trend toward increased risk after adjustment (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 1.93). Among smokers, female gender remained a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events at 6 months (odds ratio 2.35, 95% confidence interval 1.58 to 3.50), even after adjustment for age and co-morbidities. In conclusion, smokers experienced acute coronary event events earlier than did nonsmokers. Younger age and fewer co-morbidities likely account for most observed survival benefit in smokers, although female smokers are more likely to experience cardiovascular complications by 6 months than male smokers."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in women. It is known that acute CV events exhibit temporal patterns of onset, that is, seasonal and weekly. We aimed to verify whether such patterns show differences by gender.We analyzed cumulative data from our previous studies dealing with hospital admissions for CV events, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), aortic diseases (AD), and pulmonary embolism (PE), in the region Emilia-Romagna (RER) of Italy (ICDM9-CM codes, years 1998?2006). Total population and subgroups by gender (percentage of monthly and daily events) were tested for uniformity with the chi-square test, and a chronobiologic method was applied to monthly percentage of data for seasonal rhythmic analysis.Season: We considered 130,693 patients (45.1% women): 64,191 AMI, 43,642 TIA, 4,615 AD, 19,425 PE. The monthly and seasonal distribution showed respective peaks in January and in winter, with no differences by gender. Day-of-week: We considered 168,921 patients (45.6% women): 64,191 AMI, 56,453 stroke, 43,642 TIA, 4,615 AD. The weekly distribution showed a peak on Monday, with no differences by gender. A multivariate regression logistic analysis, including in the model either major CV risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus) and subgroups by age, did not find any difference in the temporal distribution of events in women and men.The seasonal and day-of-week distribution of occurrence of CV events seems to be independent of gender."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"The calcium-permeable transient receptor potential M2 (TRPM2) ion channel is activated following oxidative stress and has been implicated in ischemic damage; however, little experimental evidence exists linking TRPM2 channel activation to damage following cerebral ischemia. We directly assessed the involvement of TRPM2 channels in ischemic brain injury using pharmacological inhibitors and short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of TRPM2 expression. Each of the four TRPM2 inhibitors tested provided significant protection to male neurons following in vitro ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation, OGD), while having no effect in female neurons. Similarly, TRPM2 knockdown by TRPM2 shRNA resulted in significantly reduced neuronal cell death following OGD only in male neurons. The TRPM2 inhibitor clotrimazole reduced infarct volume in male mice, while having no effect on female infarct volume. Finally, intrastriatal injection of lentivirus expressing shRNA against TRPM2 resulted in significantly smaller striatal infarcts only in male mice following middle cerebral artery occlusion, having no significant effect in female mice. Data presented in the current study demonstrate that TRPM2 inhibition and knockdown preferentially protects male neurons and brain against ischemia in vitro and in vivo, indicating that TRPM2 inhibitors may provide a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of stroke in men."Stroke	Outcomes	"Lacunar infarction (LI) remains an important stroke subtype in Japan. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of outcome determinants in LI. This study was a single center observational study and included 163 consecutive patients (108 male, 55 female; mean age 69 years). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at discharge were used to evaluate stroke severity. We determined the location of the infarct, the grade of white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and the prevalence of silent brain infarcts, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and smoking. We compared 2 groups, good outcome (mRS score 0-2) and poor outcome (mRS score 3-5), using multiple logistic regression analysis. We found significant differences between the 2 groups according to female sex (P = .04), WMH (P = .04), and NIHSS score (P < .001). After multivariate analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-11.4; P = .03), and NIHSS score (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.7-3.3; P < .001) were independently associated with poor outcome. Elderly onset, poor outcome, and hypercholesterolemia were more common in female patients, whereas smoking was more prevalent in males. Our data indicate that sex differences exist in Japanese LI patients with regard to risk factors and outcome. The treatment of risk factors based on sex differences is important to the management of LI."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Stroke is a sexually dimorphic disease with male gender considered a disadvantage in terms of risk and disease outcome. In intact males, stroke induces peripheral immunosuppression, characterized by decreased splenocyte numbers and proliferation and altered percentages of viable T, B, and CD11b+ cells. To investigate whether the potent androgen and known immunomodulator, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), exacerbates post-stroke immunosuppression in castrated male mice after focal stroke, we evaluated the effect of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) immune responses in castrated mice with or without controlled levels of DHT. MCAO reduced spleen cell numbers in both groups, but altered T cell and B cell percentages in remaining splenocytes and concomitantly increased the percentage of CD11b+ blood cells solely in DHT-replaced animals at 24 h. Furthermore, DHT-replacement reduced splenocyte proliferation which was accompanied by an increased percentage of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells relative to castrates 96 h post-MCAO. In brain, the percentages of immune cell populations in the ischemic hemisphere relative to the non-ischemic hemisphere were similar between castrated and DHT-replaced mice after MCAO. These data suggest DHT modulates peripheral immunosuppression after MCAO but with relatively little effect on early immune response of the recovering CNS."Stroke	Review	"Aspirin is used to prevent ischemic stroke and other types of cardiovascular disease. Seven trials of aspirin focusing on the effectiveness of primary prevention of stroke and other cardiovascular events have been performed, but three of these did not include women. Data from these trials, and one meta-analysis, suggest that aspirin prevents myocardial infarction in men and stroke in women, although the findings in women were driven by the results of a single large study, and a subsequent meta-analysis did not find a gender difference. The reasons for the possible gender differences in aspirin's effectiveness are not entirely clear."Stroke	Review	"Ischemic stroke is emerging as a major health problem for elderly women. Women have lower stroke incidence than men until an advanced age, when the epidemiology of ischemic stroke shifts and incidence rises dramatically in women. Experimental models of rodent stroke have replicated this clinical epidemiology, with exacerbated injury in older compared with young female rodents. Many of the detrimental effects of aging on ischemic stroke outcome in females can be replicated by ovariectomy, suggesting that hormones such as estrogen play a neuroprotective role. However, emerging data suggest that the molecular mechanisms leading to ischemic cell death differ in the two sexes, and these effects may be independent of circulating hormone levels. This article highlights recent clinical and experimental literature on sex differences in stroke outcomes and mechanisms."Stroke	Review	"In a meta-analysis of results from 21 randomized trials comparing antiplatelet therapy with placebo in 18,270 patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, antiplatelet therapy was associated with a 28% relative odds reduction in nonfatal strokes and a 16% reduction in fatal strokes, while another trial for secondary prevention with atorvastastin 80 mg showed a 16% risk reduction in time to first occurrence of stroke (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.71-0.99). However, few studies have examined the sex differences regarding the efficacy of these treatments. Specifically, recent studies have reported higher rates of perioperative complications during endarterectomy in women. Nonetheless, to date, the data on the effects of carotid artery stenting in women, coming from diverse studies and meta-analyses, have been limited owing to the small number of female patients examined. Owing to this, the evidence of the benefit for women is unclear. Peculiar pathophysiological aspects of stroke, the higher stroke risk in some specific periods in life (e.g., pregnancy, puerperium and older age) and worse documented stroke outcome in women suggest that sex does matter in stroke management. Thus, future randomized controlled trials need to be sex-balanced, in order to better understand the efficacy of appropriate secondary stroke prevention therapy in women."Stroke	Review	"Some studies report that women with ischemic stroke are more likely to benefit from intravenous tissue thrombolysis (IV tPA) treatment, but are less likely to receive the treatment compared with men. We review the literature on sex differences in utilization and efficacy of IV tPA and suggest directions for future studies.We identified studies that reported on sex differences in either the utilization or efficacy of IV tPA treatment for acute ischemic stroke.Data from observational studies of IV tPA use show evidence of under-utilization in women, although wide variability between studies suggests that differences are specific to local conditions and populations. Prior analyses of randomized trial data show strong evidence that women but not men receive statistically and clinically significant benefit from IV tPA treatment. Observational studies of the effectiveness of IV tPA treatment in men and women have limited validity because of the absence of comparable control groups.There is good evidence that there are clinically important sex differences in both the efficacy and utilization of IV tPA, with women gaining more benefit from treatment than men. The current paradox between greater efficacy but lower utilization of IV tPA in women requires greater attention from the stroke community. Larger placebo-controlled thrombolysis trials, specifically powered to look at sex differences in treatment efficacy, and more studies designed to understand the underlying reasons for the lower utilization of IV tPA in women are required."Stroke	Management	"Studies of potential gender differences in stroke care and outcomes have yielded inconsistent findings. The Project for an Ontario Women's Health Evidence-based Report study measured established stroke care indicators in a large, representative sample of women and men with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) admitted to acute care institutions in the province of Ontario, Canada.The Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network performs a biennial audit on a random sample of 20% of patients with stroke or TIA seen at more than 150 acute care institutions across Ontario. We used data from the 2004/05 audit to compare stroke care by gender, with stratification by age and neighborhood income.The sample consisted of 4,046 patients (51% women). There were no significant gender differences in the use of thrombolysis, neuroimaging, carotid imaging, dysphagia screening, antithrombotic therapy, or neurology and other consultations. Women with ischemic stroke or TIA were less likely than men to be prescribed statins or undergo carotid imaging and endarterectomy within 6 months of stroke; women were more likely than men to receive antihypertensives. There were no significant gender differences in readmission or mortality rates after stroke.In this population-based study, we found little evidence of gender differences in stroke care or outcomes other than lipid-lowering therapy, carotid imaging, and endarterectomy. Further study is needed to assess the contribution of the provincial stroke strategy in eliminating gender differences in management of acute stroke and to better understand and target remaining gender differences in management."Stroke	Clinical	"We aimed to investigate gender differences in Turkish stroke patients.Demographics, risk factors, clinical and etiologic subtypes, laboratory findings, clinical course, and in-hospital prognosis of 1 522 patients with ischemic stroke (IS) and 320 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage prospectively registered in the Istanbul Medical School Stroke Registry (1994-2004) were analyzed separately.The mean age of IS patients was higher in females (n : 751) (P<0.0001). In males, smoking, ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, posterior circulation syndromes, and strokes due to large-artery atherosclerosis were more common (P<0.0001 for each). Prestroke disability, atrial fibrillation (P<0.0001), hypertension (P=0.041), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 3-5 at admission (P<0.0001), total anterior circulation syndrome (P<0.0001), and cardioembolic stroke (P<0.0001) were more frequent in females. Female gender was an independent predictor of poor outcome (mRS 3-6).Gender differences were observed exclusively in patients with IS. Although our patients were younger than those reported, gender differences were similar."Stroke	Outcomes	"Previous research has reported worse outcomes after stroke for women and for African Americans, but few prospective population-based studies have systematically examined demographic differences on long-term stroke outcomes. Race and gender differences in 1-year stroke outcomes were examined using an epidemiologically derived sample of first-time stroke survivors from the national REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study.Participants of REGARDS who reported a first-time stroke event during regular surveillance calls were interviewed by telephone and then completed an in-home evaluation approximately 1 year after the verified first-time stroke event (N=112). A primary family caregiver was also enrolled and interviewed for each stroke survivor. Measures from the in-home evaluation included previously validated stroke outcomes assessments of neurological deficits, functional impairments, and patient-reported effects of stroke in multiple domains. Results- African American stroke survivors were less likely to be living with their primary family caregivers than white participants. Analyses that controlled for age, education, and whether the stroke survivors lived with their primary family caregivers indicated that African Americans and women showed significantly greater deficits on multiple 1-year outcome measures compared to whites and men, respectively.Among community-dwelling stroke survivors with family caregivers, women and African Americans are at heightened risk for poor long-term outcomes 1 year after first-time stroke events. Rehabilitation services and public health policies aimed at enhancing stroke recovery rates should address these disparities in poststroke outcomes."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Sex differences have been recognized in stroke risk; however, the sex-dependent genetic contribution to stroke is unclear. We sought to examine the sex-dependent associations between genes involved in lipid metabolism and carotid atherosclerotic plaque, a subclinical precursor of stroke.For the Genetic Determinant of Subclinical Carotid Disease study, 287 Dominicans ascertained through the Northern Manhattan Study were examined for carotid plaque using high-resolution ultrasound. Sixty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 11 lipid-related genes were genotyped. Plaque presence and plaque subphenotypes, including multiple, thick, irregular, and calcified plaque, were analyzed. First, the interaction between each SNP and sex was evaluated for association with each plaque phenotype using multiple logistic regression and controlling for age, smoking, and the main effects of sex and SNP. For SNPs with suggestive evidence for interaction with sex (P<0.1 for the interaction term), stratification analysis by sex was performed to evaluate the sex-specific association between the SNP and plaque phenotypes.The most compelling finding is with the missense SNP rs11053646 (K167N) in the OLR1 gene, which encodes lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor. Stratification analysis revealed a strong association between rs11053646 and all plaque phenotypes in women (OR, 2.44 to 5.86; P=0.0003 to 0.0081) but not in men (OR, 0.85 to 1.22; P=0.77 to 0.92).Genetic variation in genes involved in lipid metabolism may have sex-dependent effects on carotid plaque burden. Our findings provide a plausible biological basis underlying the sex difference in cardiovascular risk."Stroke	Clinical	"The aim of the study was to identify differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes of men and women with acute ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke was confirmed by CT scan or autopsy in patients admitted to the 2nd Department of Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, Poland from 1995 to 2007. Male and female patients were compared for risk factors, state of activity prior to stroke, stroke type according to Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification, diagnostic test findings, and early 30-day outcome. Data on 1379 women and 1155 men admitted with ischemic stroke were analyzed. The mean age of female and male patients was 74.3 and 68.8 years, respectively. Women were more often disabled prior to stroke, hypertensive, diagnosed with atrial fibrillation or heart failure, and had impaired consciousness at admission, whereas men were more likely to smoke, abuse alcohol and have a history of myocardial infarction or transient ischemic attack. A higher percentage of female stroke patients suffered from total anterior circulation syndrome than males (21.2% and 14.0%, respectively). Internal carotid artery stenosis over 70% was reported in 10.8% ofwomen and 19.1% of men. The 30-day mortality and poor outcome rates were significantly higher in women than men (17.2% vs. 13.1% and 59.9% vs. 46.2%). After adjusting for casemix in multivariate analysis, female sex was independently associated with a higher risk of an early poor outcome. In conclusion, the risk factor distribution, clinical characteristics, diagnostic test findings, and early outcomes were different between female and male ischemic stroke patients. Female sex was associated with poorer prognosis, indicating that more intensive acute and long-term global care may be needed to improve the outcome among female stroke patients."Stroke	Clinical	"To investigate the prevalence and association of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in Fangshan District, Beijing.A total of 7 577 rural residents aged over 40 years were surveyed to estimate the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors by questionnaire survey, physical examination and biochemical measures. The prevalence odds ratio (POR) was calculated for the association of stroke / coronary heart disease (CHD) with its risk factors in multiple logistic regression models.Prevalence of CHD, stroke, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, overweight and obesity was presented as 6.5%, 4.1%, 10.7%, 39.5%, 56.7%, 44.0% and 13.6%, respectively. In the adjusted multiple logistic regression models, hypertension showed stronger association with stroke (POR=2.780, 95%CI: 2.146-3.602), while diabetes had a higher correlation with CHD (POR=2.671, 95%CI: 2.121-3.363). After stratification by gender, significant risk factors for stroke were overweight / obesity (POR=1.652, 95%CI: 1.122-2.433), body mass index (POR=1.048, 95%CI: 1.002- 1.096), systolic blood pressure (POR=1.017, 95%CI: 1.005-1.030) and serum glucose (POR=1.093, 95%CI: 1.048-1.140) in females, whereas dyslipidemia (POR=1.615, 95%CI: 1.124-2.319), total cholesterol (POR=3.932, 95%CI: 1.533-10.086) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (POR=0.072, 95%CI: 0.022-0.236) were associated with stroke in males.Highly prevalent cardiovascular risk factors aggravated the burden brought by stroke and CHD in the rural population, and the various risk factors for stroke and CHD exhibited heterogeneous contributions among the population with different gender."Stroke	Clinical	"Investigations to date have demonstrated that the underlying etiology, causes and burden of stroke may be different for women and men. However, data regarding sex differences among young cerebral ischemic stroke patients remains scarce. We conducted this study in 669 young Chinese adults with acute ischemic stroke as determined by the modified Rankin Scale at discharge. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that NIHSS score (OR 1.277; 95% CI 1.179-1.383, p=0.000), diabetes mellitus (OR 0.121; 95% CI 0.0209-0.718, p=0.020) and serum glucose levels on admission (OR 1.135; 95% CI 0.997-1.293, p=0.046) independently predict short-term outcomes at discharge in young female patients with acute stroke, but the significant variables related to male patients appeared to be Apo A1 (OR 0.165; 95% CI 0.035-0.776, p=0.023) and NIHSS score on admission (OR 1.458; 95% CI 1.325-1.605, p=0.000). In our series, our data suggest that there are several sex differences for risk of cerebral infarction in young patients, which have important implications for the diagnosis, management and prognosis of stroke in young adults."Stroke	CLIN	"The mechanisms underlying gender differences in stroke incidence, risk, and outcome are uncertain. We sought to determine whether transcriptional profiles of circulating blood cells of men and women differentially correlated with carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT), a predictor of atherosclerosis and stroke risk. Gene expression in whole blood was measured using Affymetrix expression arrays in men (n=17) and women (n=35), aged 45-64 years, with at least one risk factor for stroke. Mean average CIMT was measured using B-mode ultrasound. Expression levels of 746 genes positively and 292 genes negatively correlated with CIMT only in women (p<0.05); 881 genes positively and 597 genes negatively correlated with CIMT only in men (p<0.05). Forty-one genes correlated with CIMT in men and women, but in opposite directions. These genes were associated with estrogen, cholesterol and lipid metabolism, inflammation, coagulation, and vasoreactivity. This pilot study provides the first proof of principle that gene expression in blood cells correlates with CIMT. These results point to potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying sex differences in stroke risk. Since the sample size is small, the findings are preliminary and need to be confirmed in independent, larger studies. "Stroke	Pathophysiology	"It is increasingly recognized that the mechanisms underlying ischemic cell death are sexually dimorphic. Stroke-induced cell death in males is initiated by the mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor, resulting in caspase-independent cell death. In contrast, ischemic cell death in females is primarily triggered by mitochondrial cytochrome c release with subsequent caspase activation. Because X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) is the primary endogenous inhibitor of caspases, its regulation may play a unique role in the response to injury in females. XIAP mRNA levels were higher in females at baseline. Stroke induced a significant decrease in XIAP mRNA in females, whereas no changes were seen in the male brain. However, XIAP protein levels were decreased in both sexes after stroke. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) predominantly induce translational repression and are emerging as a major regulators of mRNA and subsequent protein expression after ischemia. The miRNA miR-23a was predicted to bind XIAP mRNA. miR-23a directly bound the 3' UTR of XIAP, and miR-23a inhibition led to an increase in XIAP mRNA in vitro, demonstrating that XIAP is a previously uncharacterized target for miR-23a. miR-23a levels differed in male and female ischemic brains, providing evidence for sex-specific miRNA expression in stroke. Embelin, a small-molecule inhibitor of XIAP, decreased the interaction between XIAP and caspase-3 and led to enhanced caspase activity. Embelin treatment significantly exacerbated stroke-induced injury in females but had no effect in males, demonstrating that XIAP is an important mediator of sex-specific responses after stroke."Stroke		"Gender differences in both vulnerability to stroke and outcome following cerebral ischaemia have frequently been observed and attributed to the action of steroid hormones. Progesterone is a candidate neuroprotective factor for stroke; however, studies are lacking which: (i) study those groups representing high risk i.e. postmenopausal females; (ii) administer progesterone solely post-ischaemia; and (iii) combine histopathological and functional assessments. Postmenopausal females, along with males, represent the group at highest risk of cerebral stroke and can be modelled using aged or ovariectomized animals. In the current study, we aimed to determine the neuroprotective effects of progesterone administration following cerebral ischaemia in aged and ovariectomized mice. Following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, progesterone was administered at 1, 6 and 24 h post-ischaemia to aged and ovariectomized female mice. At 48 h post-ischaemia, progesterone significantly reduced the lesion volume (P < 0.05) but had no effect on neurological outcome in aged female mice. Whereas in ovariectomized mice, at 48 h post-ischaemia, progesterone treatment had no effect on the amount of lesion volume present but did significantly improve neurological outcome. In a further study of ovariectomized mice, allowed to survive for 7 days post-ischaemia, progesterone treatment significantly improved motor outcome as assessed using both the rotarod and grid test. In fact, by 7 days post-ischaemia, progesterone-treated ovariectomized mice did not differ significantly in performance compared with shams, whereas vehicle-treated ovariectomized mice displayed a significant functional impairment following ischaemia. The current study has demonstrated that progesterone has different neuroprotective effects whether it is administered to aged or ovariectomized female mice and emphasizes the need to combine histopathological and functional outcomes within the same study. In addition, as progesterone-only treatment may not improve all outcomes in all groups, therapies that combine progesterone with other neuroprotective candidates should be investigated to maximize benefit following stroke."Stroke	Review	"Cerebrovascular disease constitutes one of the main causes of morbidity, disability and mortality worldwide. Obesity, a major health problem reaching global epidemic proportions, is also associated with morbidity and mortality. The present review provides an update on the current knowledge regarding the association of gender and obesity with stroke prevalence and outcome. We also discuss the areas that future research needs to point towards. In general, gender differences in relation to stroke are increasingly being recognized and evaluated. Age-specific stroke incidence is generally higher in men, except in the elderly. Women are treated less frequently with intravenous thrombolysis compared with men stroke patients and the two genders seem to respond differently to aspirin and statins. Regarding obesity, although it is a well-known predictor of cardiovascular disease, there is a growing body of evidence revealing the presence of an inverse relationship between obesity and outcome in patients with stroke or established cardiovascular disease, the so-called obesity paradox. Further research is warranted on these important topics, as human population is continuously aging and becoming more obese. In this context, the causes of gender differences in stroke prevalence and outcome and the obesity-stroke paradox should be further investigated in future studies."Stroke	Clinical	"This study was conducted to find out the possible influencing factors on stroke in two sexes. It was a descriptive type of cross sectional study, conducted on 177 stroke patients admitted in Mymensingh medical college hospital from February 2009 to March 2010. Patients were selected according to WHO stroke definition and confirmed by CT or MRI. The results of the study showed that Stroke was more common (58.19%) in male than female (41.8%), mean age of male stroke patients was 60.58å±12.36 years and that of female was 63.58å±13.62 years with no significant statistical sex difference. But after 70 years, females are more sufferer than male. Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation and dyslipidemia in male and female were equally present without significant difference, although male had a higher rate of smoking and previous stroke (p<0.05). Motor weakness was more in male than female and unconsciousness was more in female (p<0.05). Type and sub types of stroke showed no significant difference. Females had more severe stroke in terms of severity score (Scandinavian Stroke Scale) on admission. Duration of hospital stay were similar among male and female but on discharge functional scale (Modified Rankin Scale) score was higher in male (p<0.05) and in hospital mortality was higher in female (p<0.05) which was statistically significant."Stroke	Review	"Sex differences exist in the occurrence, treatment and outcome of ischemic stroke. Compared with men, women have more stroke events and are less likely to fully recover from a stroke. Given the rapidly aging population, stroke incidence and mortality among women are projected to substantially rise by 2050. This has important public health consequences. Mitigating the burden of stroke among women will require a fundamental understanding of sex differences and sex-specific issues including cerebrovascular disease pathophysiology, treatment and outcome. An aspect of stroke treatment receiving increasing but insufficient attention involves possible interactions between estrogen levels, antiplatelet drugs and stroke outcome. Emerging evidence suggests that antiplatelet therapy may provide primary stroke protection but not primary myocardial infarction prevention in women, while the opposite may be true among men. Understanding sex-specific issues related to women who experience stroke is critical to clinicians who treat women with antiplatelet medications as part of a secondary stroke prevention regimen; however, the ideal antiplatelet medication, and dose, in women requires further research. In this article we present a conceptual framework for sex differences in antiplatelet treatment response in ischemic stroke, thrombus formation and the mediating role of estrogen, sex differences in antiplatelet treatment response in clinical trials, and sex differences in antiplatelet treatment use in ischemic stroke."Stroke	Outcomes	"Although gender differences have been demonstrated in cardiac and stroke rehabilitation, it remains unclear whether there are gender differences in geriatric rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between gender and rehabilitation outcomes. We studied 1795 patients in two convalescence hospitals in Hong Kong. We defined absolute functional and motor gains as Barthel Index (BI) efficacy and Elderly Mobility Scale (EMS) efficacy while BI and EMS efficiency were efficacy divided by the length of stay. Satisfactory motor and functional outcomes were defined as discharge EMS ‰ä´ 15 and BI ‰ä´ 75. Compared with men, women had higher BI but lower EMS on admission and discharge. EMS and BI efficacy and efficiency were similar in both sexes. Female gender was a significant negative predictor for satisfactory motor outcome (p=0.0002) but a positive predictor for functional outcome (p=0.0007). Other predictors for satisfactory motor outcome were: age (p<0.001); urinary incontinence (p=0.0049); living at home (p=0.0056); admission EMS (p<0.001); admission BI (p=0.044). Other predictors for satisfactory functional outcome were: age (p=0.009); infection other than chest (p=0.047); urinary incontinence (p<0.001); Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (p=0.0004); admission EMS (p=0.005); BI (p<0.001). Women achieved a better functional outcome but a poorer motor outcome on discharge. Female gender was a positive predictor for functional outcome but a negative factor for motor outcome."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Type 2 diabetes can impair the outcome of stroke as well as increase stroke risk; however, the sex difference in ischemic brain damage is not well known, and even less is known about the difference in diabetes. We therefore investigated the possible gender difference in brain damage after stroke associated with type 2 diabetes using a mouse model, KKAy. Female KKAy showed a much larger ischemic area compared with male KKAy. NADPH oxidase activity in the brain was also increased more in female than in male mice. Ovariectomy enhanced the ischemic area, and treatment with estradiol markedly attenuated the ischemic area to that in female KKAy, with a reduction of NADPH oxidase activity. Female and OVX mice showed improvement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) at 1 hour after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, but no significant difference in CBF of the ipsilateral penumbra and ipsilateral core 24 hours after MCA occlusion was observed among each group. Severe ischemic brain damage was observed in female KKAy compared with male KKAy. Estrogen showed a protective effect on the brain, at least partly from attenuation of oxidative stress in the female brain. These findings suggest that brain damage in diabetes mellitus might be more marked in women than in men."Stroke	Outcomes	"This study investigated the gender and age differential effect of major chronic diseases on activity of daily living (ADL) disability.Surveyfreq and Surveylogistic regression analyses were employed on the 2005 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) with a sample of 3609 persons aged 65-89.After adjusting for potential covariates, stroke, among elderly men more so than women, had a 2-3 times greater odds of engendering ADL disability in the 65-69 (p < 0.05) and 70-79 age groups (p < 0.01). In comparison to elderly women, cancer, diabetes, and incontinence in elderly men was associated with a higher risk of ADL disability in the 70-79 age group (p < 0.05), and this association was also observed for pulmonary disease in the 80-89 age group. Among elderly women, however, a significant association between incontinence and ADL disability was identified in all three age groups. In addition, this association was found in pulmonary disease and diabetes in elderly women aged 70-79 years. Significant gender differences were observed in the association between stroke in the 60-79 age group and cancer in the 70-79 age group.Age and gender differences were observed in the effect of chronic diseases on ADL disability."Stroke	Review	"Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally. Awareness of stroke risk factors and warning signs are important for stroke prevention and seeking care. The purpose of this systematic review was to review existing literature that assessed the knowledge of stroke risk factors and warning signs and allowed separate gender analysis. We conducted a systematic review of all published studies (to August 2008) examining knowledge of stroke risk factors and warning signs that included women and provided results separated by gender. Two reviewers selected studies for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted data. The database search identified 2158 references for screening and 158 were selected for possible inclusion. Twenty-two studies were reviewed including 20 cross-sectional and two pretest-posttest design surveys. Overall, better stroke knowledge was observed in women compared with men in the majority of the studies although there is a general lack of knowledge in both genders. Four out of 18 studies reported better risk factor knowledge and eight out of 15 studies reported better knowledge in stroke warning signs in women compared with men. Women tended to know more evidence-based stroke risk factors than men. Stroke knowledge also appeared to be related to country of study origin, age, education, and medical history. Stroke knowledge among different populations and both in men and women is suboptimal. More research is necessary to further investigate gender differences in stroke knowledge with specific focus on how to use these differences to improve public health campaigns."Stroke	Clinical	"Gender is known to be one of the factors linked to differences in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, little information is available regarding gender differences in the risk factors for intracranial cerebral atherosclerosis (ICAS).This study investigated the risk factors for ICAS separately by gender in an asymptomatic population.We collected data from a consecutive series of 935 subjects who had no history of stroke and who had undergone transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). For each subject, their medical history was documented and tests for biochemical markers were performed. Multiple logistic regression analyses were separately conducted to assess the risk factors associated with ICAS by gender.The risk factors for asymptomatic ICAS were determined for every 10-year increase in age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-2.46), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.49-7.95), smoking (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.01-4.32), and hypercholesterolemia (OR = 3.31, 95% CI = 1.15-9.50) for male subjects; risk factors female subjects included hypertension (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.40-3.15) and DM (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.11-5.44). An additional stratified analysis indicated that there was no significant risk factor for male subjects aged <50 years, whereas hypertension (OR = 2.90, 95% CI = 1.57-5.37) was the significant risk factor for female subjects aged <50 years. For male subjects aged ‰ä´50 years, DM (OR = 6.00, 95% CI = 1.87-19.20), hypercholesterolemia (OR = 4.72, 95% CI = 1.05-21.19), and every 10-year increase in age (OR = 4.33, 95% CI = 2.02-9.28) were significant risk factors for asymptomatic ICAS, whereas DM (OR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.14-7.48) was significant for female subjects aged ‰ä´50 years.The findings suggest that the risk factors for asymptomatic ICAS differ between sexes, indicating a possible role of sex hormones in the development of ICAS."Stroke	Review	"The purposes of this review are to describe the clinical presentation and diagnostic test characteristics in the care of women with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and to discuss the role of newer imaging modalities in improving diagnostic accuracy in the detection of these diseases.Despite major advances in both diagnostics and therapeutics, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases remain two of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among women worldwide. More research is needed into sex differences in these diseases, particularly to discern whether accurate imaging can lead to early diagnosis, change in clinical management, and overall improvement in patient outcomes."Stroke	Epidemiology	"We examine gender differences in health at ages 50 years and older in 11 European countries, England and the USA.We use the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement (SHARE) for 11 Continental European countries; the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for the USA to examine gender differences in health behaviours, functioning problems, disability, disease prevalence and self-rated health.Women in all countries are more likely than men to have disabling, non-lethal conditions including functioning problems [odds ratio (OR) indicating the effect of female is 1.57-2.43], IADL difficulties (OR 1.45-2.94), arthritis (OR 1.46-2.90) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.45-3.35). On the other hand, self-reported heart disease is more common among men (OR indicating effect of female ranges from 0.43 to 0.86). These differences are not eliminated by controlling for smoking behaviour and weight. Self-reported hypertension (OR 0.72-1.53) is generally more common among women; stroke and diabetes do not show consistent sex differences. While subjective assessment of health is poorer among women, this is not true when indicators of functioning, disability and diseases are controlled.There is remarkable consistency in direction of gender differences in health across these 13 countries. The size of the differences is affected in many cases by the similarity in behaviours of men and women."Stroke	Review	"Stroke accounts for a significant degree of morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditure in this nation despite the many medical and surgical preventive measures we have in place. This article discusses how developing a universally accepted effective screening examination will help decrease this health care burden. Risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease are explored. Special attention is given to the pathogenesis and diagnosis of carotid atherosclerosis because it accounts for a large percentage of both embolic and ischemic strokes. Current diagnostic testing, in particular duplex carotid sonography, and proposed screening strategies for the detection of carotid atherosclerosis and other risk factors are reviewed. Sex-related differences proposed in the current literature are also explored in this article because they may affect how we screen for and prevent stroke.Developing an accurate, cost-effective, and universally acknowledged screening test will allow us to maximize the preventive medical and surgical measures we already have in place. Doing so will in turn lead to a significant decrease in the morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditure associated with stroke."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"The volatile anesthetic, isoflurane, can protect the brain if administered before an insult such as an ischemic stroke. However, this protective ""preconditioning"" response to isoflurane is specific to males, with females showing an increase in brain damage following isoflurane preconditioning and subsequent focal cerebral ischemia. Innate cell sex is emerging as an important player in neuronal cell death, but its role in the sexually dimorphic response to isoflurane preconditioning has not been investigated. We used an in vitro model of isoflurane preconditioning and ischemia (oxygen and glucose deprivation, OGD) to test the hypotheses that innate cell sex dictates the response to isoflurane preconditioning and that 17ë_-estradiol attenuates any protective effect from isoflurane preconditioning in neurons via nuclear estrogen receptors. Sex-segregated neuron cultures derived from postnatal day 0-1 mice were exposed to either 0% or 3% isoflurane preconditioning for 1 h. In separate experiments, 17ë_-estradiol and the non-selective estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 were added 24 h before preconditioning and then removed at the end of the preconditioning period. Twenty-three hours after preconditioning, all cultures underwent 2 h of OGD. Twenty-four hours following OGD, cell viability was quantified using calcein-AM fluorescence. We observed that isoflurane preconditioning increased cell survival following subsequent OGD regardless of innate cell sex, but that the presence of 17ë_-estradiol before and during isoflurane preconditioning attenuated this protection only in female neurons independent of nuclear estrogen receptors. We also found that independent of preconditioning treatment, female neurons were less sensitive to OGD compared with male neurons and that transient treatment with 17ë_-estradiol protected both male and female neurons from subsequent OGD. More studies are needed to determine how cell type, cell sex, and sex steroids like 17ë_-estradiol may impact on anesthetic preconditioning and subsequent ischemic outcomes in the brain."Stroke	Outcomes	"This study explored the association between income and stroke mortality in the total working population in Sweden and examined whether the associations differ by gender or for stroke subtypes intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) or brain infarction (BI).This was a register-based study among nearly 3 million working women and men (30-64 years in 1990) with a 12-year follow up (1991-2002) for mortality from stroke (4886 deaths). Income was measured as annual registered income from work in 1990. Gender-specific Cox regressions were applied with adjustments for sociodemographic covariates.The age-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of lowest versus highest income quartile was 1.80 (1.48-2.19) for any stroke, 1.68 (1.29-2.17) for ICH and 2.23 (1.53-3.22) for BI in women, and the corresponding figures for men were 2.12 (1.92-2.34), 2.02 (1.77-2.31), and 2.09 (1.77-2.46). Adjustment for covariates attenuated these associations to 1.69 (1.33-2.15) for any stroke and 1.56 (1.14-2.14) for ICH in women and to 1.98 (1.74-2.24) for any stroke and 1.77 (1.44-2.19) for BI in men. In contrast, adjustment for covariates amplified the estimates to 2.36 (1.52-3.66) for BI in women and to 2.05 (1.73-2.44) for ICH in men.Risk of stroke mortality was highest in the lowest income group, with a gradient for the intermediate groups, in both women and men. The risk of mortality from BI was highest in women with the lowest income and the risk of ICH was highest in men with the lowest income."Stroke	Epidemiology	"The educational differences in the incidence of major cardiovascular events are under-studied in Southern Europe and among women.The study sample includes n = 5084 participants to 4 population-based Northern Italian cohorts, aged 35-74 at baseline and with no previous cardiovascular events. The follow-up to ascertain the first onset of coronary heart disease (CHD) or ischaemic stroke ended in 2002. At baseline, major cardiovascular risk factors were investigated adopting the standardized MONICA procedures. Two educational classes were obtained from years of schooling. Age- and risk factors-adjusted hazard ratios of first CHD or ischaemic stroke were estimated through sex-specific separate Cox models (high education as reference).Median follow-up time was 12 years. Event rates were 6.38 (CHD) and 2.12 (ischaemic stroke) per 1000 person-years in men; and 1.59 and 0.94 in women. In men, low education was associated with higher mean Body Mass Index and prevalence of diabetes and cigarette smokers; but also with higher HDL cholesterol and a more favourable alcohol intake pattern. Less-educated women had higher mean systolic blood pressure, Body Mass Index and HDL cholesterol and were more likely to have diabetes. Men and women in the low educational class had a 2-fold increase in ischaemic stroke and CHD incidence, respectively, after controlling for major risk factors. Education was not associated with CHD incidence in men. Higher ischaemic stroke rates were observed among more educated women.In this northern Italian population, the association between education and cardiovascular risk seems to vary by gender."Stroke	Epidemiology	"To clarify the contribution of stroke to the risk of hip fracture (HF) and the influence of gender difference on HF, and to estimate the incidence rate of poststroke HF.A prospective, probability-sampling, 10-year, population-based cohort study.A National Health Insurance Research Database consisting of 200,432 randomly selected enrollees.Subjects with acute ischemic stroke (N=1951; mean age å± SD, 65.6 å± 9.8y; 56.5% men) were identified. For each stroke subject, 2 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited. Control subjects did not have any brain disease. Those subjects younger than 45 years were excluded.Not applicable.The incidence rate and the adjusted hazard ratio of sustaining an HF were estimated. The cumulative HF-free probability was plotted.Stroke subjects had a higher incidence rate of HF than their controls (women: 11.3 vs 4.4/1000 person-years, P<.001; men: 5.6 vs 2.9/1000 person-years, P<.001). The risk of HF was higher among stroke subjects, yielding an adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.33 (1.62-3.34) for women and 1.73 (1.12-2.68) for men. Compared with men with stroke, women with stroke had an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.83 (1.18-2.85). Stroke subjects had a lower cumulative HF-free probability throughout the 10-year duration than did the control subjects (women, P<.001; men, P=.005). Half of the poststroke HFs occurred within 2.5 years of the onset of stroke.Ischemic stroke is a risk factor for HF, which is at work over and beyond age and gender. Being a woman with stroke increases this fracture risk. An active program for fracture prevention might prove effective for stroke subjects, and this may be especially true for women."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Emerging data suggest that the molecular cell death pathways triggered by ischemic insults differ in the male and female brain. Cell death in males is initiated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation; however, manipulation of this pathway paradoxically increases ischemic damage in females. In contrast, females are exquisitely sensitive to caspase-mediated cell death. The effect of caspase inhibition in PARP-1 knockout mice was evaluated to determine if the detrimental effects of PARP deletion in females were secondary to increased caspase activation.Focal stroke was induced by transient or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in wild-type (WT) and PARP-1(-/-) mice of both sexes. The pan-caspase inhibitor, quinoline-Val-Asp(Ome)-CH2-O-phenoxy (Q-VD-OPh), was administered 90 minutes after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct size and neurological sores were assessed. Separate cohorts were used for protein analysis for PAR, Apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), caspase-9, and caspase-3.WT mice of both sexes had increased nuclear AIF after stroke compared to PARP-1(-/-) mice. PARP-1(-/-) females had higher mitochondrial cytochrome C and activated caspase-9 and -3 levels than WT female mice. PARP-1(-/-) females also had an increase in stroke-induced cytosolic cytochrome C release compared with WT females, which was not seen in males. Q-VD-OPh decreased caspase-9 in both males and females but only led to reduction of infarct in females. PARP-1(-/-) males had smaller infarcts, whereas PARP-1(-/-) females had larger strokes compared with WT. Q-VD-OPh significantly decreased infarct in both WT and PARP-1(-/-) females in both transient and permanent MCAO models, but had no effect in males.Deletion of PARP-1 reduces infarct in males but exacerbates injury in females. PARP-1(-/-) females have enhanced caspase activation. The detrimental effects of PARP loss in females can be reversed with caspase inhibition."Stroke	Management	"Improvement in acute stroke care requires the identification of variables which may influence care quality. The nature and impact of demographic and stroke-related variables on care quality provided by allied health (AH) professionals is unknown.Our research explores the association of age and gender on an index of acute stroke care quality provided by AH professionals.A retrospective clinical audit of 300 acute stroke patients extracted data on AH care, patients' age and gender. AH care quality was determined by the summed compliance with 20 predetermined process indicators. Our analysis explored relationships between this index of quality, age, and gender. Age was considered in different ways (as a continuous variable, and in different categories). It was correlated with care quality, using gender-specific linear and logistic regression models. Gender was then considered as a confounder in an overall model.No significant association was found for any treatment of age and the index of AH care quality. There were no differences in gender-specific models, and gender did not significantly adjust the age association with care quality.Age and gender were not predictors of the quality of care provided to acute stroke patients by AH professionals."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced brain injury is less in female than in male rats, and estrogen can reduce such injury in males. Myocardial injury occurs after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and the current study investigated the effects of gender on heart injury after ICH in rats. In the first part of the study, male and female rats had an intracerebral injection of 100 ë_L autologous blood, and sham-operated rats had a needle insertion. In the second part of the study, male rats were treated with 17ë_-estrodiol or vehicle 2 h after ICH. All rats were then killed after 3 days and heart samples collected for histology and Western blot analysis. ICH caused heart injury, including petechial hemorrhage in male and female rats. To quantify heart stress following ICH, heat shock proteins (HSP) 32 and 27 were measured by Western blot analysis. We found that heart HSP-32 levels were higher in female compared to male rats after ICH (p<0.01), but there was no effect of gender in sham-operated rats (p>0.05), nor were there gender differences in myocardial HSP27 levels. Treatment with 17ë_-estrodiol increased HSP-32 levels in male ICH rats (p<0.05). In conclusion, an ICH results in heart injury by an unknown mechanism. Gender and estrogen affect the heart response to ICH."Stroke	Outcomes	"Gender differences in stroke outcome have not been fully assessed in young patients.We conducted an observational study of consecutive young ischemic stroke patients (‰ä_ 50 years of age) admitted to a stroke unit (January 1999 to December 2009). Basal data, subtype of ischemic stroke, stroke severity [Canadian Neurological Scale (CNS)], length of hospital stay, inhospital complications, mortality and functional outcome at discharge [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score] were analyzed. For stroke severity and outcome analyses, 2 age groups were established: 15-30 (very young group) and 31-50 years old (middle-aged young group).A total of 310 patients were enrolled; 128 females and 182 males. The mean age was similar in women and men (41.07 å± 8.6 vs. 42.12 å± 8.2, NS). Migraine was more frequent in women, whereas arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, alcohol abuse, current smoking and atherothrombotic infarction were more frequent in men (p < 0.05). Females presented greater stroke severity than men [median CNS (IQR) = 8 (3.5) vs. 9 (2.5), p = 0.014] except in the very young group [median CNS (IQR) = 9 (1.8) vs. 8 (5), p = 0.022]. Female sex was a predictor of unfavorable outcomes (mRS >2) at discharge in the total sample (OR = 3.33; 95% CI = 1.41-7.84) and in the middle-aged young group (OR = 2.62; 95% CI = 1.05-6.53), adjusted by baseline data, stroke subtype, inhospital complications, length of stay and stroke severity.Female gender is associated with worse outcomes in adult ischemic stroke patients up to 50 years old. However, this effect is not observed in younger patients (15-30 years)."Stroke	Review	"Major gender differences exist in cardiovascular diseases and lead to different outcomes in women and men. However, attention and incorporation of sex-/gender-specific research might vary among disciplines. We therefore conducted a systematic review comparing publication characteristics and trends between stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) with respect to sex- and gender-related aspects.A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed to identify gender-/sex-related articles published for stroke and MI between 1977 and 2008. A specifically designed text mining program was used, and all literature was rated by two independent investigators. Publications were classified according to type of research performed, publication year, funding, geographical location, and gender of first and last authors.962 articles were retrieved and limited to 405 (42%) gender-relevant publications; 131 on stroke and 274 on MI. Type of performed research differed, especially in disease management, which received little attention (17%) in stroke, while representing the major focus in MI (40%). In both areas, clinical presentation received little attention (3 and 5%). Although publications progressively increased in both fields, an 8- to 10-year time gap emerged for stroke compared to MI. Last authors in both areas were predominantly men, but female last authorship is increasing more significantly over time in the field of stroke. Research on sex and gender differences in MI and stroke is largely underfunded, particularly by the EU.The data demonstrate how sex-/gender-specific research differs between specialties, most likely due to the diverse interest, funding opportunities and authorship distributions identified."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Studies evaluating genetic markers for vascular risk and risk of stroke are limited, and none of them evaluated obesity genes. The objective was to investigate the genetic markers related to obesity genes FTO and MC4R and the gene of type 2 diabetes mellitus TCF7L2 for their contribution to risk of stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIA).We recruited 379 consecutive patients with stroke/TIA and 379 healthy population-based controls. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs9937053 (FTO), rs2229616 (MC4R V103I), rs17782313 (188kb downstream of MC4R), and rs7903146 (TCF7L2) were evaluated for association with stroke using logistic regression analyses.The odds ratios for stroke/TIA were 1.14 (95%CI 0.91-1.42) for rs9937053/FTO, 1.11 (95%CI 0.49-2.51) for rs2229616/MC4R, 1.05 (95%CI 0.82-1.3) for rs17782313/MC4R, and 0.99 (95%CI 0.78-1.25) for rs7903146/TCF7L2. Further exploration revealed that male patients with the T allele of rs7903146/TCF7L2 had a worse clinical outcome compared with male patients carrying the C allele.The observed trends of obesity risk alleles for risk of stroke/TIA as well as the possible sex-specific differences in clinical outcomes found for the TCF7L2 (rs7903146) require replication in future studies. Our study demonstrates that candidate gene studies for common stroke may benefit from focusing on polymorphisms that predispose to vascular risk."Stroke	Epidemiology	"In our previous study, the neuropeptide Y (NPY) C-399T promoter polymorphism (rs16147C>T) was identified as a risk factor for ischemic stroke in Koreans. In this study, we investigated whether age and sex modify the genetic effect of C-399T on susceptibility to ischemic stroke.A total of 1,350 subjects (802 ischemic stroke patients, 548 healthy controls) were genotyped for C-399T using a primer extension method. The results were statistically analyzed for the genetic association of C-399T with ischemic stroke and clinical parameters.The TT genotype for C-399T was observed at a significantly lower frequency in stroke patients relative to control (CC+CT vs. TT, odds ratio [OR]=0.578, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]=0.360-0.927, P<0.05). This trend was also observed in female (OR=0.495, 95% CI=0.240-1.022) and older subjects (y>60, OR=0.556, 95% CI=0.304-1.018) with borderline statistical significance (P=0.0571 and P=0.0574, respectively). However, C-399T allele frequency was not different between controls and stroke patients in any groups. The C-399T polymorphism was found to be associated with body mass index and levels of some blood lipids.The C-399T NPY promoter polymorphism should be considered a genetic risk factor for ischemic stroke in the older adult and female Korean populations."Stroke	Management	"Gender differences in carotid endarterectomy (CEA) rates after transient ischemic attack are not well studied, although some reports suggest that eligible men are more likely to have CEA than women after stroke.We retrospectively identified all patients diagnosed with transient ischemic attack and >or=70% carotid stenosis on ultrasound in 2003 to 2004 from 19 emergency departments. Medical records were abstracted for clinical data; 90-day follow-up events, including stroke, cardiovascular events, or death; CEA within 6 months; and postoperative 30-day outcomes. We assessed gender as a predictor of CEA and its complications adjusting for demographic and clinical variables as well as time to CEA between groups.Of 299 patients identified, 47% were women. Women were older with higher presenting systolic blood pressure and less likely to smoke or to have coronary artery disease or diabetes. Fewer women (36.4%) had CEA than men (53.8%; P=0.004). Reasons for withholding surgical treatment were similar in women and men, and there were no differences in follow-up stroke, cardiovascular event, postoperative complications, or death. Time to CEA was also significantly delayed in women.Women with severe carotid stenosis and recent transient ischemic attack are less likely to undergo CEA than men, and surgeries are more delayed."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Rurality, characterized with limited access to emergency stroke care, adds another risk factor to victims of stroke. Although there is a growing literature on gender differences, very little is known about how these gender differences intersect with rurality. A random sample of 2,000 adults were invited to participate (n=1,114) in a mail survey in West Virginia. The population is split into four groups: urban men, urban women, rural men and rural women. The findings suggest that rural older women face higher risks of stroke than other groups. The study recommends that this group be targeted by campaigns to raise stroke awareness."Stroke	Review	"Sex is emerging as an important factor in the etiology and expression of many different pathological conditions, including stroke. Initially, the levels of sex hormones were thought to be the major contributor to these sex differences, especially after puberty, when gonadal steroid levels sharply diverge between the sexes. More recently, it is recognized that sex differences also result from the organizational effects of sex hormone exposure early in development, even in the absence of hormone exposure later in life, as well as effects mediated by the sex chromosomes themselves. Epigenetic modifications of developmental genes important in sexual differentiation and the response to sex steroid hormones are also emerging as another important contributor to sex differences in disease expression. This review describes recent research on the relationship between hormones, organizational-activational effects of gonadal steroids, and epigenetic modifications in brain pathology, focusing specifically on cerebral ischemia."Stroke	Clinical	"The prevalence of fatigue following stroke and Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) is disputed, with prevalences ranging from 30% to 72% reported. We hypothesized that methods and descriptors used may substantially affect the prevalence reported.Subjects completed validated assessments of fatigue and sleepiness (the Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS] and Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]) as well as 5-point Likert scores on frequency of symptoms using the 5 statements of fatigue derived from patient interviews.Among the 91 subjects, the mean FSS score was 3.8. FSS score correlated more strongly with the statement ""I have a lack of energy"" (r=0.470; ì<0.001; Spearman's rho) than with the statement ""I feel physical fatigue"" (r=0.349; ì=0.001). The statement ""I have a lack of energy"" also produced the highest prevalence of severe symptoms, with 37% agreeing that they had the symptom ""often"" or ""always."" Agreement between Likert scales was only fair, the best being that for ""I have a lack of energy"" and ""I feel physical fatigue"" (ë¼=0.50). There was a gender difference in simple expression of fatigue, with the statement ""I feel physical fatigue"" correlating strongly with FSS score in males (r=0.61; ì<0.001) but not correlating in females (r=0.039; ì=0.29). Depending on which definition of fatigue was used, the prevalence of fatigue varied between 13% and 63%. FSS score correlated weakly with ESS score (r=0.287; ì=0.008). Our data indicate significant variation in the prevalence of fatigue among subjects with stroke and transient ischemic attack depending on the descriptors and methods used to define it.There is a significant difference between the genders in how fatigue is expressed."Stroke	Outcomes	"Randomized trials suggested a different benefit of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) between men and women with anterior circulation stroke because of a worse outcome of women in the control group.We compared outcome and recanalization in men and women with basilar artery occlusion treated with antithrombotic treatment alone, IVT or combined IVT-IAT, or IAT in the Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study.Overall, 389 male and 226 female patients were analyzed. In the antithrombotic treatment group, 68 of 111 (61%) men and 47 of 70 (67%) women had a poor outcome defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 to 6 (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.24), in the IVT/combined IVT-IAT group, 47 of 77 (61%) men and 24 of 43 (56%) women (aRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.60), and in the IAT group, 142 of 185 (77%) men and 71 of 102 (70%) women (aRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.17). Mortality was not different between men and women in the antithrombotic treatment group (aRR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.16), the IVT/combined IVT-IAT group (aRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.73), or in the IAT group (aRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.36). Insufficient recanalization after combined IVT-IAT or IAT was similar in men and women (23% versus 22%; aRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.46).In patients with acute basilar artery occlusion, no significant gender differences for outcome and recanalization were observed, regardless of treatment modality."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and of cerebrovascular complications. Transforming growth factor-ë_ (TGF-ë_) is a pleiotropic cytokine with a central role in inflammation. To investigate whether polymorphisms of the TGF-ë_1 gene can modify the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in Chinese population, we conduct this hospital-based, case-control study.Transforming growth factor-ë_1 genotype was determined in 450 Chinese patients (306 male and 144 female) with IS and 450 control subjects (326 male and 124 female).Subjects carrying 869TT were susceptible to IS (odds ratio [OR] =1.58; P=0.003). Further analysis of IS data partitioned by gender revealed the female-specific association with 869T/C (OR=2.64; P=0.001).Findings suggest that the TT genotype of 869T/C might be a risk factor of IS in Chinese, especially in females."Stroke	Outcomes	"This prospective longitudinal study investigated gender differences in caregiving spouses' adjustment to the challenges of a poststroke life situation based on the caregiving stress model of Yee and Schulz (2000), which we modified.The sample consisted of 97 stroke-survivor and spouse dyads who were questioned 3 months after stroke and again 1 year later. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck & Steer, 1997), the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), and the Giessen Complaints List (BrÌ_hler & Scheer, 1995) were used to capture mental health and physical complaints in stroke survivors' spouses. Covariance analytical methods (analysis of covariance; ANCOVA) were conducted on data from both measuring times to test gender-related interaction effects.Generally, women caregivers reported more anxiety and depressive symptoms than did their men counterparts. However, 15 months after stroke onset, in cases where individuals with stroke had substantial cognitive and mental impairments, the opposite appeared to be true. The results supported the modified caregiving stress model. Women spousal caregivers seem to adjust better to cognitive and emotional changes in their partners than did caregiving husbands.The rehabilitation of stroke survivors may be more successful if gender differences in caregivers' adaptation to their partners' mental changes are taken into consideration in intervention programs for families of stroke survivors. Men spousal caregivers may need counseling aimed at supporting their adjustment to stroke-related cognitive and emotional changes in their wives."Stroke	Outcomes	"Although many aspects of stroke are similar at both sexes, however, there are some differences and characteristics as well. The aim of this study was to analyze sex differences in patients with acute ischemic stroke (IS) regarding to risk factors, subtypes, stroke severity and outcome. From January 1st 2001 to December 31st 2005 at the Department of Neurology Tuzla 2833 patients were admitted with acute ischemic stroke (IS). We were analyzed risk factors, subtypes, stroke severity (Scandinavian Stroke Scale), and thirty-day outcome. There were 1484 (52.3%) female, and they were older than male (67.8 +/- 10.6 vs. 65.7 +/- 10.5, p<0.0001). Hypertension (78% vs. 67%, p<0.0001), heart diseases (50% vs. 45%, p=0.009), atrial fibrillation (22% vs. 14%, p<0.0001) and diabetes mellitus (33% vs. 21%, p<0.0001) were frequently in female, while smoking (45% vs. 14%) and alcohol overuse (18% vs. 0,6%) in male (p<0.0001). Atherothrombotic type of ischemic stroke was frequently in male (37.4% vs. 31.6%, p=0.0013) and cardioembolic in female (21.7% vs. 15.5%, p<0.0001). At admission female had lower SS (SS 31.0 +/- 15 vs. 34.0 +/- 15, p<0.0001). Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in female (23.3% vs. 18.4%, p=0.0015), and favourable outcome within one month (Rankin Scale <or= 2) had 58% male and 51% female (p=0.001). The frequency of ischemic stroke is higher in female who are older than male. There are some sex differences according to the distribution of risk factors and subtypes of ischemic stroke. Stroke severity at admission, thirty-day mortality, and disability are higher in female."Stroke	Management	"Women may have poorer outcomes after stroke than men because of differences in their acute management. We examined sex differences in presentation, severity, in-hospital treatment, and early mortality in a cohort of first-ever-in-a-lifetime stroke patients.Data were collected from May 1, 1996, to April 30, 1999, in the North East Melbourne Stroke Incidence Study. Stroke symptoms, prestroke medical history, in-hospital investigations, admission and discharge medications, initial stroke severity, and 28-day mortality were recorded. Multivariable regression was used to estimate sex differences in treatment, investigations, and 28-day mortality.A total of 1,316 patients were included. Women were older (mean age 76 +/- 0.6 vs 72 +/- 0.6, p < 0.01), had more severe strokes (median NIH Stroke Scale score 6 vs 5, p < 0.01), and more likely to experience loss of consciousness (31% vs 23%, p = 0.003) and incontinence (22% vs 11%, p = 0.01) than men. Women were less often on lipid-lowering therapy on admission. Echocardiography and carotid investigations were less frequently performed in women due to greater age and stroke severity. Women had greater 28-day mortality (32% vs 21%, p < 0.001) and stroke severity (44% vs 36%, p = 0.01) than men, but adjustment for age, comorbidities, and stroke severity (for mortality only) completely attenuated these associations.Sex differences seen in this study were mostly explained by women's older age, greater comorbidity, and stroke severity. The reasons for differences according to age may need further examination."Stroke	Outcomes	"Improvements in recovery rates may contribute to an increase in healthy life expectancy. It is unclear, however, whether such changes take place because health researchers traditionally deal with changes in incidence and survival from diseases. The purpose of this study was to test for the presence of time trends in the recovery rate from stroke.We compared age patterns of recovery rates from stroke evaluated in 2 subcohorts represented in the National Long-Term Care Survey data linked with the Medicare service use files.We found a statistically significant increase in recovery rate between 1994 and 1999 for females but not for males.Time trends in recovery rate from stroke exist and can be detected from available data. The roles of influential factors and causes of sex difference in recovery improvement deserve further studies."Stroke	Epidemiology	"This study aimed at identifying gender-specific differences in stroke knowledge, stroke risk perception and the educational effects of a multimodal educational intervention. We performed computer-assisted telephone surveys among an average sample of 500 members of the general public (44.0% male, 56.0% female), before and immediately after an intense 3-month educational stroke campaign in a western German area of 400,000 inhabitants. The intervention was comprised of poster advertisements and various print media. Slogans and stroke interest stories appeared regularly in local newspapers, on television and radio and public events focussed on the subject. Even before the intervention, more women than men were able to name at least one stroke warning sign (71.3 vs. 57.8%, p < 0.01), to name the correct emergency call number (33.3 vs. 24.3%, p < 0.05) or to cite the correct action in acute stroke (""call emergency care"", 87.2 vs. 70.1%, p < 0.001). In some aspects women showed a generally better improvement of knowledge after the campaign (e.g. correct emergency call number: +5.7 vs. +1.2%, p < 0.05). Fewer women than men considered themselves as being at risk of stroke (30.9 vs. 36.9%. p < 0.01) with a significant increase following the intervention in both sexes (38.9/46.0%, p < 0.01). The perception of different educational media varied between the sexes. For example, female sex was independently associated with a better recall of poster advertisements and flyers in pharmacies and at the doctor's office (OR 1.44). Our data indicate that educational programs do have gender-specific effects. Women show a better stroke knowledge and in some aspects a better chance to gain information from classical broad educational interventions. Future campaigns should be tailored economically, and should focus different media and educational messages on the two sexes accordingly."Stroke	Outcomes	"In the UK, overall stroke mortality has declined. A similar trend has been seen in coronary heart disease, although recent reports suggest this decline might be levelling off in middle-aged adults.To investigate recent trends in stroke mortality among those aged 40-69 years in England.The authors used routine annual aggregated stroke death and population data for England for the years 1979-2005 to investigate time trends in gender-specific mortalities for adults aged 40 to 69 years. The authors applied log-linear modelling to isolate effects attributable to age, linear 'drift' over time, time period and birth cohort.Between 1979 and 2005, age-standardised stroke mortality aged 40 to 69 years dropped from 93 to 30 per 100,000 in men and from 62 to 18 per 100,000 in women. Mortality was higher in older age groups, but the difference between the older and younger age groups appears to have decreased over time for both sexes. Modelling of the data suggests an average annual reduction in stroke deaths of 4.0% in men and 4.3% in women, although this decrease has been particularly marked in the last few years. However, we also observed a relative rate increase in mortality among those born since the mid-1940s compared with earlier cohorts; this appears to have been sustained in men, which explains the levelling off in the rate of mortality decline observed in recent years in the younger middle-aged.If observed trends in middle-aged adults continue, overall stroke mortalities may start to increase again."Stroke	Epidemiology	"We studied the age and gender difference between acute coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke risk and examined the extent to which such a difference may be explained by known risk factors.Data from Finnish and Swedish population-based cohorts including 9278 individuals were collaboratively analysed. Hazards ratios (95% confidence intervals) for coronary heart disease and stroke incidence were estimated using the Cox-proportional hazards model.The incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke was higher in all age groups in men than in women, and the gender difference was more marked for coronary heart disease than for ischaemic stroke. There was a 10-year lag in the development of coronary heart disease and stroke in women compared with men. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for the incidence of coronary heart disease in men and women were 3.87 (2.49-6.02) and 1.71 (1.07-2.74) at age 50-59 years, and 7.22 (4.59-11.36) and 3.49 (2.18-5.57) at age 60-69 years compared with women aged 40-49 years. For ischaemic stroke, they were 2.64 (1.45-4.82) and 2.17 (1.18-3.97) at age 50-59 years, and 5.19 (2.81-9.58) and 4.89 (2.67-8.97) at age 60-69 years, respectively.Acute coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke events appeared approximately 10 years earlier in men than in women, and these rates remained higher in men than in women in all age groups. The gender difference was more marked for coronary heart disease than for ischaemic stroke. This may be taken into account when developing interventions and treatment strategies."Stroke	Review	"Beyond epidemiological differences, it has been controversial whether any important sex differences exist in the treatment of stroke. In this review paper, the following areas are covered: thrombolysis, stroke unit care, secondary prevention, surgical treatment, and rehabilitation. Additionally, symptoms at stroke onset, as well as outcome measures, such as death, dependency, stroke recurrence, quality of life, and depression are reviewed.Search in PubMed, tables-of-contents, review articles, and reference lists after studies that include information about sex differences in stroke care.Ninety papers are included in this review. Women suffer more from cortical and non-traditional symptoms. Men and women benefit equally from thrombolysis and stroke unit care. Women with cardioembolic strokes may benefit more from anticoagulant therapy. Most studies have not found any tendency towards sexism in the choice of treatment. Post-stroke depression and low quality-of-life seem to be more common among women. Mortality rates are higher among men in some studies, while long-term ADL-dependency seems to be more common among women.Sex differences in stroke treatment and outcome are small, with no unequivocal proof of sex discrimination. Women have less favourable functional outcome because of higher age at stroke onset and more severe strokes."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Cerebral infarct volume is typically smaller in premenopausal females than in age-matched males after ischemic stroke, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study we provide evidence in mice that this gender difference only occurs when the ischemic brain is reperfused. The limited tissue salvage achieved by reperfusion in male mice is associated with increased expression of proinflammatory proteins, including cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), Nox2, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and infiltration of Nox2-containing T lymphocytes into the infarcted brain, whereas such changes are minimal in female mice after ischemia-reperfusion (I-R). Infarct volume after I-R was no greater at 72 h than at 24 h in either gender. Infarct development was Nox2 dependent in male but not in female mice, and Nox2 within the infarct was predominantly localized in T lymphocytes. Stroke resulted in an approximately 15-fold increase in Nox2-dependent superoxide production by circulating, but not spleen-derived, T lymphocytes in male mice, and this was approximately sevenfold greater than in female mice. These circulating immune cells may thus represent a major and previously unrecognized source of superoxide in the acutely ischemic and reperfused brain of males (and potentially in postmenopausal females). Our findings provide novel insights into mechanisms that could be therapeutically targeted in acute ischemic stroke patients who receive thrombolysis therapy to induce cerebral reperfusion."Stroke	Management	"The majority of stroke fatalities occur in elderly women. We compared prescribing and adherence to antihypertensive therapies shown to reduce fatal and nonfatal stroke recurrence among elderly women and men with acute stroke.Using the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network, we identified all patients >or=66 years of age discharged home from 11 tertiary care centers with acute stroke (July 1, 2003, through March 31, 2006) in Ontario, Canada. Stroke cases were linked to the Ontario Drug Benefits Database and evaluated for prescription claims for thiazide diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, beta blocker, angiotensin receptor blocker, or calcium channel blocker within 1 year of discharge from hospital. One-year adherence was assessed using the proportion of days covered with suboptimal adherence defined as a proportion of days covered <0.8.A total of 3571 patients (51.6% women) >or=66 years of age with acute stroke were discharged home, with 87.6% of women and 84.7% of men treated with antihypertensive therapy within 1 year of stroke. Men were more likely than women to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor monotherapy but just as likely to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretic combination. Women were more likely to be prescribed all other classes of antihypertensive therapy. Suboptimal adherence occurred in 32% of patients receiving thiazide diuretics, 25% for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and 38% for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretic combination. There were no sex differences in adherence to these antihypertensive therapies. Patients who died after stroke had lower adherence to antihypertensive therapy compared with those who survived.In a cohort of elderly stroke patients, women were generally just as likely or more likely than men to receive antihypertensive prescriptions after stroke. Drug adherence was similarly poor in women and men."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Accumulation of iron after intracerebral hemorrhage causes free radical formation and oxidative damage resulting in liquefaction. The aim of this study was the investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying estrogen-mediated neuroprotective effect against iron-induced brain injury in vivo.Age-matched male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were stereotaxically infused with either ferrous citrate (FC) or saline (10 muL) into the right caudate nucleus. Beta-estradiol 3-benzoate (E(2)) capsule was implanted subcutaneously at 24 hours before infusion of FC. The severity of brain injury and neurological deficits were measured by histological quantification and forelimb asymmetry test, respectively. The role of thioredoxin (Trx) in E(2)-mediated neuroprotective effect was examined by intrastriatal administration of a Trx reductase inhibitor, 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and small interfering RNA.FC induced greater brain injury in male rats than females. E(2) treatment reduced FC-induced brain injury in both sexes. E(2) significantly increased protein level and activity of Trx in the caudate nucleus of females but not males. Administration of female rats with 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or Trx small interfering RNA to the caudate nucleus decreased the protective effect of E(2) against FC-induced injury. The protein and mRNA levels of estrogen receptor alpha, but not estrogen receptor beta, were more abundant in the caudate nucleus of female rats.Increase of brain Trx activity might play an important role in the E(2)-mediated neuroprotective effect against FC-induced brain injury in female rats. Understanding of the sex differences in the Trx-mediated neuroprotective effect by E(2) might help in improving treatment of brain dysfunction after hemorrhagic stroke and/or head trauma."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Stroke has a greater effect on women than men owing to the fact that women have more stroke events and are less likely to recover. Age-specific stroke rates are higher in men; however, because of women's longer life expectancy and the much higher incidence of stroke at older ages, women have more stroke events than men overall. The aims of this prospective study in consecutive patients were to assess whether there are gender differences in stroke risk factors, treatment or outcome. Consecutive patients with ischemic stroke were included in this prospective study at four study centers. Disability was assessed using a modified Rankin Scale score (>or=3 indicating disabling stroke) in both genders at 90 days. Outcomes and risk factors in both genders were compared using the chi(2) test. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify any independent predictors of outcome. A total of 1136 patients were included in this study; of these, 494 (46%) were female. Women were statistically older compared with men: 76.02 (+/- 12.93) and 72.68 (+/- 13.27) median years of age, respectively. At admission, females had higher NIH Stroke Scale scores compared with males (9.4 [+/- 6.94] vs 7.6 [+/- 6.28] for men; p = 0.0018). Furthermore, females tended to have more cardioembolic strokes (153 [30%] vs 147 [23%] for men; p = 0.004). Males had lacunar and atherosclerotic strokes more often (146 [29%] vs 249 [39%] for men; p = 0.002, and 68 [13%] vs 123 [19%] for men; p = 0.01, respectively). The mean modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months was also significantly different between genders, at 2.5 (+/- 2.05) for women and 2.1 (+/- 2.02) for men (p = 0.003). However, at multivariate analysis, female gender was not an indicator for negative outcome. It was concluded that female gender was not an independent factor for negative outcome. In addition, both genders demonstrated different stroke pathophysiologies. These findings should be taken into account when diagnostic workup and treatment are being planned."Stroke	Review	"Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States and affects 15 million people worldwide. Studies performed in various parts of the world have found differences between sexes in stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, and outcomes. Although men are at higher risk of stroke for most age groups below age 85 years, after this age the incidence reverses dramatically, with women being much more at risk. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that women have worse recovery than men post-stroke. Many aspects of recovery may influence this outcome, including sex-specific comorbidities, aggressiveness of acute treatment, prevention therapies, and varying degrees of social support and rates of depression. It is important to further define and investigate sex differences in stroke incidence, care, treatment, and outcomes to improve functional recovery in women."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Xenon preconditioning induces tolerance to the consequences of an injurious stimulus such as cerebral ischaemia. There have been surprisingly few studies investigating gender difference in the efficacy of pharmacological preconditioning, despite the known ability of oestradiol to exert neuroprotectant activity. We explored this paradigm using a mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. C57BL/6 mice both male and female received either 2 h of 70% xenon (preconditioning) or 70% nitrogen (control) balanced with oxygen. Twenty-four hours later animals underwent 1 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion and then allowed to recover. After a further 24 h, functional neurological outcome and cerebral infarct size were evaluated. Western blotting was used to detect activity of signalling pathways involving hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and phospho-Akt for the preconditioning effect. Both xenon preconditioned male and females showed improved functional outcome on focal deficit scales (P<0.05). Cerebral infarct volumes were significantly reduced in both xenon treated male and females (P<0.01). There was no significant difference between the male and female cohorts. HIF-1alpha and phospho-Akt were quantitatively upregulated in both sexes. Our data suggested that xenon preconditioning improved histological and neurological functional outcome in both gender in a stroke model of mice."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Several studies have indicated an association between depression and the development of stroke, but few studies have focused on gender differences, although both depression and stroke are more common in women than in men. The aim of the present study was to describe whether vital exhaustion, a measure of fatigue and depression, prospectively predicts ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in a large cohort, with particular focus on gender differences.The cohort was composed of 5219 women and 3967 men without cardiovascular disease who were examined in the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1991-1994. Subjects were followed for 6-9 years. Fatal and nonfatal strokes were ascertained from the Danish National Register of Patients. Cox proportional hazards model was used to describe vital exhaustion as a potential risk factor for stroke.Four hundred nine validated strokes occurred. A dose-response relationship between vital exhaustion score and the risk of stroke was found in women reaching a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.27 (95% confidence interval: 1.42-3.62) for the group with the highest score. HR was only slightly attenuated by multivariate adjustment. There was no association between vital exhaustion score and stroke in men. HR was strongest for ischemic stroke, whereas no association was seen for hemorrhagic stroke.Vital exhaustion, a measure of fatigue, conveyed an increased risk of ischemic stroke in women, but not in men, in this study sample."Stroke	Outcomes	"To describe self-reported life satisfaction of younger persons after stroke and to investigate differences between men and women and factors associated with life satisfaction.A cross-sectional study.Subjects were all persons after stroke, aged 18-55 years, registered in the Swedish National Quality Register for Stroke Care. A questionnaire was completed by 1068 individuals 8-36 months after stroke. Perceived Life Satisfaction was measured with LiSat-9.Less than half of the participants were satisfied with life as a whole. For women, significant associations were found between not being satisfied with life as a whole and haemorrhage (odds ratio (OR) 4.00) as well as a deteriorated ability to concentrate (OR 2.11). For men, significant associations were found to be not having a significant other (OR 3.17), not working (OR 2.26) and deteriorated ability to concentrate (OR 2.04).There were different factors for being satisfied with life as a whole between men and women, indicating a need for a more gender-specific rehabilitation than is currently used. The impact that deteriorated ability to concentrate has on life satisfaction is an important finding that needs to be considered in the rehabilitation process of younger patients after stroke."Stroke	Epidemiology	"We describe the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors at stroke onset in men and women of all ages.A registry started in 2001, designed to register all hospitalized stroke patients in Denmark, now holds 40,102 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke. Patients underwent evaluation including stroke severity (Scandinavian Stroke Scale), CT, and cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, intermittent arterial claudication, previous myocardial infarction, body mass index, smoking, and alcohol consumption. We estimated the independent effect of gender and age on prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and calculated age and gender-specific prevalence rates for each risk factor.The register contained 47.9% women and 52.1% men. Men had more often diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction, intermittent arterial claudication, and over the limit alcohol consumption. Women had more often hypertension and obesity. Atrial fibrillation and smoking were equally frequent in both genders. Age stratification revealed that the lifestyle cardiovascular risk factors smoking, alcohol, and obesity were more common in the younger patients with stroke (< 60 years), whereas prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, intermittent arterial claudication, and, in men, also atrial fibrillation decreases in the elderly (> 70 to 80 years), the decrease being generally more pronounced in men than in women.Cardiovascular risk factors were generally more prevalent in men. Lifestyle cardiovascular risk factors were more common in the young. Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and, in men, also atrial fibrillation go down after the age of 70 to 80 years."Stroke	Outcomes	"PurposezzInterest in gender differences in the effects of acute stroke is growing worldwide. However, gender differences in functional recovery after acute stroke in the Korean population have yet to be evaluated. The aim of this investigation was to compare long-term functional outcomes between male and female after acute stroke.Patients with acute stroke were enrolled prospectively between January 2005 and January 2009. Baseline characteristics, risk factors, stroke subtypes, time delay from onset to arrival at a hospital, active treatment, and stroke severity were compared between male and female. Differences in mortality and disability at discharge, and at 3 months and 1 year after stroke onset were also investigated. Functional disabilities were categorized into two groups: good outcome (score on modified Rankin scale ‰ä_2) and poor outcome (score on modified Rankin scale >2).Among 1,055 patients with acute stroke, 575 were male (aged 64.83å±11.98 years, meanå±SD) and 480 were female (aged 70.09å±13.02 years). There were no gender differences in mortality at 3 months and 1 year after stroke. The frequency of poor outcomes was higher in female patients than in male patients at discharge (39.8% versus 30.9%, respectively; p=0.003), the 3 months follow-up (32.3% versus 20.8%, respectively; p<0.001), and the 1 year follow-up (31.1% versus 18.7%, respectively; p=0.001). After adjusting for multiple confounding factors including age and stroke severity, the female gender persisted as a predictor of poor functional outcome at 3 months and 1 year after stroke.Female patients have greater difficulty than male patients in recovering from a disabled state after acute stroke. Future studies should investigate the causes of this gender difference."Stroke	Clinical	"It is unclear whether individuals experience specific patterns of morbidity prior to premature death from cardiovascular disease (CVD).We examined morbidity levels in the 6 years leading up to death from CVD in 37,397 men and 113,198 women under 65 years of age from the Finnish Public Sector study, with a particular focus on gender differences. Morbidity was assessed using lost days from work, extracted from register data on sickness leave and disability pension. Data on cause-specific mortality were obtained from national health registers.During a median follow-up of 8.5 years, there were 361 CVD deaths (174 from ischaemic heart disease (ICD9 410-414, 427.5; ICD10 I21-I25, I46), 91 from stroke (ICD9 430, 431, 434; ICD10 I60-I60, I61, I63), and 96 from other diseases of circulatory system (ICD9 390-459; ICD10 I00-I99)). Women had lower morbidity than men over the 6 years preceding stroke deaths (RR for mean annual days=0.33 (95% CI 0.14-0.78)). For other causes of CVD mortality, there were no gender differences in morbidity rates prior to death. In men, those who died from CVD had substantially greater morbidity levels than matched controls through the entire 6-year period preceding death (rate ratio=3.59; 95% confidence interval 2.62-4.93). Among women, morbidity days were greater particularly in the year preceding death from stroke.Our results on working age men and women suggest no gender differences in morbidity prior to death from heart disease and lower morbidity in women prior to death from stroke. These findings challenge the widespread belief that women experience more morbidity symptoms than men."Stroke	Management	"To assess the gender differences in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with and without tissue plasminogen activator. The primary purpose is to evaluate for differences in baseline risk factors, treatment times, and 90-day outcomes. Data regarding gender differences in acute stroke treatment shows a delayed treatment and evaluation in women with stroke, associated with poorer outcome.Review of the University of California San Diego Specialized Program for Translational Research in Acute Stroke (SPOTRIAS) database from 2001 to 2009. All ""code stroke"" patients with the admitting diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke were classified based on gender and tissue plasminogen activator treatment (group 1 with tissue plasminogen activator, group 2 without).A total of 848 patients were included, group 1: 294 patients, baseline median NIHSS and mean age in men was 10 and 67.6+/-16.5 years, in women 13 and 72.4+/-16.5 years. group 2: 554 patients, baseline median NIHSS and mean age in men was 4 and 68.4+/-14.0 years, in women 5 and 72.2+/-14.0 years. Women and men had a similar tissue plasminogen activator treatment rate (women=38%, men=32%). Men were more likely to use tobacco and have a history of coronary artery disease and less likely to have a history of atrial fibrillation. In both groups, men had higher rates of a 90-day modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 1 compared to women (group 1 35.5% vs 22.6%; group 2 57.3% vs 47.3%). Multivariable analysis adjusting for observed confounders, namely admission NIHSS, coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation, indicate that this difference was not statistically significant. We found no significant difference between genders when assessing for treatment times in either group.Treatment times and patient outcomes after treatment for acute ischemic stroke were similar between genders. Previously identified gender differences in stroke treatment times and outcome were not found in our sample."Stroke	Outcomes	"It is generally believed that differences in age, stroke characteristics, and cardiovascular risk factors account for observed sex-specific differences in stroke survival.We aimed to study female stroke survival advantage before and after the average age of menopause, and whether female survival advantage applies only to patients for whom stroke is the most likely cause of death.The Danish National Indicator Project, a registry designed to list all hospitalized stroke patients in Denmark beginning in March 2001, had 40,155 registered patients as of February 2007. All registered patients had undergone evaluation including stroke severity (as measured by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale [SSS], using a total score of 0-58, in which lower scores indicate more severe strokes), computed tomography, and cardiovascular risk factors. Patients were followed from admission until death or censoring. Case fatality (stratified by 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year) in men and women was correlated with age and stroke severity. Adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors was performed by means of multivariate regression analysis.A total of 20,854 (51.9%) men and 19,301 (48.1%) women were registered. Women were significantly older than men at the time of stroke (74.5 vs 69.7 years, respectively; P < 0.001) and had signficantly more severe strokes, as expressed by the mean SSS score (39.6 vs 43.3; P < 0.001). Stratification of 1-week to 1-year case fatality according to age and stroke severity indicated that women survived significantly better than men from the mid-fifties onward, when controlling for age, stroke severity, and cardiovascular risk factor profile. The observed female survival advantage increased with age. The female survival advantage was seen in patients with severe as well as mild strokes, but not in those younger than age 50 years.Our findings dispute the effects of female sex hormones as the underlying cause of female survival superiority over men. Instead, we propose the hypothesis that the progressive deficiency of male sex hormones (testosterone), beginning in men in middle age, is the underlying cause of the gap in survival rates between men and women. Accordingly, the female survival advantage is rooted in male inferiority rather than innate female superiority."Stroke	Clinical	"Stroke prevention with carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic men with carotid stenosis is greater than in women. Men have a higher incidence of stroke <75 years of age. Sex differences in plaque characteristics may help explain this, because several plaque features, including a thin/ruptured fibrous cap, larger lipid-rich/necrotic core, and hemorrhage, are associated with increased risk of stroke. We hypothesize that MRI carotid plaque features will demonstrate sex differences indicative of higher-risk plaque in men.One hundred thirty-one patients (men, 67; women, 64) with >or=50% asymptomatic carotid stenosis on duplex ultrasound were included. Two blinded reviewers interpreted multicontrast MRI. Presence of a thin/ruptured fibrous cap, plaque components (lipid-rich/necrotic core, hemorrhage, and calcification), and percent component volume were documented. The associations between sex and individual plaque characteristics were examined using logistic and linear regression models (2-part models) controlling for demographic characteristics and MR angiographic findings.Presence of a thin/ruptured fibrous cap (48% versus 17%, adjusted OR=4.41, P<0.01) and lipid-rich/necrotic core (73% versus 50%, adjusted OR=3.66, P=0.01) were more common in men. There was a trend for more highly prevalent hemorrhage (33% versus, 17%, adjusted OR=2.15, P=0.07) in men. Calcification was not significantly associated with sex. Men demonstrated larger volumes of percent lipid-rich/necrotic core (median, 7.7% versus 3.2%, P=0.01), and percent hemorrhage (median, 6.1% versus 1.5%, P<0.01).In patients with asymptomatic >or=50% carotid stenosis by duplex ultrasound, men had higher-risk plaque features compared with women after controlling for potential confounders. These findings may help explain sex differences in stroke incidence and prevention."Stroke	Clinical	"Natural immunoglobulin M antibodies specific for phosphorylcholine (anti-PC) have been implicated in atherosclerosis. We have shown previously that high levels of anti-PC predict a slower progression of atherosclerosis in humans and that low levels of anti-PC are associated with higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Here we determine the association between anti-PC and the incidence of stroke.Using a nested case control study design, we examined 227 incident cases (125 men and 102 women) of first-time stroke and 455 age- and sex-matched controls identified during a 13-year time period (1985 to 1999) within the population-based cohorts of the VÌ_sterbotten Intervention Project (VIP) and the World Health Organization Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (WHO MONICA) project in Northern Sweden. Odds ratios of stroke with 95% CIs with adjustments for age, gender, smoking, serum cholesterol, diabetes, body mass index, and blood pressure were determined. Anti-PC levels were measured using ELISA.A significant association between low levels of anti-PC at baseline and incident stroke was seen for the whole group of anti-PC levels below the 30th percentile (multivariately adjusted odds ratio, 1.62; CI, 1.11 to 2.35). Analyses of gender-specific associations indicated fairly strong associations for females, especially at the lowest 30th percentile (multivariately adjusted odds ratio, 2.65; CI, 1.41 to 4.95). No associations were noted for men.Low anti-PC is a novel independent risk marker for development of stroke. Measurements of anti-PC could be used to identify immunodeficient subjects at an increased risk for stroke. The possibility that such subjects might be targets for novel modes of treatment such as immunotherapies deserves further investigation."Stroke	Review	"Ischemic stroke accounts for 87% of the 780,000 strokes occurring annually in the United States and is a leading cause of death and functional limitations worldwide. The prompt recognition of stroke symptoms and timely arrival at the emergency room are important to stroke outcomes. Recent literature was suggestive that women may have different stroke symptoms compared with men. If women have nontraditional symptoms at stroke onset, this may contribute to delay in diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this manuscript was to review the current literature regarding gender differences in stroke symptoms. Ten articles met the inclusion criteria for the review. Overall, the extant research was not indicative of robust gender differences in the classic symptoms of stroke or a greater frequency of nontraditional symptoms in women. One study found that women were significantly more likely than men to report nonspecific ""somatic"" symptoms, and in another study women were significantly more likely to have a change in mental status compared with men. Implications for nursing practice and suggestions for future research are discussed."Stroke	Outcomes	"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of cardiac autonomic derangement on gender-associated functional outcome of patients with subacute ischemic stroke undergoing a hospital-based rehabilitation program. The study population included 126 consecutive first-ever stroke survivors (mean age 59.7 +/- 11.6 years). Time-domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) by 24-hour Holter monitoring (HM) were considered in all cases. By the end of the rehabilitation program an unfavorable functional outcome with dependency (Barthel Index score of <75) was found in 27 men (40.3%) and in 31 women (52.5%; p = 0.168). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high age, low Barthel Index score and low Rankin Scale score on admission were independent predictors of an unfavorable functional outcome in both men and women. The standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals on HM was an independent predictor of rehabilitation outcome only in men (OR 15.29, 95% CI 2.47-46.58, p = 0.001). The presence of insular damage on neuroimaging studies was independently associated with an unfavorable functional outcome only in female (OR 18.89, 95% CI 2.34-71.4, p = 0.006). HRV does not predict functional outcome after rehabilitation in women. Instead, insular damage appears to have a role in determining the final results of rehabilitation in women but not in men."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Gender differences in life expectancy result in a higher proportion of women in the older population. This causes a female preponderance among elderly patients with ischaemic stroke. On the other hand, upper age limits are frequently used in clinical trials, in part due to safety reasons and logistical concerns. In this study, we model how applying upper age limits will lead to a gender disparity in stroke trials, favouring the inclusion of men rather than women.We analyzed a prospective hospital-based stroke registry covering the entire Federal State of Hesse, Germany. All cases with admission between 2003 and 2005 and a final diagnosis of ischaemic stroke (ICD10:I63) were selected. For various upper age limits (70, 75, 80, 85 and 90 years), we calculated the proportion of men and women excluded based on their age when applying the respective age span to the study population.A total of 34,754 patients were analyzed, and 17,748 (51%) hereof were women. Their mean age was 73.6 å± 12.1 years. The women were older than the men (76.8 å± 11.7 years vs. 70.2 å± 11.7 years; p < 0.001). All upper age limits provoked a significant gender disparity by leaving a higher proportion of female than male patients outside the admissible range. In particular, selecting 80 years as the upper age cut-off excluded 19% of all male patients but 44% of all female patients (p < 0.001).Setting an upper age limit for ischaemic stroke trials is likely not to be gender neutral but withholds a higher proportion of female than male patients from study participation. Investigators should be aware of such gender imbalances, which may involuntarily be transferred into routine clinical practice."Stroke	Outcomes	"The reasons for gender disparities in stroke outcome remain unclear, and little is known about the value of acute neuroimaging characteristics in elucidating differential stroke outcomes between the sexes.We prospectively evaluated consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. CT angiography (CTA) was performed in all patients within 24 h of symptom onset. CTA source images were used to evaluate lesion volume. The primary outcome measure was a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score ‰ä´ 3 at 6 months.We evaluated 676 consecutive patients (322 women). Women were older than men (p < 0.01), more frequently had a prestroke mRS >0 (p < 0.01), and had higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke scale scores (p = 0.01). More women had intracranial artery occlusions than men (46 vs. 33.1%, p = 0.01), but there was no significant difference between ischemic lesion volumes (p = 0.21). Using multiple regression, female gender remained an independent predictor of poor mRS scores at 6 months (odds ratio 1.57; 95% confidence interval 1.02-2.36) after adjustment for clinical and imaging covariates.Compared with men, women are less likely to achieve independence after acute ischemic stroke. The disparity in stroke outcome is not explained by differences in ischemic lesion volume or the presence of intracranial artery occlusions."Stroke	Review	"Ischemic brain injury is increasingly recognized as progressing through non-identical mechanisms in the male vs female brain. It is increasingly accepted that women are protected from cerebrovascular disease relative to men even beyond their menopausal years, and that young boys have higher stroke rates than do girls. The biological basis for this sexual dimorphism in epidemiology of ischemic brain injury, and less clearly in its outcome, is only partially known. However, both hormone-dependent and hormone-independent factors are likely involved, the latter of which is emphasized in this chapter. Understanding the molecular and cell-based mechanisms underlying sex differences in ischemic brain injury is an important step toward designing more effective therapeutic interventions and molecular targets in stroke."Stroke	Management	"The extent and implications of age- and sex-related differences in prophylaxis following ischemic stroke are unknown. We examined differences in the use of medical prophylaxis across age and sex groups in stroke patients after hospital discharge in Denmark and estimated the possible impact on age- and sex-related differences in mortality.A nationwide population-based follow-up study was conducted involving 28,634 patients hospitalized for ischemic stroke in 2003-2006 who survived 30 days after discharge. The proportion of patients who filled prescriptions for cardiovascular drugs within 0-6 and 12-18 months after discharge was determined. Mortality rates were compared across age and sex groups with and without controlling for use of medical prophylaxis.Increasing age was associated with lower prophylaxis. Adjusted odds ratios for the use of a combination of a platelet inhibitor, an antihypertensive and a statin were 0.45 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38-0.54] and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.43-0.62) for men and women >80 years, respectively, compared with men ‰ä_65 years. No systematic sex-related differences were identified. Continued drug use ranged from 66.1 to 91.9% for different drugs 12-18 months after discharge, with the lowest rate of continued use found among patients >80 years. Controlling for use of medical prophylaxis was associated with lower mortality rate ratios for elderly compared with younger patients.Continuous efforts are warranted to ensure implementation of evidence-based secondary prophylaxis among elderly patients with ischemic stroke."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Family history is a risk factor for stroke. The objective of this study was to investigate whether stroke subtypes and gender might have a familial contribution to stroke.Detailed family history analysis was used to investigate the parents or siblings of the probands and controls who were classified into 3 groups: probands, outpatient controls, and spouse controls. The lifetime risk (LTR) of stroke was estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model.The 684 probands and controls yielded 1066 parents and 3247 siblings. Compared to the parents and siblings of the controls, those of the stroke patients had a significantly higher LTR. The findings were consistent between probands with cerebral infarction (CI) or cerebral hemorrhage (CH), independent of diabetes, hypertension, and smoking. With regard to gender, family history of stroke was significant for both parents and siblings of the CH or CI patients, but not for the fathers of CI patients and sisters of CH patients. The family history of stroke was associated with an increased risk of stroke of all subtypes, except cardioembolism.This study supported the familial contribution to stroke in the case of both CI and CH but not cardioembolism, independent of the established risk factors for stroke. Gender differences in familial clustering of stroke subtypes were also revealed. These results warrant further molecular genetic studies."Stroke	Management	"This paper is a report of a study conducted to explore, from a gender perspective, older people's experiences of nursing care after a stroke.Little attention has been given to gender differences in nursing care. The majority of people who have a stroke are older. Improving knowledge of the gender perspectives of older men and women regarding nursing care after stroke is crucial.This was a qualitative study based on interviews with five women and five men between 66 and 75 years of age, who had received nursing care at a ward for stroke rehabilitation. The data were collected in 2006. Qualitative content analysis of the interviews was carried out.A main theme and five categories, all common to both men and women, were identified. The main theme, to promote recovery of the body, encompassed the categories. There were, however, gender differences in how the nursing care received was experienced. The ways patients experienced nursing care seemed to be linked with their lives as women and men before they had the stroke. Their perceptions are linked with their lives as women and men before they had their stroke. Both men and women will reclaim former abilities but what they perceive to be the goals of nursing care and rehabilitation may differ.Nurses need to increase their awareness and knowledge concerning the similarities and gender differences in the experiences and needs of older people, both men and women."Stroke	Review	"Depression after stroke occurs in 33% of individuals. It is grossly underdiagnosed and untreated.The authors studied sex differences in the prevalence of post-stroke depression (PSD), which have not been adequately studied, and may have important implications for clinicians.The authors performed a systematic review of five databases of all observational studies that stratified data by sex, measuring the prevalence of PSD.Fifty-six publications, including 47 primary studies between 1982 and 2006, met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. A total of 75,131 subjects comprised these studies, with 11,910 women and 62,899 men.The prevalence of depression among women was higher in 35 studies. Moreover, the prevalence was generally higher among inpatient populations (both in acute-care and rehabilitation facilities) than in community-dwelling subjects.PSD is highly prevalent in both sexes, but appears to be slightly more common among women than men. Untreated depression after stroke can lead to a reduced quality of life, poorer prognosis, and increased mortality. All stroke patients should be routinely screened for depression, and further research is needed to determine whether there are sex-specific differences in response to treatment."Stroke	Outcomes	"The female sex is associated with increased stroke severity and relatively poor functional recovery. Several studies have demonstrated that women with stroke benefit more from intravenous thrombolysis compared with men, while others found the nullification of gender effect among women treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). The purpose of our study was to determine any gender differences in the efficacy and safety of systemic thrombolysis among patients with acute ischemic stroke in Serbia.Data were from the Serbian experience with intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke (SETIS) study, a prospective, ongoing, multicenter, open, and observational study in Serbia of all patients who have received rtPA for acute ischemic stroke. We analyzed sex differences in the baseline characteristics, functional outcome and treatment complications.Among 60 women and 96 men with stroke and treated with intravenous thrombolysis, we found that at day 90, no significant sex differences in excellent functional outcome (50.9% of women vs. 57.0% of men, p=0.5), favorable functional outcome (61.4% of women vs. 68.8% of men, p=0.38) or death (8.8% of women vs. 12.9% of men, p=0.60). These results were constant even after adjustments for age, severity of basal neurological deficit and onset to treatment time.There were no sex differences in functional outcome at 90 days after the stroke among patients treated with IV rtPA. This finding might confirm that thrombolytic therapy nullifies usual sex differences in stroke outcome and suggests that women with stroke may benefit more from rtPA treatment."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Over the past 5 years, experimental data have emerged that ischemia-induced cell death pathways may differ in males and females. Cell death in males is triggered by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor. We have previously shown that interference with this pathway benefits males but not females after an experimental stroke. In contrast, caspase activation may be the major pathway activated after ischemic injury in females. The aim of this study is to examine whether sex differences exist in caspase activation in adult mice after stroke and to determine if interference with stroke-induced caspase activation preferentially protects females.Focal stroke was induced by reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (90 minutes) in young and aging C57BL/6 mice of both sexes. The pan-caspase inhibitor, quinoline-Val-Asp(Ome)-CH2-O-phenoxy was administered at reperfusion. Histological outcomes were assessed 48 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Separate cohorts were used for protein analysis of key cell death proteins, including caspase-3, caspase-8, cytochrome C, and apoptosis-inducing factor.Drug-treated female mice had significantly decreased infarct volumes and improved neurological deficits after stroke compared to vehicle-treated mice. Quinoline-Val-Asp(Ome)-CH2-O-phenoxy administration had no effect in male mice. The expression of cytochrome C and nuclear caspase-8 levels were increased in females after stroke.Female mice had an early release of cytochrome C and enhanced caspase activation after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Caspase inhibition benefited females but not males. Sex differences exist in both the response to ischemic injury and the efficacy of neuroprotective agents."Stroke	Review	"Some studies report that women are less likely to receive IV rt-PA treatment for stroke than men. We undertook a meta-analysis to determine whether a sex disparity existed.We identified studies that reported sex-specific IV rt-PA treatment rates for acute stroke. Eligible studies included acute stroke admissions from single or multiple hospitals, registries, or administrative databases. Random effects odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated to quantify sex differences (females versus males) among all ischemic stroke admissions and among the eligible subgroup who arrived within 3 hours without contraindications. Study design and geographic location were explored as sources of heterogeneity.Eighteen studies were included. Study designs included single hospitals (n=5), multiple hospitals (n=6), registries (n=4), and administrative databases (n=3). The summary OR was 0.70 (95% CI=0.55 to 0.88) indicating that women had a 30% lower odds of receiving rt-PA treatment than men. However, substantial between-study variability existed. Among 13 hospital-based studies, the summary OR was 0.78 (95% CI=0.71 to 0.86) with no significant heterogeneity. Among the 3 administrative studies, the OR was 0.55 (95% CI=0.34 to 0.90) but with significant heterogeneity. Among 4 studies that included data on the eligible subgroup, women had a nonsignificant lower odds of treatment (OR=0.81, 95% CI=0.58 to 1.13).Despite the presence of significant between-study variation, women with acute stroke were consistently less likely to receive thrombolysis treatment compared with men. Further studies to explore the origins of this sex disparity are warranted."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"It is increasingly recognized that histological and functional outcomes after stroke are shaped by biologic sex. Emerging data suggests that ischemic cell death pathways are sexually dimorphic (Hurn, P., Vannucci, S., Hagberg, H. (2005) Adult or perinatal brain injury: does sex matter?. Stroke 36, 193-195 ; Lang, J.T., McCullough, L.D. (2008) Pathways to ischemic neuronal cell death: are sex differences relevant?. J. Transl. Med. 6). Reducing neuronal nitric oxide (NO) or poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP1) activation protects only the male brain (Hagberg, H., et al. PARP-1 gene disruption in mice preferentially protects males from perinatal brain injury. J. Neurochem. 90, 1068-1075 (2004)), and paradoxically enhances ischemic injury in females (McCullough, L.D., et al. Ischemic nitric oxide and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 in cerebral ischemia: male toxicity, female protection. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 25, 502-512 (2005)). In this study, we examined downstream mediators of NO/PARP activation to investigate possible mediators of ischemic sexual dimorphism. Nuclear translocation of Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) was equivalent in wild type males and females after stroke and was unaffected by estrogen exposure. Deletion of PARP1 led to a dramatic reduction in stroke-induced poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PAR) formation and AIF translocation in both sexes, yet ischemic damage was reduced only in males. Subsequent examination of AIF-deficient Harlequin mice demonstrated that male Harlequin mice had less PAR formation, reduced AIF translocation and less ischemic damage than male wild type mice. In contrast, female Harlequin mice had no neuroprotective effect of gene deletion despite robust reductions in PAR formation and AIF translocation. Although equivalent activation of this cell death pathway occurs in both sexes after ischemia, detrimental effects are only present in males. AIF translocation and PAR formation do not mediate ischemic injury in the female brain, therefore agents designed to reduce PARP1 activation are unlikely to benefit females."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for stroke, but whether there is differential gender-specific risk has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to explore the impact of gender on incidence and relative risks of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke among the diabetic population in Taiwan.In this study, 500,868 diabetic patients and 500,248 age matched and-sex-matched nondiabetic individuals were linked to inpatient claims (1997-2002) to identify hospitalizations for nontraumatic hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Incidence density was calculated with the Poisson assumption, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the cumulative incidence over a 6-year follow-up period. We also evaluated the relative hazards of stroke in relation to diabetes with the Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted with demographics and geographic regions.The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in diabetic women was less than that in diabetic men except in those aged > or =85, but the difference between male and female diabetic patients was less pronounced with ischemic stroke. The hazard ratios (HRs) of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke among diabetic women were increased by a magnitude of 1.2 and 1.32, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of diabetic men. Further age-stratified analysis indicated that young and middle-aged diabetic women tended to have higher HRs and that diabetic women aged <35 suffered from particularly high HRs (HR 7.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.81-32.75 for hemorrhagic stroke, and HR = 8.46, 95% CI 4.28-16.75 for ischemic stroke).There was a significant gender-diabetes interactive effect on the incidence of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Additionally, young Taiwanese diabetic patients were most vulnerable to an increased relative risk of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Comprehensive diabetic care with stroke prevention measures should be emphasized in young diabetic people in order to prevent premature disability."Stroke	Management	"The purpose of this study was to examine whether there are disparities in use of stroke secondary prevention services because disparities in stroke outcomes have been found among older adults, women, racial minorities, and within Stroke Belt states.Using the nationally-representative 2005 Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System, we examined self-reported use of 11 stroke secondary prevention services queried in the survey. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between service use and age, sex, race, and Stroke Belt state residence, controlling for other socio-demographic and health care access characteristics.Among 11 862 adults with a history of stroke, 16% were 80 or older, 54% were women, 13% were non-Hispanic black, and 23% lived within a Stroke Belt state. Overall service use varied: 31% reported poststroke outpatient rehabilitation, 57% regular exercise, 66% smoking cessation counseling, and 91% current use of antihypertensive medications. Age 80 or older was not associated with lower use of any of the 11 services. Women were less likely to report poststroke outpatient rehabilitation and regular exercise when compared with men (probability values <or=0.005); there were no sex-based differences in use of the 9 other services. Blacks were less likely to report pneumococcal vaccination when compared with whites, but were more likely to report poststroke outpatient rehabilitation (probability values <or=0.005); there were no race-based differences in use of the 9 other services. Stroke Belt state residence was not associated with lower use of any of the 11 services.Use of many stroke secondary prevention services was suboptimal. We did not find consistent age, sex, racial, or Stroke Belt state residence disparities in care."Stroke	Management	"The efficacy of adjusted-dose oral anticoagulant treatment (OAT) in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) is well documented. Available data show that AF patients are widely heterogeneous in terms of ischaemic stroke risk. The role of female gender as a predictor of stroke risk is inconsistent, in particular it is unclear if warfarin treatment is able to prevent stroke equally in both sexes. We performed a prospective study on 780 AF patients on OAT, followed by an Anticoagulation Clinic, to evaluate if female gender is a risk factor for stroke among patients on OAT and if the quality of anticoagulation is different between genders. No difference was found in relation to the quality of anticoagulation between genders (p=0.5). During follow-up 33 patients had major bleedings (rate 1.37 x 100 pt/yrs) but no difference was found between genders in bleeding risk. Forty patients had ischaemic events [rate 1.66 x 100 pt/yrs; males rate 1.2 x 100 pt/yrs; females rate 2.43 x 100 pt/yrs; p=0.042; relative risk (RR) of females vs. males 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-3.1); p= 0.004]. The higher rate of ischaemic events in females with respect to males was confirmed at Cox regression analysis after correction for age (p=0.009). In addition, strokes occurring in females were more disabling, and RR for severe and fatal stroke, defined according to Modified Rankin scale, of females vs. males was 3.1 (95% CI 1.3-6.5; p=0.001). In conclusion, our data show a higher risk of stroke in anticoagulated AF females with respect to males, despite a similar quality of anticoagulation."Stroke	Review	"Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the general population and especially in older women.The incidence of stroke differs between men and women of a range of ages, with a higher lifetime risk for women than men. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of increased risk of stroke. Use of exogenous estrogen, especially in vulnerable populations, increases stroke risk. Women and men have different responses to primary and secondary stroke prevention. Women may not be offered acute ischemic stroke treatment as frequently as men; and female stroke survivors have worse outcomes.Gender-related differences in stroke are attributed to the hormonal changes that women experience through their lifetime, diverse risk factors for stroke in men and women, and specific lifestyles, and comorbid conditions. Neurologists need to be aware of aspects of stroke that are particularly relevant to women."Stroke	Clinical	"We compared the diagnostic evaluation and outcome of ischemic stroke between men and women in large cohort of Polish patients.Our study included 1488 consecutive patients (755 women and 733 men) with ischemic stroke, treated in a single stroke unit between January 2002 and August 2007. We analyzed demographic factors, major risk factors for stroke, severity of neurological deficit on admission, diagnostic work-up performed during the hospital stay, and outcome on discharge.Women were older than men (70.9+/-13.7 vs 66.2+/-12.7 years; P<0.001) and had greater neurological deficit on admission (median NIHSS score: 7 [3-13] vs 5 [3-10]; P<0.001). They were also less likely to obtain good recovery on discharge (39.2% vs 49.9%; P<0.001). Carotid ultrasound and echocardiography were performed more often in men (77.2% vs 68.7% and 52.4% vs 46.5%, respectively; P<0.05). Lesser neurological deficit on admission, younger age, and lack of history of myocardial infarction or previous stroke, but not gender, were independent predictors of full diagnostic work-up.Gender does not influence the adequate diagnostic evaluation of ischemic stroke as an independent factor."Stroke	Outcomes	"Post-stroke levels of total cholesterol (TC) appear to be negatively associated with stroke mortality. Statin pretreatment might affect this association. Sex differences in the prognostic value of the lipid profile have not yet been studied. We have evaluated the impact of TC, high- and low-density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL, respectively), and triglyceride (TG) levels on the 3-month outcome after a first ischemic stroke (IS) according to sex and previous statin use. The study group consisted of a hospital-based cohort of consecutive patients with a diagnosis of first IS. Poor outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score >or=3 at 90 days. The odds ration (OR) for poor prognosis was analyzed for each sex using logistic regression models adjusted for vascular risk factors and statin pretreatment. A total of 591 patients were included in the analysis (318 men). The predictors of a 90-day poor outcome were age and initial NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score in women, and age, initial NIHSS, smoking, atrial fibrillation, and thrombolytic treatment in men. In women, none of the lipids studied affected the 90-day prognosis. Men falling in the last quintile of TC [OR: 0.68 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.52-0.88; p = 0.004] and LDL (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.98; p = 0.04) have better outcome than men in the first quintile. Adjusting for statin pretreatment did not change the results. The results indicated that an association between poststroke lipids and prognosis may vary by sex. In women, lipids were not associated with the outcome; in men, lower TC and LDL were associated with worse prognosis. These differences can not be explained by statin use and require further research."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at increased risk for stroke, cardiovascular events, and death, yet little is known about whether these risks differ for men and women. We determined whether there are sex-based differences in these outcomes 30 days and 1 year after TIA using a national sample of elderly patients.Rates of 30-day and 1-year hospitalization for TIA (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision Code 435), stroke (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision Codes 433, 434, and 436), coronary artery disease (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision Codes 410 to 414), all-cause readmission, and mortality were determined for fee-for-service Medicare patients >or=65 years of age discharged with a TIA in 2002. Cox proportional hazards models and random-effects logistic models compared outcomes with risk adjustment for demographics, medical history, comorbidities, and prior hospitalizations.The study included 122063 TIA hospitalizations (mean age, 79.0+/-7.6 years; 62% women; 86% white). Men were younger but had higher rates of cardiac comorbidities than women. Women had lower unadjusted rates of stroke, coronary artery disease, and mortality at 30 days and 1 year after TIA admission. These relationships persisted in risk-adjusted analyses at 30 days for stroke (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.77), coronary artery disease (hazard ratio, 0.86; 0.74 to 1.00), and mortality (odds ratio, 0.74; 0.68 to 0.82) as well as at 1 year for stroke (hazard ratio, 0.85; 0.81 to 0.89), coronary artery disease (hazard ratio, 0.81; 0.77 to 0.86), and mortality (odds ratio, 0.78; 0.75 to 0.81).These data suggest that women have a better prognosis than men within the first year after hospital discharge for a TIA. Additional research is needed to identify factors that may explain these sex-related differences in outcomes."Stroke	Clinical	"In a recent meta-analysis, women with stroke had 30% lower odds of receiving tissue plasminogen activator than did men, and some studies have reported greater in-hospital delays in women with stroke. Causes of these disparities are unclear but could result from a different symptom presentation in women. Our objective was to prospectively investigate gender differences in acute stroke symptoms.Ischemic stroke/TIA cases presenting to the University of Michigan Hospital (January 2005 to December 2007) were identified. Stroke/TIA symptoms, ascertained by patient interview, were classified as traditional or nontraditional (pain, mental status change, lightheadedness, headache, other neurological, nonneurological). Prevalence of any nontraditional symptom and of each symptom were calculated by gender. Logistic regression was used to compare nontraditional symptoms by gender adjusted for stroke vs TIA, proxy use, age, and discharge disposition (home vs other).Included were 461 cases (48.6% women; median age, 67). Among women, 51.8% reported >or=1 nontraditional stroke/TIA symptom compared to 43.9% of men (P=0.09). The most prevalent nontraditional symptom was mental status change (women, 23.2%; men, 15.2%; P=0.03). The odds of reporting at least 1 nontraditional stroke/TIA symptom were 1.42 times (95% CI, 0.97-2.06) greater in women than in men.A high prevalence of nontraditional symptoms among both genders was found, with women more likely to report nontraditional symptoms and, in particular, altered mental status, compared with men. Larger-scale studies focusing on stroke in women are warranted and could confirm gender differences in symptoms in a larger, more representative stroke population and address the clinical consequences."Stroke	Review	"The natural history of stroke is worse in women than in men. Controversial data have been published on the efficacy of thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) according to gender. We evaluated gender differences in the efficacy and safety outcomes of intravenous rtPA using a clinical registry and systematic review.Since January 2002, we collected baseline characteristics and efficacy and safety outcomes for patients who received intravenous rtPA in our center. We performed a systematic PubMed literature search for previous observational studies that examined gender effects on outcomes after intravenous rtPA treatment.No gender difference in good outcome at 3 months (adjusted OR for women, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.76 to 2.60) and in 90-day mortality (adjusted OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.59 to 3.19) was found in our registry. We identified 16 studies that evaluated the gender effect among intravenous rtPA-treated patients. None of these studies supported a gender difference in favorable outcome, and one suggested an increased risk of mortality in men. In unadjusted partial meta-analysis in 4074 women and 5840 men including our registry data, we found a trend toward a lower risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in women (crude OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.10).These results suggest no gender difference in outcome among patients treated with intravenous rtPA."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Differences between women and men in relation to stroke are increasingly being recognized.From July 2004 until June 2007, 237 acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients were treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within 3 hours after onset of symptoms in our stroke unit. Baseline characteristics, etiology, CT/MRI stroke patterns, clinical outcome, and complications of women were compared to those of men.Of 237 AIS patients (mean age 70.7 years), 111 (46.8%) were women and 126 (53.2%) were men. Women were older (P=0.001), but history of hyperlipidemia (P=0.03), smoking (P=0.03), and coronary heart disease (P<0.001) was less frequent than in men. Internal carotid artery disease occurred more often in men (P=0.02), whereas atrial fibrillation was observed more often in women (P=0.002). In men borderzone/small embolic and lacunar stroke was found more frequently (39.7 versus 27.2%), whereas women showed a higher percentage of large territorial stroke (72.8 versus 60.3%, P=0.09). Baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores (12.5 versus 11.3), NIHSS score at discharge (11.0 versus 9.5), 3-month-outcome modified Rankin Scale score, thrombolysis-related (17.1% versus 13.5%) or independent complications (32.4% versus 30.2%), and mortality after 3 months (13.5% versus 9.5%) were similar.Differences of stroke lesion patterns in genders are paralleled by differences in etiology and risk factor profiles (women, cardioembolism; men, large and small vessel disease). Baseline characteristics, rates of rtPA-related and independent complications, as well as clinical outcomes were not different between women and men with AIS."Stroke	Review	"Stroke is the third most common cause of death in women and a major cause of disability. Many aspects of stroke are similar in men and women, including clinical presentation, main risk factors, and distribution of the main subtypes. There are, however, some gender differences and specificities in stroke including some aspects related to treatment. Women are less likely to receive thrombolysis than men; however, in treated cases, the efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis is higher in women than in men. Hormone replacement therapy has been suggested as a possible strategy to reduce the occurrence of stroke in postmenopausal women but several clinical trials failed to show any benefit in stroke and cardiovascular disease prevention. Also in stroke prevention with antiplatelets there emerge some important gender differences: in primary prevention of stroke, aspirin was effective in women but not in men while in secondary prevention no gender differences were found with any of the available antiplatelet agents."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"The gender differences in stroke risk among diabetic patients with different treatments have not been studied previously. We aim to determine if there is a gender difference in nonfatal stroke risk in diabetic patients receiving different types of glucose-lowering treatments.In December 2005, data of type 2 diabetic patients were extracted from a nationwide population-based diabetes registry covering 11 Ukrainian regions. Male/female odds ratios (OR) for nonfatal stroke were calculated in three treatment groups: diet only 7,273/15,901, oral glucose-lowering drugs 15,109/33,913, and insulin 5,529/12,462 male/female. Male/female ORs of stroke were estimated using a logistic regression model.The age-adjusted ORs of stroke were higher among diabetic men compared with diabetic women with oral glucose-lowering drug treatment (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.22-1.54) and diet treatment only (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.35-1.73). No differences were found among patients who used insulin (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84-1.11). Further adjustment for duration of type 2 diabetes, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and smoking affected the results only slightly.The gender risks of nonfatal stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes appear to differ considerably depending on treatment types."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Previous studies suggested a male predominance in childhood ischemic stroke, mirroring gender differences in adults but were limited by small sample sizes or unconfirmed diagnoses. We sought to study gender within a large international series of confirmed cases of pediatric ischemic stroke.From January 2003 to July 2007, the International Pediatric Stroke Study enrolled children (0 up to 19 years) with arterial ischemic stroke or cerebral sinovenous thrombosis at 30 centers in 10 countries. Neonates were those <29 days of age. We calculated the ""expected"" gender ratio for our study as the weighted average of population-based childhood gender ratios in enrolling countries weighted by the number of subjects enrolled in each country. chi(2) tests were used to compare the observed gender ratios in our series with this expected ratio (51.7%).Among 1187 children with confirmed ischemic stroke, 710 were boys (60%, P<0.0001). Male predominance persisted after stratification by age (61% for neonates, P=0.011; 59% for later childhood, P=0.002) and stroke subtype (58% for arterial ischemic stroke, P=0.004; 65% for cerebral sinovenous thrombosis, P=0.002). The greatest proportion of males occurred among children with arterial ischemic stroke and a history of trauma (75%, P=0.008), although boys were also overrepresented among those with arterial ischemic stroke and no trauma (57%; P=0.07). There were no gender differences in case fatality or deficits at discharge.Childhood ischemic stroke appears to be more common in boys regardless of age, stroke subtype, or history of trauma. Further exploration of this gender difference could shed light on stroke mechanisms in both children and adults."Stroke	Management	"The metabolic syndrome (MetS) might confer a higher resistance to intravenous thrombolysis in acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke. MetS increases the risk of stroke in women to a greater extent than in men. We aimed to investigate whether there might be sex differences in the impact of MetS on the response to intravenous thrombolysis for acute MCA ischemic stroke.We prospectively studied consecutive ischemic stroke patients, treated with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator according to SITS-MOST criteria, with an MCA occlusion on prebolus transcranial Doppler examination. Resistance to thrombolysis was defined as the absence of complete MCA recanalization 24 hours after tissue-type plasminogen activator infusion by transcranial Doppler criteria. MetS was diagnosed according to the criteria established by the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 2005 statement.A total of 125 patients (75 men, 50 women; mean age, 67.6+/-11 years) were included. MetS was diagnosed in 76 (61%) patients. Resistance to clot lysis at 24 hours was observed in 53 (42%) patients. Two multivariate-adjusted, logistic-regression models identified that MetS was associated with a higher resistance to tissue-type plasminogen activator, independently of other significant baseline variables (odds ratio=9.8; 95% CI, 3.5 to 27.8; P=0.0001) and of the individual components of the MetS. The MetS was associated with a significantly higher odds of resistance to thrombolysis in women (odds ratio=17.5; 95% CI, 1.9 to 163.1) than in men (odds ratio=5.1; 95% CI, 1.6 to 15.6; P for interaction=0.0004).The effect of MetS on the resistance to intravenous thrombolysis for acute MCA ischemic stroke appears to be more pronounced in women than in men."Stroke	Management	"Carotid endarterectomy is performed less often in women than in men, but it is unknown whether this reflects differences in screening rates, disease prevalence, or other factors.This was a cohort study of consecutive patients with acute stroke or TIA admitted to 11 Ontario stroke centers participating in the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network between July 1, 2003, and September 30, 2007. We compared rates of carotid imaging, the severity of carotid stenosis, and rates of carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty within 6 months of the index event in women vs men.We studied 6,389 patients (48% women) with ischemic stroke or TIA. Women were less likely than men to undergo carotid imaging (81% vs 86%, p < 0.0001); however, when the analysis was limited to patients without apparent contraindications to surgery, 92% received carotid imaging, with no difference between women and men. Women were less likely than men to have severe carotid stenosis (7.4% vs 11.5%, p < 0.0001). Women were half as likely as men to undergo carotid revascularization within 6 months of the index event (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 0.70), but this gender difference was no longer significant in the subgroup with severe carotid stenosis (odds ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 1.15).Although women with ischemic stroke or TIA are less likely than men to undergo carotid screening and revascularization, this difference is largely explained by potential contraindications to surgery and by sex differences in the severity of carotid disease."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Previous studies have indicated a male predominance in pediatric stroke. To elucidate this gender disparity, total testosterone concentration was measured in children with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS; n = 72), children with cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT; n = 52), and 109 healthy controls. Testosterone levels above the 90th percentile for age and gender were documented in 10 children with AIS (13.9%) and 10 with CSVT (19.2%), totaling 16.7% of patients with cerebral thromboembolism overall, as compared with only 2 of 109 controls (1.8%; p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis with adjustment for total cholesterol level, hematocrit, and pubertal status, elevated testosterone was independently associated with increased disease risk (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: overall = 3.98 [1.38-11.45]; AIS = 3.88 [1.13-13.35]; CSVT = 5.50 [1.65-18.32]). Further adjusted analyses revealed that, for each 1nmol/l increase in testosterone in boys, the odds of cerebral thromboembolism were increased 1.3-fold."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Males exhibit greater histologic and behavioral impairment after stroke than do age-matched females. However, the contribution of androgens to stroke outcome remains unclear. We compared outcomes from middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in castrated mice with those in testosterone- or dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-replaced castrated mice. Castrates treated with 1.5 mg testosterone or 0.5 mg DHT before MCAO showed smaller infarct volumes (hemisphere: 27 or 26%) at 24 h after 90 mins MCAO than did untreated castrates (37%), whereas 5 mg testosterone or 1.5 mg DHT exacerbated infarcts (53 or 51%). These outcomes were blocked by the androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide, suggesting that androgen receptors mediate these responses to ischemia. We further evaluated long-term outcomes with a milder 60-min MCAO in castrates treated with the protective 1.5 mg testosterone dose. Consistent with data obtained at 24 h reperfusion, the infarct volume was decreased at 9 days reperfusion. Neurobehavioral analysis showed that motor functional recovery was improved during the first 3 days of reperfusion, but not improved at 7 days. We conclude that testosterone exhibits dose-dependent and time-sensitive effects after ischemia and that testosterone is likely to be an important factor in sex-linked differences in cerebrovascular disease."Stroke	Review	"Gender differences in stroke outcome have implicated steroid hormones as potential neuroprotective candidates. However, no clinical trials examining hormone replacement therapy on outcome following ischemic stroke have investigated the effect of progesterone-only treatment. In this review the authors examine the experimental evidence for the neuroprotective potential of progesterone and give an insight into potential mechanisms of action following ischemic stroke. To date, 17 experimental studies have investigated the neuroprotective potential of progesterone for ischemic stroke in terms of ability to both reduce cell loss and increase functional outcome. Of these 17 published studies the majority reported a beneficial effect with three studies reporting a nil effect and only one study reporting a negative effect. However, there are important issues that the authors address in this review in terms of the methodological quality of studies in relation to the STAIR recommendations. In terms of the proposed mechanisms of progesterone neuroprotection we show that progesterone is versatile and acts at multiple targets to facilitate neuronal survival and minimize cell damage and loss. A large amount of experimental evidence indicates that progesterone is a neuroprotective candidate for ischemic stroke; however, to progress to clinical trial a number of key experimental studies remain outstanding."Stroke	Review	"Epidemiological studies, mainly based on Western European surveys, have shown that stroke is more common in men than in women. In recent years, sex-specific data on stroke incidence, prevalence, subtypes, severity and case-fatality have become available from other parts of the world. The purpose of this article is to give a worldwide review on sex differences in stroke epidemiology.We searched PubMed, tables-of-contents, review articles, and reference lists for community-based studies including information on sex differences. In some areas, such as secular trends, ischemic subtypes and stroke severity, noncommunity-based studies were also reviewed. Male/female ratios were calculated.We found 98 articles that contained relevant sex-specific information, including 59 incidence studies from 19 countries and 5 continents. The mean age at first-ever stroke was 68.6 years among men, and 72.9 years among women. Male stroke incidence rate was 33% higher and stroke prevalence was 41% higher than the female, with large variations between age bands and between populations. The incidence rates of brain infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage were higher among men, whereas the rate of subarachnoidal hemorrhage was higher among women, although this difference was not statistically significant. Stroke tended to be more severe in women, with a 1-month case fatality of 24.7% compared with 19.7% for men.Worldwide, stroke is more common among men, but women are more severely ill. The mismatch between the sexes is larger than previously described."Stroke	Management	"Previous studies report that women with stroke may experience longer delays in diagnostic workup than men after arriving at the emergency department. We hypothesized that presenting symptom differences could explain these delays.Data were collected on 1922 acute stroke cases who presented to 15 hospitals participating in a statewide stroke registry. We evaluated 2 in-hospital time intervals: emergency department arrival to physician examination (""door-to-doctor"") and emergency department arrival to brain imaging (""door-to-image""). We used parametric survival models to estimate time ratios, which represent the ratio of average times comparing women to men, after adjusting for symptom presentation and other confounders.Women were significantly less likely than men to present with any stroke warning sign or suspected stroke (87.5% versus 91.4%) or to report trouble with walking, balance, or dizziness (9.5% versus 13.7%). Difficulty speaking and loss of consciousness were associated with shorter door-to-doctor times. Weakness, facial droop, difficulty speaking, and loss of consciousness were associated with shorter door-to-image times, whereas difficulty with walking/balance was associated with longer door-to-image times. In adjusted analyses, women had 11% longer door-to-doctor intervals (time ratio, 1.11; 95%, CI 1.02 to 1.22) and 15% longer door-to-image intervals (time ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.25) after accounting for presenting symptoms, age, and other confounders. Furthermore, these sex differences remained evident after restricting to patients who arrived within 6 or within 2 hours of symptom onset.Women with acute stroke experienced greater emergency department delays than men, which were not attributable to differences in presenting symptoms, time of arrival, age, or other confounders."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Minocycline is neuroprotective in clinical and experimental stroke studies, due in part to its ability to inhibit poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Previous preclinical data have shown that interference with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase signaling leads to sex-specific neuroprotection, reducing stroke injury only in males. In this study, we show that minocycline is ineffective at reducing ischemic damage in females after middle cerebral artery occlusion, likely due to effects on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase signaling. Clinical trials must consider possible sex differences in the response to neuroprotective agents, if we hope to translate promising therapies to stroke patients of both sexes."Stroke	Outcomes	"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of sex across different age groups and over time for stroke incidence, 30-day case-fatality, and mortality.All first hospitalizations for stroke in Scotland (1986 to 2005) were identified using linked morbidity and mortality data. Age-specific rate ratios (RRs) for comparing women with men for both incidence and mortality were modeled with adjustment for study year and socioeconomic deprivation. Logistic regression was used to model 30-day case-fatality.Women had a lower incidence of first hospitalization than men and size of effect varied with age (55 to 64 years, RR=0.65, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.66; >or=85 years, RR=0.94, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.96). Women aged 55 to 84 years had lower mortality than men and again size of effect varied with age (65 to 74 years, RR=0.79, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.81); 75 to 84 years, RR=0.94, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.95). Conversely, women aged >or=85 years had 15% higher stroke mortality than men (RR=1.15, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.18). Adjusted risk of death within 30 days was significantly higher in women than men, and this difference increased over the 20-year period in all age groups (adjusted OR in 55 to 64 year olds 1.23, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.33 in 1986 and 1.51, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.63 in 2005).We observed lower rates of incidence and mortality in younger women than men. However, higher numbers of older women in the population mean that the absolute burden of stroke is greater in women. Short-term case-fatality is greater in women of all ages and, worryingly, these differences have increased from 1986 to 2005."Stroke	Outcomes	"Sex may predict level of care and successive outcome among patients with stroke. We examined fulfillment of quality of care criteria according to sex and possible impact of any sex-related differences on short-term mortality in a population-based nationwide follow-up study in Denmark.We identified 29 549 patients admitted with stroke between January 2003 and October 2005 in the Danish National Indicator Project. Data on 30- and 90-day mortality were obtained from The Civil Registration System. We compared proportions of patients receiving adequate care between sexes, as measured by admission to a specialized stroke unit, administration of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, examination with CT/MRI scan, and assessment by a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, and of nutritional risk. Further, we computed 30- and 90-day mortality rate ratios (MRR), adjusted for patient characteristics, fulfillment of quality of care criteria, and department.The proportion of patients who received adequate care was either slightly lower or similar among women when compared to men. The relative risks (RR) of receiving specific components of care ranged from 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI]:0.74 to 0.96) to 1.01 (95% CI:0.96 to 1.06) when comparing sexes. The adjusted mortality rate ratios were lower among women and adjustment for fulfillment of quality of care criteria had only marginal impact.There appear not to be any substantial sex-related differences in acute hospital care among patients with stroke in Denmark. The lower female short-term mortality is therefore most likely explained by other factors."Stroke	Management	"Prior studies have suggested worse poststroke outcomes in women. We sought to examine sex differences in quality of care (QOC) in the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) program.We analyzed the relationships between sex and QOC as well as outcomes (in-hospital mortality and discharge home) using multivariable logistic regression models in 383 318 acute ischemic stroke admissions from 1139 hospitals that participated in the GWTG-Stroke program between 2003 to 2008. QOC was measured using 7 predefined performance measures and a defect-free care summary measure (defined as the proportion of patients who received all eligible interventions).Compared to men, women were older and more likely to present by ambulance. They were also more likely to have a past medical history of atrial fibrillation or hypertension, and less likely to have a history of heart disease, dyslipidemia, or smoking. Although sex differences in individual performance measures were relatively modest they consistently identified women as being less likely to receive care compared to men. Overall, women received less defect-free care than men (66.3% versus 71.1%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 0.87) and were less likely to be discharged home (41.0% versus 49.5%, aOR=0.84, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.85). Although crude mortality was higher in women (6.0% versus 5.2%), this difference was eliminated after risk adjustment (aOR=1.03, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.06).Quality of care for women with ischemic stroke was lower than that for men, and women were less likely to be discharged home. Further study is warranted to identify the causes and consequences of these sex-based differences in care."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability in the elderly. Age is the most important nonmodifiable risk factor for stroke, yet many preclinical models continue to examine only young male animals. It remains unclear how experimental stroke outcomes change with aging and with biologic sex. If sex differences are present, it is not known whether these reflect an intrinsic differing sensitivity to stroke or are secondary to the loss of estrogen with aging. We subjected both young and aging mice of both sexes to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Young female mice had smaller strokes compared with age-matched males, an effect that was reversed by ovariectomy. Stroke damage increased with aging in female mice, whereas male mice had decreased damage after MCAO. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability changes are correlated with infarct size. However, aging mice had significantly less edema formation, an effect that was independent of sex and histologic damage. Differences in the cellular response to stroke occur across the life span in both male and female mice. These differences need to be considered when developing relevant therapies for stroke patients, the majority of whom are elderly."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Gender differences in stroke are matters of increasing interest. The American Stroke Association's patient management tool, Get with the Guidelines-Stroke (GGS) is widely used to increase adherence to quality indicators in stroke care, but it also provides an opportunity to analyze gender differences in the acute stroke setting.We used a state-wide database, based on GGS, to explore gender differences in stroke in Colorado. We analyze demographics, risk factors, lifestyles, treatments, and responses to treatment.Of 126 data elements examined, statistically significant gender differences were noted for 47 (37%). As compared to men, women in Colorado were older and more significantly impacted by acute stroke. Risk factor profiles differed between the 2 genders, with men having a higher incidence of coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, carotid stenosis and tobacco smoking, while women had a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Lipids were less aggressively treated and antithrombotics were less commonly used in women. Overall, acute stroke treatment of women appeared ""less aggressive"" than for men.GGS may be used not only for quality improvement initiatives in individual hospitals. It can also give an overview of clinical aspects of stroke at a state level, and may shed light on gender differences."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Stroke is emerging as a major public health problem for women, as it is for men. Controversy persists regarding gender differences in stroke incidence, severity, and poststroke disability.Participants in the Framingham Original (n=5119; 2829 women) and Offspring (n=4957, 2565 women) cohorts who were 45 years and stroke-free were followed to first incident stroke. Gender-specific outcome measures were adjusted for the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile components.We observed 1136 incident strokes (638 in women) over 56 years of follow-up. Women were significantly (P<0.001) older (75.1 versus 71.1 years for men) at their first-ever stroke, had a higher stroke incidence above 85 years of age, lower at all other ages, and a higher lifetime risk of stroke at all ages. There was no significant difference in stroke subtype, stroke severity, and case fatality rates between genders. Women were significantly (P<0.01) more disabled before stroke and in the acute phase of stroke in dressing (59% versus 37%), grooming (57% versus 34%), and transfer from bed to chair (59% versus 35%). At 3 to 6 months poststroke women were more disabled, more likely to be single, and 3.5 times more likely to be institutionalized (P<0.01).These results from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) support the existence of gender-differences in stroke incidence, lifetime risk (LTR) of stroke, age at first stroke, poststroke disability, and institutionalization rates. Prestroke disability and sociodemographic factors may contribute to the high rate of institutionalization and poorer outcome observed in women."Stroke	Clinical	"Prompt recognition of stroke symptoms is critical to timely treatment and women have increased delay to treatment. Women may be more likely to present with atypical symptoms, but this hypothesis has not been extensively evaluated.We examined gender differences in the prevalence of presenting and prodromal stroke symptoms among 1107 consecutive patients hospitalized with neurologist-confirmed acute ischemic stroke. Patient demographics, clinical variables, and stroke symptoms were abstracted from medical records by trained abstractors using standardized forms. Estimates were age-standardized to the age distribution of men and women combined. Presenting symptoms occurred within 24 hours of incident stroke admission; prodromal symptoms occurred >or=24 hours of admission.Women were significantly older (P<0.001), more likely to have cardioembolic stroke (P<0.01), and less likely to receive aspirin (P=0.014) or statins (P<0.001). Thirty-five percent of the sample (n=389) reported prodromal symptoms. Women were more likely to have >or=1 somatic prodromal and presenting symptoms (P=0.03; P=0.008), but did not differ from men on specific somatic symptoms. Women did not differ from men in classic presenting stroke symptoms (P=0.89).Women did not differ significantly in the prevalence of traditional stroke symptoms but were more likely to have somatic presenting and prodromal symptoms. We found no differences in specific prodromal symptoms, making it difficult to craft a public health message about gender differences in early warning signs of stroke. These results suggest that the focus of stroke prevention education for women should continue to emphasize traditional stroke risk factors."Stroke	Review	"We systematically reviewed the literature to explore gender issues in acute stroke thrombolysis. The literature is inconsistent regarding the influence of gender on the timing of presentation to hospital, decision-making and utilization of acute thrombolysis among ischemic stroke patients, and hence any reported gender bias may be site-specific. Without treatment with thrombolysis, female stroke patients have a poorer clinical outcome compared to their male counterparts. Although some studies show that women have better clinical outcomes than men following intravenous thrombolysis, no gender difference is seen in others. Post-hoc analyses of relatively small studies show higher recanalisation rates in women than men following intravenous thrombolysis, and no gender difference in recanalisation rates following intra-arterial thrombolysis. Future thrombolytic trials should consider the effects of gender on both surrogate and clinical outcomes."Stroke	Clinical	"Differences in the management of women and men with acute coronary symptoms are well documented, but relatively little is known about practices for patients with ischemic stroke. We sought to determine whether there are sex-associated differences in the utilization of diagnostic tests for ischemic stroke patients treated at academic hospitals in the United States.Medical records were abstracted for consecutive ischemic stroke patients admitted to 32 US academic medical centers from January through June, 2004, as part of the University HealthSystem Consortium Ischemic Stroke Benchmarking Project. We compared the utilization rates of diagnostic tests including neuroimaging (CT or MRI), electrocardiogram (ECG), ultrasound of the carotid arteries, and echocardiography (transthoracic or transesophageal) for women and men. Multivariate logistic regression was used to test for sex differences with adjustment for potential confounders.The study included 1,256 ischemic stroke patients (611 women; 645 men; mean age 66.6 +/- 14.6 years; 56% white). There were no differences between women and men in the use of neuroimaging (odds ratio, OR = 1.37; 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.58-3.24), ECG (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.70-1.44), carotid artery ultrasound (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.72-1.21) or echocardiography (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.70-1.22). The results were similar after covariate adjustment.Women and men admitted to US academic hospitals receive comparable diagnostic evaluations, even after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors."Stroke	Management	"We evaluated whether there were sex-related differences in the administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) to patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to US academic medical centers.Medical records were abstracted for consecutive ischemic stroke patients admitted to 32 academic medical centers from January through June, 2004, as part of the University HealthSystem Consortium Ischemic Stroke Benchmarking Project. Multivariate logistic models were used to test for sex-related differences in the receipt of IV-tPA with adjustment for demographic and clinical factors.The study included 1,234 patients (49% women; mean age 66.6 years; 56% white). IV-tPA was given to 7% (6.5% of women versus 7.5% of men, p = 0.49). Women and men were equally likely to receive IV-tPA in risk-adjusted analyses (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.64-1.64). Approximately 77% of women and men who did not receive IV-tPA did not meet the 3-hour treatment window or their time of onset was unknown.Women admitted to academic hospitals receive IV-tPA as often as men; however, a substantial percentage of both women and men are not arriving within the 3-hour time window required for diagnostic assessment and administration of intravenous thrombolytic therapy. Additional efforts are needed to improve the rapid identification, evaluation and treatment of stroke patients."Stroke	Review	"Biological sex is an important determinant of stroke risk and outcome. Women are protected from cerebrovascular disease relative to men, an observation commonly attributed to the protective effect of female sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone. However, sex differences in brain injury persist well beyond the menopause and can be found in the pediatric population, suggesting that the effects of reproductive steroids may not completely explain sexual dimorphism in stroke. We review recent advances in our understanding of sex steroids (estradiol, progesterone and testosterone) in the context of ischemic cell death and neuroprotection. Understanding the molecular and cell-based mechanisms underlying sex differences in ischemic brain injury will lead to a better understanding of basic mechanisms of brain cell death and is an important step toward designing more effective therapeutic interventions in stroke."Stroke	Outcomes	"Recent studies have demonstrated gender differences in functional outcome after stroke. However, the underlying reasons for differences have been inconsistent. The present study examined whether gender differences in long-term functional outcomes exist among surviving patients with first-ever ischemic stroke and with individual subtypes of stroke.A total of 997 patients (654 men, 343 women) were followed for 5 years after discharge. Patients were assigned to 4 subtypes of ischemic stroke (atherothrombotic, lacunar, cardioembolic and unclassified infarction). Functional outcomes were expressed as locomotor activity, assessed using a questionnaire delivered by mail 1 and 5 years after stroke. Locomotor function was classified into 5 categories according to the grade of disability.Women showed significantly worse locomotor function than men at both 1 and 5 years (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, significant gender differences in functional outcome were observed in all subtypes of ischemic stroke at 1 and 5 years after stroke. Logistic regression analysis revealed that gender was a significant determinant for functional outcome at 1 and 5 years after stroke (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). No significant gender difference was seen in the rate of stroke recurrence. Women also showed a worse survival ratio after stroke than men (p < 0.01).The present study demonstrated significantly worse functional outcomes for women than for men at 1 and 5 years after stroke. Gender differences in long-term functional outcomes by subtypes of ischemic stroke were also significant."Stroke	Outcomes	"We aimed to determine gender differences in outcomes and mortality in Korean stroke patients.We analyzed the demographics, risk factors, in-hospital mortality, functional outcomes at discharge, and any-cause mortality over a 5-year period for 18,364 Korean patients, and determined a cumulative mortality rate using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to elucidate gender differences in stroke outcomes.Women suffered strokes that were severer than those suffered by men. Although women had a lower risk of any-cause death than men, they exhibited poorer functional status at discharge.In Korea, women lived longer, but had greater disabilities after strokes than men, indicating the need to develop gender-specific interventions to improve stroke outcomes and reduce the disability burden in women."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Little research has been conducted to examine the relationship between education level and functional limitations among Japanese community residents. We sought to examine the association between education level and physical functional limitations among Japanese men and women, and whether that association was modified by gender and history of stroke.We examined prevalence of physical functional limitation by educational level using the data from a total of 29,134 Japanese men and women aged 50-69 years living in communities in 2000. The information of educational level (junior high school graduates, senior high school graduates, college and/or higher education) and physical functional limitations (no need for assistance, need for assistance when going outdoors, and need for assistance to carry out indoor activities) were obtained by self-administrated questionnaire.The proportions of the subjects reported their highest level of schooling were 48% for junior high school, 39% for high school, and 13% for college. Three hundred and twenty eight subjects (1% of total subjects) reported having some physical functional limitations. Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that the odds ratio of needing assistance to carry out indoor activities were 4.84(95%CI:3.61,6.50) for lowest education level group and 2.21(95%CI:1.00,4.86) for middle education level group compared to highest education level group. The corresponding odds ratios of needing assistance when going outdoors were 2.36(95%CI: 2.03,2.72) and 1.08(95%CI:0.73,1.60), respectively. Further, the significant excess prevalence of having functional limitations associated with the low education level was identified for men regardless of history of stroke and for women without history of stroke.Low education level was associated with the higher prevalence of physical functional limitations for both genders. That association among persons with history of stroke was observed for men but not for women probably due to gender differences in stroke subtypes and social support."Stroke	Outcomes	"Differences between men and women in stroke symptoms, management and disability have been reported to be unfavorable for women. Yet, studies into differences between men and women in survival after a stroke yielded inconsistent results. We investigated whether gender was associated with all-cause mortality after hospital admission for stroke.A nationwide cohort of patients with a first admission for stroke and stroke subtypes was identified through linkage of national registers. Age- and gender-specific mortality risks were quantified for 28-day case-fatality, 1-year and 5-year periods. Cox regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding factors.We identified 30,675 stroke patients (15,925 women, 14,750 men). In ischemic-stroke patients, 28-day case-fatality, 1-year and 5-year mortality risk (hazard ratio (HR) 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.95, HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.92, HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.88, respectively) and in intracerebral-hemorrhage patients, 1-year and 5-year mortality risks (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99) were lower for women compared to men after adjustment for age and previous admissions for cardiovascular diseases or diabetes mellitus. In subarachnoid hemorrhage patients, no differences between men and women in crude and adjusted mortality risks were observed. When all stroke types were combined, differences in mortality risk between men and women were seen, and appeared to differ by age (increased risk in young women, lower risk in older women).Women have lower 28-day case-fatality and long-term mortality risks after an ischemic stroke and lower 1-year and 5-year mortality risks after an intracerebral hemorrhage compared to men, whereas no differences in mortality risks were found for subarachnoid hemorrhage."Stroke	Outcomes	"We describe self-reported consequences for physical and cognitive functions, detect possible gender differences, and find factors that were associated with deteriorated physical function in younger stroke patients, independent in their personal activities of daily life.This study involved all first ever stroke patients, aged 18-55 years, registered in the Swedish national quality register for stroke. A questionnaire was answered by 1068 patients 8-36 months after the stroke. Changes were sought in physical and cognitive functions as compared with the pre-stroke condition.Eight hundred and sixty-seven patients (83%) were independent in personal activities of daily life. Significant differences between men and women were found: deteriorated physical ability was reported by 56-71% of the men and 65-79% of the women; deteriorated cognitive function was reported by 48-57% of the men and 57-68% of the women. Many patients (70% men, 77% women) reported that they had received insufficient information about physical exertion. Significant associations were found between deteriorated physical function and deteriorated cognitive function as well as fear of physical exertion.Deterioration was found in physical and cognitive functions greater in women then in men. Insecurity regarding physical exertion existed indicating that younger stroke patients might need information directly aimed at physical functioning and more gender specific than today. This study has raised the awareness that there also might be gender differences in other fields, which needs further studies."Stroke	Outcomes	"The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality after acute stroke and investigate the impact of gender on stroke mortality. All patients admitted to Al-watani governmental hospital in Palestine from September 2006 to August 2007 and diagnosed with acute stroke were included in the study. Diagnosis of stroke was confirmed by computerized tomography scan. Demographics and clinical data pertaining to the patients were obtained from their medical files. The main outcome measure in this study was vital status at hospital discharge. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 15. A total of 186 acute stroke cases (95 females and 91 males) were included in the study. Hypertension (69.9%) and diabetes mellitus (45.2%) were the most common risk factors among the patients. Thirty nine (21%) of the stroke patients died in hospital. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that chronic kidney disease (P = 0.004), number of post-stroke complications (P = 0.037), and stroke subtype (P = 0.015) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality among the total stroke patients. Knowledge of in-hospital mortality predictors is required to improve survival rate after acute stroke. The study showed that gender was not an independent predictor of mortality after acute stroke. More research is required to understand gender differences in stroke mortality."Stroke	Management	"Large studies of patients with acute stroke not receiving thrombolytic therapy have repeatedly demonstrated poorer outcomes for women compared to men. An analysis of five pooled randomized controlled trials testing IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) demonstrated that rtPA benefits women more than men; the usual gender difference, apparent among controls, was totally nullified in the rtPA group. This nullification of the usual gender effect among rtPA-treated patients has not been confirmed.We analyzed baseline characteristics and functional outcomes in men vs women in the Canadian Alteplase for Stroke Effectiveness Study (CASES), a multicenter study that collected outcomes data for patients treated with rtPA in Canada to assess the safety and effectiveness of alteplase for stroke in the context of routine care.Among 1,110 patients, including 615 men and 505 women, a normal or near normal outcome at 90 days was found in 37.1% of men vs 36.0% of women (p = 0.71). This was essentially unchanged after adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, including age >70, glucose, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Severity, and baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (35.2% in men vs 38.2% in women, p = 0.332). Ninety-day mortality was similar between the sexes in both the adjusted and unadjusted analysis.There was no difference in 90-day outcomes in recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)-treated men and rtPA-treated women. This is consistent with the pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials, showing greater benefit for thrombolysis in women and nullification of the usual gender difference in outcome."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Sex differences in patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke have not been systematically analyzed. We aimed to determine sex influences on demographics, vascular risk factors, clinical manifestations, stroke location, and clinical outcome.One thousand two hundred eighty-eight consecutive patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) were admitted to a single stroke center. All patients underwent a complete stroke workup including clinical examination, standard blood tests, cerebral and vascular imaging, transesophageal echocardiography, and 24-hour electrocardiography. In 500 patients, no definite etiology could be established (cryptogenic stroke/TIA). Of them, 167 patients (107 men and 60 women, mean age 52 +/- 13 years) had an PFO.The prevalence of PFO in patients with cryptogenic stroke or TIA was higher in men than in women (38% vs 28%, P = .014). Stroke severity and the prevalence of risk factors did not differ between the 2 sexes. There was an independent association between male sex and stroke location in the posterior cerebral circulation (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4-6.5, P = .006). Men and women did not differ in respect to PFO grade, prevalence of right-to-left shunt at rest, or coexistence of atrial septal aneurysm. Clinical outcome at 3 months was similar in both sexes.Patent foramen ovale was more prevalent in men than in women with cryptogenic stroke. There were no sex influences on age, risk factors, echocardiographic characteristics of PFO, or clinical outcome. Male sex was independently associated with stroke in the posterior cerebral circulation."Stroke	Management	"We aimed to investigate age and gender differences in arterial stiffness, and whether this cardiovascular risk factor was detectable in healthy Caucasians before established disease was manifest.A growing number of risk factors including diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, smoking and age have been linked to the adverse cardiovascular end-points of myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure. These risk factors lead to an increase in arterial stiffness. Measuring this stiffness at an early age may identify candidates for primary preventative intervention strategies by nurses.Caucasian Canadians (n = 176) were recruited. Peripheral and central blood pressure, pulse pressure, augmentation pressure, arterial compliance (augmentation index and pulse wave velocity) and sub-endocardial viability ratio (SEVR), were assessed using applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor system). Blood was drawn for fasting lipid and glucose profiling.Women participants had significantly stiffer arteries than men (augmentation index: 28 SEM = 1% vs. 18 SEM = 2% respectively; p < 0.001). Pulse wave velocity, however, was not different (7.7 SEM = 0.2 m/s vs. 8.3 SEM = 0.1 m/s respectively; p < 0.001). Age was a strong predictor of arterial stiffening in both genders, but the effect was greater in women.Women having stiffer arteries than men, thus at greater cardiovascular risk, may require earlier screening. The effect might be postmenopausal, and mechanisms require further investigation. However, both middle-aged men and women considering themselves 'healthy' may benefit from more proactive primary prevention.Applanation tonometry, used extensively by nurses, provides early detection of central haemodynamic changes and vascular compliance at all ages. Knowledge of arterial stiffness could guide the management of primary prevention in the nursing cardiovascular risk reduction clinic."Stroke	Review	"Stroke has a greater effect on women than men because women have more events and are less likely to recover. Age-specific stroke rates are higher in men, but, because of their longer life expectancy and much higher incidence at older ages, women have more stroke events than men. With the exception of subarachnoid haemorrhage, there is little evidence of sex differences in stroke subtype or severity. Although several reports found that women are less likely to receive some in-hospital interventions, most differences disappear after age and comorbidities are accounted for. However, sex disparities persist in the use of thrombolytic treatment (with alteplase) and lipid testing. Functional outcomes and quality of life after stroke are consistently poorer in women, despite adjustment for baseline differences in age, prestroke function, and comorbidities. Here, we comprehensively review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, medical care, and outcomes of stroke in women."Stroke	Outcomes	"Hemispatial neglect is a common and disabling consequence of stroke. Previous reports examining the relationship between gender and the incidence of unilateral spatial neglect (USN) have included either a large numbers of patients with few neglect tests or small numbers of patients with multiple tests. To determine if USN was more common and/or severe in men or women, we examined a large group of patients (312 right-handed) within 24 hours of acute right hemisphere ischemic stroke. Multiple spatial neglect tasks were used to increase the sensitivity of neglect detection. No differences based upon gender were observed for the prevalence, severity, or a combined task measure of USN."Stroke	Review	"Stroke remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Sexual differences in stroke have been recognized, though the mechanisms remain unclear. Women have a unique risk factor profile, especially so in the reproductively active age group. Exposure to oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy and a higher incidence of migraine and vasculitic disorders in women suggest that stroke would be common in women. Yet, the incidence of stroke remains higher in men across all ages, indicating a protective role of sex hormones. The differences in incidence and prevalence of stroke decreases as women age, confirming that hormones play a pivotal role in terms of normal physiology, disease and recovery. Recent evidence also points to sex based differences in response to therapy, in terms of acute management and prevention. Gender based differences in accessibility and provision of health care facilities add to the observed differences in terms of stroke outcome, though here women seem to fare worse than men. This review summarizes the observed sex differences in stroke, possible hormonal mechanisms that may explain the same and outlines recent patents and scope for future research in this field."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"We sought to develop a model system for live analysis of brain inflammatory response in ischemic injury.Using a reporter mouse-expressing luciferase gene under transcriptional control of the murine glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter (GFAP-luc mice) and biophotonic/bioluminescent imaging as tools, we developed a model system for in vivo analysis of astrocyte activation/response in cerebral ischemia.Analysis of photon emissions from the brains of living animals revealed marked sex differences in astrocyte response to ischemic injury. The increase in GFAP signals was significantly higher in female mice in the metestrus/diestrus period compared with male transgenic mice (1.71 x 10(7)+/-0.19 x 10(7) vs 0.92 x 10(7)+/-0.15 x 10(7), P<0.001). Similar results were obtained by quantitative immunohistochemistry (males vs females: 13.4+/-0.5 vs 16.96+/-0.64, P<0.0001). However, astrocyte activation/GFAP signals showed cyclic, estrus-dependent variations in response to ischemic injury. Physiologically higher levels of estrogen and application of pharmacologic doses of estrogen during replacement therapy attenuated GFAP upregulation after stroke. Interestingly, contrary to a positive correlation between the intensities of GFAP signals and infarct size in male mice, no such correlation was observed in any of the experimental groups of female GFAP-luc mice.Our results suggest that GFAP upregulation in ischemic injury may have different functional significance in female and male experimental animals and may not directly reflect the extent of ischemia-induced neuronal damage in female GFAP-luc mice. Using a novel live imaging approach, we demonstrated that the early-phase brain inflammatory response to ischemia may be associated with sex-specific biomarkers of brain damage."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and endothelial dysfunction are key contributors to cerebrovascular pathophysiology. We previously found that 17beta-estradiol profoundly affects mitochondrial function in cerebral blood vessels, enhancing efficiency of energy production and suppressing mitochondrial oxidative stress. To determine whether estrogen specifically affects endothelial mitochondria through receptor mechanisms, we used cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). 17beta-Estradiol treatment for 24 h increased mitochondrial cytochrome c protein and mRNA; use of silencing RNA for estrogen receptors (ERs) showed that this effect involved ERalpha, but not ERbeta. Mitochondrial ROS were determined by measuring the activity of aconitase, an enzyme with an iron-sulfur center inactivated by mitochondrial superoxide. 17beta-Estradiol increased mitochondrial aconitase activity in HBMECs, indicating a reduction in ROS. Direct measurement of mitochondrial superoxide with MitoSOX Red showed that 17beta-estradiol, but not 17alpha-estradiol, significantly decreased mitochondrial superoxide production, an effect blocked by the ER antagonist, ICI-182,780 (fulvestrant). Selective ER agonists demonstrated that the decrease in mitochondrial superoxide was mediated by ERalpha, not ERbeta. The selective estrogen receptor modulators, raloxifene and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, differentially affected mitochondrial superoxide production, with raloxifene acting as an agonist but 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen acting as an estrogen antagonist. Changes in superoxide by 17beta-estradiol could not be explained by changes in manganese superoxide dismutase. Instead, ERalpha-mediated decreases in mitochondrial ROS may depend on the concomitant increase in mitochondrial cytochrome c, previously shown to act as an antioxidant. Mitochondrial protective effects of estrogen in cerebral endothelium may contribute to sex differences in the occurrence of stroke and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases."Stroke	Review	"Anesthesiologists are frequently confronted with patients who are at risk for neurological complications due to perioperative stroke or prior traumatic brain injury. In this review, we address the growing and fascinating body of data that suggests gender and sex steroids influence the pathophysiology of injury and outcome for these patients. Cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and epilepsy are reviewed in the context of potential sex differences in mechanisms and outcomes of brain injury and the role of estrogen, progesterone, and androgens in shaping these processes. Lastly, implications for current and future perioperative and intensive care are identified."Stroke	Review	"Atherothrombosis is associated with significant mortality and morbidity in both men and women. Management of this disease, however, is generally guided by evidence from trials conducted predominantly in men, with few studies focused on women alone. Our objective was to review the characteristics and management of atherothrombotic disease in women, with particular emphasis on the therapeutic role of antiplatelet agents.Landmark clinical trials and other studies pertaining to atherothrombosis in women (including risk factors, clinical outcomes, and treatment patterns) were obtained through Pubmed and Medline literature research and reviewed.Primary prevention studies indicate a clear benefit of antiplatelet therapy in the reduction of cardiovascular events and, in particular, the risk of stroke in women >or=65 years. In men, this benefit is attributable to a reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Combination therapies, including aspirin plus dipyridamole or clopidogrel, effectively reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events in women. However, the effects are not consistent between men and women across studies. Similarly, gender differences exist in the effect of intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors plus aspirin on the risk of death or cardiovascular events.The effects of antiplatelet therapy regimens differ between men and women. The mechanisms underlying these differences are still to be elucidated; this report highlights the need for more studies focused on women in order to optimize gender-specific therapy and, therefore, improve clinical outcomes in women with atherothrombosis."Stroke	Outcomes	"Many studies have reported poorer stroke outcomes in women, and some studies have reported sex differences in care. We analyzed data from a hospital-based stroke registry to determine whether acute stroke care and discharge status differed by sex.Detailed chart-level information was collected on 2566 subjects admitted for acute stroke or transient ischemic attack to 15 Michigan hospitals in 2002. Sex differences in stroke care and patient status at discharge (in-hospital mortality and modified Rankin Scale score) were assessed after adjusting for differences in demographics, clinical characteristics, and comorbidities by multivariable models. Modified Rankin Scale score data were analyzed by proportional-odds models.Women were older than men (70 vs 67 years) and were more likely to have congestive heart failure and hypertension. Men were more likely to smoke and have a history of heart disease and dyslipidemia. After multivariable adjustment, women were less likely to receive thrombolytic therapy (odds ratio [OR]=0.56; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.86) or lipid testing (OR=0.76; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.94) and were more likely to suffer urinary tract infections (OR=2.57; 95% CI, 1.87 to 3.54). In-hospital mortality was similar in women and men (9% vs 8%); however, women had poorer discharge modified Rankin Scale scores (OR=1.17; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.35).Although considerable parity exists in many aspects of acute stroke care, women were less likely than men to receive thrombolytic treatment and lipid testing, even after adjustment. However, given the largely similar care observed, it is unlikely that differences in care explain the poorer functional outcomes in female stroke survivors."Stroke	Review	"Using data from Oxfordshire, UK, we recently showed that women are more likely than men to have a family history of stroke in female versus male first degree relatives. To test the generalizability of this finding, we did a comprehensive systematic review of all available published and unpublished data.Studies were included in the present review if they reported the frequency of family history of stroke in relation to sex of parent or proband. Where necessary, we contacted authors of studies to obtain unpublished data. Data from the Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC) and 3 other Oxford cohorts (1925 patients) were secondarily pooled with the data from other studies.We obtained data from 18 studies (7941 patients), including unpublished data from 7 studies. Female probands were slightly more likely to have a parental history of stroke than male probands (pooled OR=1.15; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.29; P((sig))=0.028; P((het))=0.45). Maternal history of stroke was more common than paternal history (pooled OR=1.25; 1.15 to 1.37; P((sig))<0.00001; P((het))=0.12). However, the maternal excess was only present in female probands (pooled OR=1.47; 1.27 to 1.70; P((sig))<0.00001; P((het))=0.11). In contrast, male probands were no more likely to have maternal than paternal history of stroke (pooled OR=1.02; 0.88 to 1.17, P((sig))=0.43; P((het))=0.09).Women with stroke are more likely than men to have a parental history of stroke, which is accounted for by an excess maternal history of stroke. This finding could be explained by sex-specific genetic, epigenetic, or nongenetic mechanisms."Stroke	Review	"Stroke is a major public health problem. The female population carries a higher stroke burden than the male population, both because females have a longer life expectancy and because most stroke deaths occur in women. Differences between the sexes in relation to stroke are increasingly being recognized; for example, among stroke survivors, women tend to have worse outcomes than men, as indicated by more-severe disability and an increased likelihood of institutionalization in women. Women and men with stroke also differ in their risk factor profiles, and they respond differently to primary-prevention and acute stroke treatment. Women experience variations in endogenous estrogens throughout their life cycle and might also be exposed to exogenous estrogens, both of which markedly affect the brain. An understanding of the effects of endogenous and exogenous estrogens on cerebral hemodynamics could guide research into explaining how hormone therapy increases the risk of stroke in postmenopausal women. This Review summarizes the sex differences related to stroke, and the effect of endogenous and exogenous hormones on the cerebrovasculature of the female brain. It also proposes potential research approaches, the results of which could fill in gaps in our knowledge regarding the mechanism of action of estrogen in the brain."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Gender differences in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among the Sami have been reported previously. The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of and mortality from stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the Swedish Sami population between 1985 and 2002, and to analyse the potential impact of income and level of education on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.A Sami cohort of 15,914 persons (4,465 reindeer herding and 11,449 non-herding Sami) were followed up from 1985 to 2002 with regard to incidence and mortality rates of AMI, stroke, and SAH. Incidence and mortality ratios were calculated using a demographically matched non-Sami control population (DMC) as the standard (71,550 persons).There was no elevated risk of developing AMI among the Sami compared with the DMC. However, the mortality ratio of AMI was significantly higher for Sami women. Higher incidence rates of stroke and SAH for both Sami men and women was observed, but no differences in mortality rates. Apart from the reindeer-herding men who demonstrated lower levels of income and education, the income and education levels among Sami were similar to the DMC.High mortality rates from AMI rather than stroke explain the excess mortality for CVD previously shown among Sami women. The results suggest that the differences in incidence of stroke between herding and non-herding Sami men, and between Sami women and non-Sami women, are caused by behavioural and psychosocial risk factors rather than by traditional socioeconomic ones."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Women are less susceptible to the cerebrovascular complications of hypertension, such as a stroke and vascular dementia. The mechanism of such protection may be related to a reduced vulnerability of women to the cerebrovascular actions of hypertension. To test this hypothesis, we used a model of hypertension based on infusion of angiotensin II (ANG II), an octapeptide that plays a key role in hypertension and produces cerebrovascular dysregulation. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized (urethane-chloralose) C57BL/6J male and female mice equipped with a cranial window. ANG II administration (0.25 mug.kg(-1).min(-1) iv x 30-45 min) elevated arterial pressure equally in both sexes but attenuated the CBF increase induced by whisker stimulation or by the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh) in male but not in female mice. The administration of ANG II for 7 days (2.74 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), using osmotic minipumps, also attenuated these cerebrovascular responses in male, but not female, mice. The reduced susceptibility to the effect of ANG II in female mice was abolished by ovariectomy and reinstated by estrogen administration to ovariectomized mice. Administration of estrogen to male mice abolished the ANG II-induced attenuation of CBF responses. We conclude that female mice are less susceptible to the cerebrovascular dysregulation induced by ANG II, an effect related to estrogen. Such protection from the deleterious cerebrovascular effects of hypertension may play a role in the reduced vulnerability to the cerebrovascular complications of hypertension observed in women."Stroke	Epidemiology	"This study estimated the risk of incident stroke according to the level of job control and examined whether the association between job control and the risk of stroke varied as a function of gender.This was a register-based cohort study of nearly 3 million working people (age 30-64 years in 1990) with a 13-year follow-up (1991-2003) for incident stroke (50 114 events). Job control was aggregated to the data by a secondary data source (job-exposure matrix) in 1990. Gender-specific Cox regressions were applied.The age- and workhour-adjusted hazard ratio of the lowest versus the highest job control quartile was 1.25 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.17-1.32] for any stroke, 1.33 (95% CI 1.15-1.55) for intracerebral hemorrhage, and 1.22 (95% CI 1.14-1.31) for brain infarction among the women, and the corresponding figures for the men were 1.24 (95% CI 1.21-1.28), 1.30 (95% CI 1.21-1.40), 1.23 (95% CI 1.19-1.28), respectively. Adjustment for education, marital status, and income attenuated these associations to 1.07 (95% CI 1.01-1.14) for any stroke, 1.22 (95% CI 1.04-1.42) for intracerebral hemorrhage, and 1.04 (95% CI 0.97-1.12) for brain infarction for the women and to 1.08 (95% CI 1.04-1.12), 1.12 (95% CI 1.03-1.22), 1.08 (95% CI 1.04-1.13), respectively, for the men.The relative risk of stroke was higher in low job-control occupations. The association between job control and stroke subtypes varied as a function of gender. The relative risk of intracerebral hemorrhage was highest for the women in low job-control occupations."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) has been shown to be important in the evolution of stroke-associated cerebral edema. However, the role of AQP4 in stroke-associated cerebral edema as it pertains to sex has not been previously studied. The perivascular pool of AQP4 is important in the influx and efflux of water during focal cerebral ischemia. We used mice with targeted disruption of the gene encoding alpha-syntrophin (alpha-Syn(-/-)) that lack the perivascular AQP4 pool but retain the endothelial pool of this protein. Infarct volume at 72 h after transient focal ischemia (90 mins) in isoflurane-anesthetized mice was attenuated in both sexes with alpha-Syn deletion as compared with their wild-type (WT) counterparts. There were no sex differences in hemispheric water content in WT and alpha-Syn(-/-) mice or regional AQP4 expression in WT mice. In neither sex did alpha-Syn deletion lead to alterations in end-ischemic regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). These data suggest that after experimental stroke: (1) there is no difference in stroke-associated cerebral edema based on sex, (2) AQP4 does not involve in sex-based differences in stroke volume, and (3) perivascular pool of AQP4 has no significant role in end-ischemic rCBF."Stroke	Outcomes	"The prevalence of stroke in elderly patients has been increasing in recent years. However, limited information is available about the burden of stroke in individuals over 80. We sought to evaluate differences in clinical outcomes in Canadians over 80 years old hospitalized for an acute ischemic stroke.The authors conducted a multicenter cohort study including all hospital admissions for ischemic stroke identified from the Canadian Hospital Morbidity and Mortality Database from April 2003 to March 2004. The Hospital Morbidity and Mortality Database contains a national database that contains patient-level sociodemographic, diagnostic, procedural, and administrative information from across Canada. Multivariable analysis was performed using logistic regression. The primary outcome was 7-day case fatality and fatality at discharge. Secondary end points included intensive care unit admissions, medical complications, gender differences, length of hospital stay, and discharge disposition.We analyzed 26,676 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 606 hospitals across Canada. Mean age (SD) was 74+/-13 years. Overall, 10,171 (38%) were aged 80 years or older. Case fatality at discharge was 5.7% (age < 59), 8.6% (age 60 to 69), 13.4% (age 70 to 79), and 24.2% (age > or = 80; P<0.001). Patients aged 80 and over were less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (7.7% versus 15.3%; P<0.001) and discharged to their prestroke residence (47.2% for those over 80 versus 61.6% for patients younger than 80; P<0.001). Median length of stay was longer in those over 80 (10 days versus 7 days; P<0.0001). In the multivariable analysis for the older group, admission to the intensive care unit, low socioeconomic status, and admission to a nonacademic institution were associated with increased fatality after adjusting for covariates.Aging of the population is a growing reality in Western societies and this translates into an increasing demand on healthcare systems. In our study, patients with stroke over 80 had higher risk-adjusted fatality, longer hospitalization, and were less likely to be discharged to their original place of residence. Strategies need to be implemented to facilitate equal access to specialized stroke care for the elderly."Stroke	Outcomes	"Studies suggest that women with stroke are investigated less aggressively and receive tissue plasminogen activator less frequently than men. We tested whether gender differences in the investigation, treatment, and outcome of stroke are due to confounding factors.Gender differences in the use of investigations, trial enrollment, treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, and in-hospital outcomes were examined in data from our prospective registry using multivariate analysis to adjust for age, prestroke functional status, stroke subtype and severity, and atrial fibrillation.Of 2725 consecutive hospitalized patients (1996 to 2006), 88% had ischemic stroke and 48% were women. Women were older (median age, 77 versus 70 years), had more severe strokes, and were less likely to be independent prestroke (78% versus 87%) compared with men (all P<0.001). The proportion of women, but not men, aged >or=80 years, increased significantly between 1996 to 1997 and 2005 to 2006. After adjustment for confounding, women were less likely to have infratentorial strokes (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97), be able to walk unaided on admission (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.87), be treated with tissue plasminogen activator (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.72), experience pneumonia (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.55), achieve a discharge Barthel Index of >or=95 (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.94, and were more likely to experience a urinary tract infection (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.61 to 2.64). There was no gender difference in adjusted use of investigations.The majority of the gender differences in stroke were explained by confounding. More research is required to understand gender differences in stroke pathophysiology and the utilization of thrombolytic therapy."Stroke	Outcomes	"The main purpose of this study was to test whether the impact of job control on stroke mortality is independent of socioeconomic factors.This was a register-based cohort study of nearly 3.5 million working people (25 to 64 years of age in the 1990 Swedish Census) with a 5-year follow-up for stroke mortality. Job control was aggregated to the data from a secondary data source (job exposure matrix). Gender-specific Poisson regressions were performed.Compared with high job control occupations, low job control was significantly related to hemorrhagic (relative risk, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.17) and all-stroke mortality (relative risk, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.03) in women but not in men. The significance of job control in women was independent of all confounders included (marital status, education level, and occupational class). Class-specific analyses indicated a consistent effect of job control for most classes (significant for female lower nonmanuals). However, low job control did not increase the risk of stroke mortality in upper nonmanuals.Job control was significantly related to hemorrhagic and all-stroke mortality in women but not in men."Stroke	Review	"Increasing evidence suggests that sex differences exist in the etiology, presentation, treatment, and outcome from stroke. The reasons for these sex disparities are becoming increasingly explored, but large gaps still exist in our knowledge. Experimental studies over the past several years have demonstrated intrinsic sex differences both in vivo and in animal models which may have relevance to our understanding of stroke in clinical populations. A greater understanding of the differences and similarities between males and females with respect to the risk factors, pathophysiology, and response to stroke will facilitate the design of future clinical trials and enhance the development of treatment strategies to improve stroke care in both sexes. This article reviews the current literature on sex differences in stroke with an emphasis on the clinical data, incorporating an analysis of bench research as it pertains to the bedside."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Adenosine deaminase (ADA) catalyzes the irreversible hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine. The purpose of this study was to determine the plasma activities of total adenosine deaminase (ADA T), and its isoenzymes, ADA1 and ADA2, and ADA1/ADA2 ratio of male and female ischemic stroke patients.We determined activities of plasma ADA T, ADA1, ADA2 and ADA1/ADA2 ratio in 30 patients (15 men and 15 women) with acute ischemic stroke within 12 h of the onset of the attack, as well as in 30 control subjects (15 men and 15 women) of comparable age.There were significant differences between the ADA1 activity and ADA1/ADA2 ratio in male and female stroke patients (p<0.05). Compared with male stroke subjects, females had higher ADA1 activity and ADA1/ADA2 ratios. There were no significant differences between activities of ADA T and ADA2 in men and women of the stroke and control groups. In addition, the Canadian Neurological Scale in men was significantly higher than that of women in the stroke group (p<0.05).Our results suggest that the primary mechanism in men with ischemic stroke might involve the reduction of ADA1 activity. The reduction is probably an adaptation mechanism for induced increase in adenosine availability and protection of brain to ischemic injury."Stroke	Review	"We have known for some time that the epidemiology of human stroke is sexually dimorphic until late in life, well beyond the years of reproductive senescence and menopause. Now, a new concept is emerging: the mechanisms and outcome of cerebral ischemic injury are influenced strongly by biological sex as well as the availability of sex steroids to the brain. The principal mammalian estrogen (17 beta estradiol or E2) is neuroprotective in many types of brain injury and has been the major focus of investigation over the past several decades. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that although hormones are a major contributor to sex-specific outcomes, they do not fully account for sex-specific responses to cerebral ischemia. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent studies in cell culture and animal models that suggest that genetic sex determines experimental stroke outcome and that divergent cell death pathways are activated after an ischemic insult. These sex differences need to be identified if we are to develop efficacious neuroprotective agents for use in stroke patients."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"We aimed to study whether variations in vasoregulatory endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS 4a/b) and tissue-injury-associated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS R5/4) genes and smoking might explain gender differences in long-term survival after stroke.A total of 486 consecutive acute stroke patients, subjected to MRI, were followed up for a mean of 7.6 years. The eNOS 4a/b (n = 300) and iNOS R5/4 (n = 310) genotypes were determined by PCR. Of these patients, 213/300 (71.0%; eNOS 4a/b) and 223/310 (71.9%; iNOS R5/4) had died.Despite the fact that women were older than men (72.3 vs. 69.5 years, p = 0.001) at recruitment, poor long-term survival was not sex-related, but instead predicted by age (p < 0.0001), cardiac failure (p = 0.004), smoking (p = 0.017), diabetes (p = 0.049), and variation in the eNOS gene locus (p = 0.033). Smoking and variations in both eNOS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.53, p = 0.011] and iNOS loci (HR = 1.52, p = 0.073) were found to impact upon poor survival. We found a strong interaction between smoking, female sex, and the iNOS R5/4 genotype with the risk of death (HR = 3.23, CI = 1.51-6.90, p = 0.002). Compared with nonsmoking noncarriers, postmenopausal women who had been smokers and carried either the rare iNOS R5 allele (17.1%; HR = 4.23, CI = 1.84-9.75, p = 0.001) or the common eNOS 4b allele (71%; HR = 3.14, CI = 1.49-6.62, p = 0.003) were at a higher risk of death during the follow-up. These interactions were independent of each other, and were not found among men.The interaction between smoking and genetic variants of eNOS and iNOS predicts survival after stroke, especially among postmenopausal women."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Previous reports concerning sex-related differences in stroke management and outcome are inconsistent and are sometimes difficult to interpret. We used data from a national stroke register to further explore possible differences between men and women in baseline characteristics, stroke treatment, and outcome.This study included 24633 stroke events registered in Riks-Stroke, the Swedish national quality register for stroke care, during 2006. Information on background variables and treatment was collected during the hospital stay. After 3 months, the patients' living situation and outcome were assessed.Women were older than men when they had their stroke (mean age, 78.4 versus 73.6 years; P<0.001). On admission to the hospital, women were more often unconscious. Among conscious patients, there was no sex-related difference in the use of stroke unit care. Men and women had equal probability to receive thrombolysis and oral anticoagulants. Women were more likely to develop deep venous thromboses and fractures, whereas men were more likely to develop pneumonia during their hospital stay. Women had a lower 3-month survival, a difference that was associated with higher age and impaired level of consciousness on admission. Women were less often living at home at the 3-month follow-up. However, the difference in residency was not present in patients <85 years who were living at home without community support before the stroke.Reported sex differences in stroke care and outcome were mainly explained by the women's higher age and lower level of consciousness on admission."Stroke	Management	Epidemiologic studies suggest sex differences in evaluation of patients presenting with ischemic stroke. Sex differences in stroke evaluation could lead to sex differences in the validity of diagnosing ischemic stroke subtypes. This study assessed sex differences in the Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study (ISGS).The ISGS is a prospective case-control genetic association study of patients with first-ever ischemic stroke at 5 US tertiary stroke centers. The diagnostic tests performed as part of medical care were recorded for each enrolled patient.A total of 505 patients were enrolled; 45% (229 of 505) were women and 55% (276 of 505) were men. Mean age at time of stroke was greater for women (66.6 v 61.9 years; P = .001). Frequency of brain computed tomography was 92% (254 of 276) for men and 90% (206 of 229) for women (P = .42). Magnetic resonance imaging was completed in 84% (232 of 276) of men and 83% (191 of 229) of women (P = .91). Frequency of electrocardiography was 91% (252 of 276) for men and 90% (206 of 229) for women (P = .60). Echocardiography was done in 74% (203 of 276) of men and 79% (180 of 229) of women (P = .19). Cervical arterial imaging occurred in 91% (208 of 229) of women and 86% (237 of 276) of men (P = .09). Intracranial vascular imaging was performed in 75% (207 of 276) of men and 79% (181 of 229) of women (P = .28).Our findings suggest no significant sex differences in the extent to which major diagnostic tests were performed in patients in ISGS. Dedicated tertiary stroke centers may reduce the sex bias in stroke evaluation that has been identified by previous studies.Stroke	Outcomes	"Little is known about sex differences in stroke recovery. The few available studies have found that female stroke survivors are less likely to achieve independence in activities of daily living and have poorer quality of life than male survivors.A total of 373 acute stroke survivors discharged from 9 hospitals participating in a statewide stroke registry were prospectively enrolled in an outcomes study. Follow-up data, including the Barthel Index and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life, were obtained from the survivor or a proxy by telephone interview 90 days postdischarge. The independent effects of sex on activities of daily living independence (Barthel Index > or =95) and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life scores, controlling for age, race, subtype, prestroke ambulatory status, and other patient characteristics, were determined using adjusted odds ratios and least-squares means, respectively.Twenty-five percent of the patients required a proxy respondent. In adjusted models, females were less likely to achieve activities of daily living independence (adjusted OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.87). Females had lower least-squares means Stroke-Specific Quality of Life scores in Physical Function (3.9 versus 4.2, P=0.02), Thinking (2.8 versus 3.4, P<0.001), Language (4.3 versus 4.5, P=0.03), and Energy (2.6 versus 3.0, P<0.01). Interactions between sex and prior stroke were found for Mood, Role Function, and Summary Score, resulting in lower least-squares means for females only among subjects without prior stroke.Compared with males, female stroke survivors had lower functional recovery and poorer quality of life 3 months postdischarge. These differences were not explained by females' greater age at stroke onset or other demographic or clinical characteristics."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Though large epidemiological studies have not established associations between blood lipids and ischemic stroke, increasing evidences have suggested that lipid-modifying agents may reduce cerebrovascular events.To determine whether blood lipids are risk factors for ischemic stroke among hypertensive rural adults in China.A cross-sectional survey was conducted during 2004-2006, which underwent cluster multistage sampling to a hypertensive resident group in the countryside of China.A total of 6,412 individuals (2,805 men, 3,607 women) with age>or=35 years were included. At baseline, lifestyle and other factors were obtained and blood lipids were assessed at a central study laboratory. Ischemic stroke was defined according to the criteria established by the National Survey of Stroke and all cases were further classified into lacunar infarction and other ischemic strokes.Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used.In the univariable logistic regression model, LDL cholesterol (LDLc) in men and total cholesterol (TC), LDLc and TC-to-HDL cholesterol (TC: HDLc ratio) in women were risk factors for other ischemic strokes, with OR 1.42 (95% CI, 1.16-1.75), 1.31 (95% CI, 1.11-1.55), 1.47 (95% CI, 1.16-1.88) and 1.67 (95% CI, 1.28-2.14), respectively. After adjusting for independent variables, an increase in non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDLc) was associated with a significant increased risk of other ischemic strokes in women, with adjusted OR 1.45 (95% CI, 1.08-1.93).LDLc was the common risk factor for ischemic stroke in men and women, whereas Non-HDLc, TC and TC: HDLc ratio levels were related to ischemic stroke as risk factors only in women."Stroke	Review	"The incidence of stroke increases substantially after menopause, and in the United States it is the third leading cause of death. Data exist suggesting that women have worse outcomes for stroke than do men. Trials of aspirin use further suggest that there is a gender difference regarding stroke. While men may have a coronary benefit from aspirin, postmenopausal women do not; yet ischemic stroke may be decreased in women but not in men. Among the traditional risk factors for stroke (such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity), hormonal therapy (HT) has been suggested to be a risk as well, although the data are not consistent. The previous Position Statement of the IMS published in 2004 was relatively silent on the issue of stroke. The annual rate of stroke in women increases rapidly with aging in postmenopausal women. While the rate is approximately 0.6-0.8/1000/year at age 50-59, it is over 2/1000 after age 60. In white women in the USA, it is 4.2/1000 at 65-74 years of age, and 11.3/1000 between ages 75 and 84 years. Thus, in trials such as the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), most of the strokes occurred in older women. Both the conjugated equine estrogen/medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE/MPA) and CEE-alone trials in the WHI reported an increased risk of stroke in the entire population using nominal statistics: 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.85) and 1.39 (95% CI 1.10-1.77), respectively. The increased risk was related to ischemic stroke and not hemorrhagic stroke. The absolute risk for the entire population was 0.8/1000 and 1.2/1000 woman-years (<1/1000 signifies a 'rare' event using the CIOMS classification). However, the risk was not increased in the 50-59-year-old age group, although the numbers are small. Here, the background prevalence of stroke is much lower as noted above. The results of the observational trial of the WHI were not consistent with the randomized clinical trial data and were more in keeping with older observational data showing no increased risk of stroke. The authors reconcile these differences by suggesting differences in the timing of initiation of hormones, which was at an earlier age in the observational cohort. Several recent observational studies, which will be presented, show no increased risk of ischemic stroke in younger cohorts, but possibly an increase in the risk of transient ischemic attack. These recent studies suggested the risk to be less with lower doses of estradiol < or =1 mg and to be consistent with older studies showing no risk with doses < 0.625 mg CEE. In addition, the risk was possibly lower with non-oral therapy, and was reduced if started prior to menopause. The existence of hypertension was shown to substantially increase the risk. However, data on progestogen use versus unopposed estrogen have not been consistent. At the same time, a recent body of evidence from basic science studies has reaffirmed the neuronal and stroke protective effects of estrogen. Thus, the discrepancy between these data and clinical data showing no benefit or increased risk of stroke remains to be explained. Recent trials in older women with osteoporosis have suggested an increased risk of stroke with tibolone and of stroke mortality with raloxifene. In conclusion, the current data suggest no increased risk of stroke with hormone therapy in younger (50-59 years) normotensive postmenopausal women, particularly when lower doses are prescribed soon after menopause."Stroke	Review	"1. It is well documented that the incidence and severity of several vascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis and stroke, are lower in premenopausal women than men of similar age and post-menopausal women. The mechanisms responsible for gender differences in the incidence and severity of vascular disease are not well understood. However, emerging evidence suggests that sex hormone-dependent differences in vascular oxidative stress may play an important role. The aim of the present brief review is to provide an insight into the effect of gender and sex hormones on vascular oxidative stress. 2. When production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is enhanced and/or their metabolism by anti-oxidant enzymes is impaired, a condition known as 'oxidative stress' can develop. Oxidative stress is believed to play an important role in both the initiation and progression of a variety of vascular diseases, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. NADPH oxidases are believed to be the major source of vascular ROS. Moreover, excessive production of ROS by NADPH oxidases has been linked to the development of vascular oxidative stress. 3. Increasing evidence suggests that levels of vascular ROS may be lower in women than men during health and disease. Indeed, the activity and expression of vascular NADPH oxidase is lower in female versus male animals under healthy, hypertensive and atherosclerotic conditions. 4. Gonadal sex hormones may play an important role in the regulation of vascular oxidative stress. For example, oestrogens, which are present in highest levels in premenopausal women, have been reported to lower vascular oxidative stress by modulating the expression and function of NADPH oxidases, as well as anti-oxidant enzymes. 5. Further studies are needed to clarify whether lower vascular oxidative stress in women in fact protects against the initiation and development of vascular disease and to further define the roles of gonadal sex hormones in such an effect. Knowledge gained from these studies may potentially lead to advances in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease in both genders."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Data from the Framingham Heart Study suggest that women may be more sensitive to the deleterious cardiovascular remodeling effects of aldosterone. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that chronic treatment with spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, decreases ischemic cerebral infarct size and prevents remodeling of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in male spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP). Therefore, we hypothesized that MR antagonism would reduce ischemic infarct size and prevent MCA remodeling in female SHRSP. Six-week-old female SHRSP were treated for 6 wk with spironolactone (25 or 50 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) or eplerenone (100 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) and compared with untreated controls. At 12 wk, cerebral ischemia was induced for 18 h using the intraluminal suture occlusion technique, or the MCA was isolated for analysis of passive structure using a pressurized arteriograph. MR antagonism had no effect on infarct size or passive MCA structure in female SHRSP. To study the potential effects of estrogen, the above experiments were repeated in bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) female SHRSP treated with spironolactone (25 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)). Infarct size and vessel structure in OVX SHRSP were not different from control SHRSP. Spironolactone had no effect on infarct size in OVX SHRSP. However, MCA lumen and outer diameters were increased in spironolactone-treated OVX SHRSP, suggesting an effect of estrogen. Cerebral artery MR expression, assessed by Western blotting, was increased in female, compared with male, SHRSP. These studies highlight an apparent sexual dimorphism of MR expression and activity in the cerebral vasculature from hypertensive rats."Stroke	Epidemiology	"We assessed sex differences in stroke prevalence among individuals of midlife age (35 to 64 years) in the United States and determined factors predicting stroke.Data from 1999 to 2004 (n = 17,061) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative sample of US adults, were used to assess sex differences in stroke prevalence and to identify independent predictors of stroke occurrence among middle-aged individuals.Women aged 45 to 54 years had significantly higher odds of having experienced a stroke vs men of the same age (odds ratio [OR] 2.39, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.32). No other significant midlife stroke differences between sexes were noted. A higher stroke trend was seen in 45- to 54-year-old women vs 35- to 44-year-old women (OR 2.13, 95% CI 0.95 to 4.80, p = 0.067), but no difference was seen in stroke rates in 55- to 64-year-old women vs 45- to 54-year-old women (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.6912 to 2.8229, p = 0.352). Independent predictors of stroke in women aged 45 to 54 years were coronary artery disease (OR 12.790, 95% CI 1.901 to 86.063, p = 0.009) and waist circumference (OR 1.543, 95% CI 1.002 to 2.376, p = 0.049). Several vascular risk factors including systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol levels increased at higher rates among women compared with men in each successively older cohort from 35 to 64 years.A higher prevalence of stroke may exist among women aged 45 to 54 years compared with similarly aged men. This potential disparity could be due in part to inadequate stroke risk factor modification in women and is deserving of further study."Stroke	Outcomes	"Female sex is predictive of poor functional outcome in stroke, even after correction for prognostic factors. Poor quality of life (QoL) is observed in stroke survivors with lower scores seen in the most disabled patients. We used data from the Tinzaparin in Acute Ischaemic Stroke Trial (TAIST) to assess the relationship between sex and QoL after ischemic stroke.TAIST was a randomized, controlled trial assessing the safety and efficacy of tinzaparin versus aspirin in 1484 patients with acute ischemic stroke. QoL was measured at 180 days postrandomization using the Short Form-36 health survey, which assesses QoL across 8 domains. The relationship between sex and each domain was assessed using ordinal regression, both unadjusted and adjusted for key prognostic factors.Of the 1484 patients randomized into TAIST, 216 had died at 180 days postrandomization. A total of 1268 survivors were included in this analysis, 694 males (55%) and 574 females (45%). Females tended to score lower than males across all QoL domains (apart from general health); statistically significant lower scores were seen for physical functioning (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.72), vitality (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.98), and mental health (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.93). The results for physical functioning and mental health remained significant after adjustment for prognostic variables (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.92; OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.95, respectively).QoL, in particular physical function and mental health domains, is lower in female patients after stroke. This difference persists even after correction for known prognostic factors such as age and stroke severity."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Laboratory-based studies have suggested that individual differences in cardiovascular reactivity and stress adaptive capacity are associated with stroke incidence. We test the hypothesis that sense of coherence (SOC), a marker of social stress adaptive capacity, is associated with incident stroke in a population-based prospective cohort study.A total of 20,629 participants, aged 41 to 80 years, in the UK European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk study, who had not previously experienced a stroke, completed assessments that included SOC and details of their experience of life events during adulthood. An index of adaptation was constructed from responses to questions concerning over 80,000 adverse life events.During 145,000 person-years of follow-up (mean 7.1 years), 452 participants experienced either a fatal or nonfatal stroke event. A strong (as opposed to a weak) SOC was associated with a reduced rate of stroke incidence (rate ratio 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.96) after adjustment for age, sex, pre-existing myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypertension treatment, family history of stroke, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, obesity, social class, education, hostility and depression. No sex difference in this association was observed. Measures of social adversity occurrence and impact were not associated with stroke incidence, whereas faster reported adaptation to adverse event exposure was associated with a reduced rate of stroke incidence (rate ratio 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.98; per standard deviation change in adaptation score, adjusted for age and sex).Stress adaptive capacity is a potentially important candidate risk factor for stroke."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Previous studies have shown that women are at higher risk than men for stroke after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, but gender differences in systemic atherosclerosis have not been studied adequately. We investigated gender differences in the incidence of craniocervical and ascending aortic atherosclerosis and other risk factors for stroke in elderly patients (age > or =60 yr) undergoing CABG surgery.Data were prospectively collected on 720 patients (31.8% women) undergoing CABG surgery. All patients underwent preoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging and angiography to assess for prior cerebral infarctions, carotid artery stenosis, and intracranial arterial stenosis. Epiaortic ultrasound was performed at the time of surgery to assess for atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta. Cognitive status was measured using the Hasegawa-dementia score in all patients before surgery and on the seventh postoperative day.Women were older and had more hypertension and intracranial arterial stenosis than did men. Men had significantly higher rates of hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, smoking history, severe carotid artery stenosis, and severe aortic atherosclerosis than did women. Although there were no differences in prior cerebral infarction or preoperative cognitive impairment, the rate of perioperative stroke was marginally higher in men than in women (3.9% vs 1.3%, P = 0.066). Univariate predictors of perioperative stroke were prior cerebral infarctions, ascending aortic atherosclerosis, preexisting cognitive impairment, and peripheral vascular disease. Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that significant independent predictors of perioperative stroke were prior cerebral infarctions and aortic atherosclerosis.These data suggest that men are more likely than women to have risk factors for stroke, including severe carotid artery stenosis, severe aortic atherosclerosis, and peripheral vascular disease. The rates of prior cerebral infarction and preoperative cognitive impairment were similar between genders."Stroke	Epidemiology	"The 1994 to 1997 administrative data on 40 450 elderly Medicare beneficiaries and general population of 2 states were used to measure ""case mortality"" (deaths attributable to any cause among cases of acute stroke), ""case fatality"" (deaths caused by cerebrovascular diseases among cases of acute stroke), and ""population mortality"" (deaths caused by stroke in the elderly general population). Mortality was higher in men than in women according to all measures except population mortality caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage. There was no sex difference in 1-year case fatality. One-year all-cause mortality among cases of nonhemorrhagic stroke or all types of stroke was higher in men than in women. Similar sex differences were found in 4-year population mortality caused by nonhemorrhagic stroke or all types of stroke combined. The 3 measures differed with respect to sex difference in stroke mortality. How stroke is defined and how mortality is measured does affect sex difference."Stroke	Review	"To determine the impact of statin therapy on the combined endpoint of cardiovascular events in women and men separately.A systematic literature search through May 2006 was conducted to identify randomized, controlled statin trials evaluating the gender specific incidence of cardiovascular events. Weighted averages were reported as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated via random-effects model.The primary outcome measured was a composite endpoint of all cardiovascular events. Secondary outcomes measured included death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke.Fifteen trials were included in this meta-analysis. Cardiovascular events were reduced in men (RR 0.76 [95% CI 0.70, 0.81]) and women (RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.69, 0.90]). Reductions in mortality, MI, and stroke predominantly contributed to the reduction in cardiovascular events in men taking statins. Women did not have a reduction in mortality or stroke, suggesting that the reductions in cardiac events may have been predominantly due to reductions in need for revascularization and/or unstable angina.Statins reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in men and women, but women on statins may not have reductions in mortality and stroke like their male counterparts."Stroke	Management	"Sex differences in the management of acute coronary symptoms are well documented. We sought to determine whether sex disparities exist in acute stroke management, particularly with regard to early hospital admission and thrombolytic therapy.We analyzed a prospective, countywide, hospital-based stroke registry. Between 1999 and 2005, all cases with a final diagnosis of cerebral infarction (ICD-10 I63) or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICD-10 I61) were selected. Datasets with missing values for sex and time to admission, as well as datasets of patients transferred between hospitals in the acute phase, were excluded. Main outcome measures were the probability of being admitted within the first 3 hours of stroke onset and being treated with thrombolytic agents for both women and men, after adjustment for age, prestroke disability, severity of clinical symptoms, vascular risk factors, and final diagnosis.Fifty-three thousand four hundred fourteen patients were included (49.3% female; mean+/-SD age, 72.1+/-12.5 years). Women had a 10% lower chance of being admitted within the first 3 hours than men (odds ratio=0.902, 95% CI=0.860 to 0.945, P<0.001). This chance further decreased in elderly women. Similarly, the chance of a female stroke patient being treated with thrombolysis was 13% lower than that of a male patient (odds ratio=0.867, 95% CI=0.782 to 0.960, P=0.006). For patients admitted within the 3-hour time window, the chance of being treated with thrombolysis was similar for women and men (odds ratio=0.915, 95% CI=0.809 to 1.035, P=0.156).We identified sex disparities in acute stroke management in terms of early hospital admission and thrombolytic treatment. This is best explained by the sociodemographic fact that ""surviving spouses"" are more likely to be women than men. Attempts to overcome disadvantages in their access to acute stroke care should focus on increased social support."Stroke	Clinical	"The purpose of the study was to assess whether there were sex differences in stroke severity, infarct characteristics, symptoms, or the symptoms-deficit relationship at the time of acute stroke presentation.In a prospective study of 505 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke (the Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study), stroke subtype was centrally adjudicated and infarcts were characterized by imaging. Deficits were assessed by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and stroke symptoms were assessed using a structured interview. Kappa statistics were generated to assess agreement between the NIHSS and the structured interview, and a Chi square test was used to assess agreement between the NIHSS and the structured interview by sex.In all, 276 patients (55%) were men and 229 (45%) were women. Ages ranged from 19 to 94 years (median, 65 years). The mean (+/-SD) NIHSS score of 3.8 (+/-4.5) for men and 4.3 (+/-5.2) for women was similar (P = .15). No sex difference was observed for the symptoms of numbness, visual deficits, or language. Weakness occurred in a greater proportion of women (69%) than men (59%) (P = .03). Stroke subtype did not differ significantly between sexes (P = .79). Infarct size and location were similar for each sex. The association between symptoms and neurologic deficits did not differ by sex.We found no sex difference in stroke severity, stroke subtype, or infarct size and location in patients with incident ischemic stroke. A greater proportion of women presented with weakness; however, similar proportions of men and women presented with other traditional stroke symptoms."Stroke	Clinical	"Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is a LDL-particle linked to apoprotein (a) [apo(a)]. High Lp(a) plasma level is a risk factor for coronary heart disease and, in older men, for ischemic stroke. The role of Lp(a) as a risk factor for ischemic stroke in young adults is uncertain.Lp(a) concentration was prospectively measured in 100 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke (58 men and 42 women) aged 18-55 years, and in 100 controls matched for age and gender.The distribution of Lp(a) concentration was skewed toward the highest and median tertiles in male patients. In multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusting on classical risk factors for ischemic stroke and lipid variables, Lp(a) concentration in the highest and medium tertiles compared with the lowest tertile was significantly associated with ischemic stroke in men (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.33-9.48, p = 0.012), but was not in women (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.14-1.26, p = 0.12). Although large vessel atherosclerosis was more common in men than in women, there were no differences in Lp(a) concentration according to the cause of ischemic stroke.Among subjects aged 18-55 years, a slightly elevated Lp(a) concentration was strongly and independently associated with ischemic stroke in men, but not in women. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this gender-specific association."Stroke	Outcomes	"The aim of this prospective study was to identify factors that are associated with stroke survivors' own perception of their impairments in various domains.104 patients were examined twice, both on admission to rehabilitation treatment and one year later.Multiple linear regression analyses were used: Gender, age, diagnosis, location, Barthel Index and depression served as predictor variables. The perceived impairments were established with the Patient Competency Rating.Patients' initial depression was identified as being the main predictor for perceived impairment. Gender differences were also found; men were seen to have suffered from a considerable increase in perceived impairment.Patients' self-reports can be used as a valid measurement of their disabilities in various domains. The impact of depression and the gender differences indicate that rehabilitation should focus more strongly on interventions that promote emotional coping and reduce depressive symptoms."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP) feature an established model for human cerebrovascular disease. SHRSP, kept on a high-salt permissive diet (JPD), develop hypertension, renal and brain damage. In this report we compared the behavior of female and male SHRSP regarding the main aspects of their pathological condition. Brain abnormalities, detected by magnetic resonance imaging, developed spontaneously in males after 42+/-3 days, in females after 114+/-14 days from the start of JPD. Survival was >3-fold longer for females than for males. The development of brain damage was preceded, in both genders, by an inflammatory condition characterized by the accumulation in serum and urine of acute-phase proteins. The increase in thiostatin level was significantly lower and delayed in female in comparison to male SHRSP. During JPD female and male SHRSP developed massive proteinuria, its worsening being significantly slower in females. The alterations of vasculature-bound barriers in kidney and brain were connected with endothelial dysfunction and relative deficiency in nitric oxide (NO). In thoracic aortic rings, basal release of NO was significantly higher in female than in male SHRSP, both if receiving and if not receiving JPD. The gender differences in SHRSP thus appear to be connected to a more efficient control in females of inflammation and of endothelial dysfunction."Stroke	Outcomes	"To study the relationship between sex differences among men and women in the response to pain and the effect on satisfaction with quality of life (QOL) in poststroke patients approximately 90 days after discharge from inpatient medical rehabilitation.Cross-sectional design.Community based.The sample included 1724 patients (877 men, 847 women) aged 40 years and older with a history of stroke, according to information obtained from the IT HealthTrack database. The average age was 68.7 years; 79.3% were non-Hispanic white.Not applicable.Satisfaction with QOL.Pain ratings for both the men and the women were significant and inversely associated with satisfaction with QOL after adjustments for possible confounding factors. However, among men with stroke, each 1-point increase in pain rating was associated with an 18% decreased odds of being satisfied with QOL (odds ratio [OR], .81; 95% confidence interval [CI], .77-.86). Conversely, among women with stroke, each 1-point increase in pain rating was associated with an 11% decreased odds of being satisfied with QOL (OR=.89; 95% CI, .84-.95).Our data indicate that pain after stroke is significantly associated with reduced satisfaction with QOL, particularly among men. Increased awareness and treatment of pain may improve satisfaction with QOL. Our findings suggest that sex differences and pain response are clinically important factors in examining satisfaction with QOL in the poststroke population."Stroke	Management	"Recent studies have reported sex differences in recanalization and outcome after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in acute ischemic stroke.We analyzed sex differences in outcome in consecutive patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 or M2 and internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT). Recanalization immediately after thrombolysis and outcome after 3 months were assessed.Two hundred five patients (111 men) with MCA and 43 (22 men) with ICA occlusion were identified. Baseline variables did not differ between the sexes except for a higher prevalence of smokers among men in the MCA group (31% vs 12%; P=0.001). Partial or complete recanalization (TIMI flow 2 or 3) of the MCA was observed in 71 (75%) women and 80 (72%) men (P=0.488). In the ICA group, 14 (67%) women and 11 men (50%) showed TIMI 2 or 3 recanalization (P=0.425). Favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2) was seen in 57 women (61%) and 63 men (57%) with MCA occlusion (P=0.512) and in 6 women (28%) and 4 men (18%) with ICA occlusion (P=0.656). After multiple-regression analyses, there was still no association between sex and outcome (P=0.763 for MCA and P=0.813 for ICA occlusion) or recanalization (P=0.488 for MCA and P=0.104 for ICA occlusion).There was no association between sex and recanalization or outcome after IAT. These findings are in contrast to previous studies reporting better recanalization and outcome after IVT in women and might have implications in the selection of patients for IAT or IVT."Stroke	Outcomes	"To assess the age, period, and cohort effects on stroke mortality in Belgrade, Serbia, between 1989 and 2003.Mortality data for stroke events were obtained from the Municipal Institute of Statistics. The age- and gender-specific mortality rates were calculated for the cohorts of individuals born between 1904-1908 and 1964-1968.In males, the average mortality rate increased from 80.9/100,000 in 1989-1993 to 111.3/100,000 in 1994-1998, and decreased slightly to 101.8/100,000 in 1999-2003. A similar pattern was observed among females. Stroke mortality risk was strongly related to age in both genders. This age effect was present for both genders, independent of the cohort or time period. The majority of the successive generations in Belgrade had an increased risk of death from stroke in the recent cohorts especially among females.Our results suggest the need to improve efforts in the primary and secondary prevention of stroke."Stroke	Outcomes	"The therapeutic armamentarium for vascular risk factors in industrialized countries improved over the past decades. We therefore studied vascular mortality trends in France between 1979 and 2001, and explored how these trends are related to stroke or nonstroke vascular mortality changes.We included all deaths from vascular disease in the French population from 1979 to 2001. Trends for total, stroke and nonstroke vascular mortality were estimated using log-linear Poisson regression models. Gender-specific mortality rates were standardized directly by 5-year groups to the 1990 French population.During the 1979-2001 period, the mean annual percentage change in vascular death rates varied across age groups (<35, 35-54, 55-64, 65-74, >or=75) between -2.4 to -3.3% in men and -2.5 to -4.1% in women. Respectively, 25.7 and 30.9% of total vascular death was attributed to cerebrovascular disease in men and women. Stroke mortality and nonstroke vascular mortality rates declined respectively by 60.9 and 34.6% in men, and 60.4 and 38.9% in women.We observed a dramatic 60% reduction of stroke death in France in the last 20 years. Stroke death decreased at about twice the rate as other causes of vascular death. Improved management of vascular risk factors could partly explain these results."Stroke	Epidemiology	"We sought to confirm previous studies for the presence and direction of sex and race difference in stroke mortality.Administrative data for 40,450 Medicare beneficiaries who were hospitalized in 1994 to 1996 with acute stroke were used in regression analyses to study sex and race differences in 1-year all-cause mortality among patients with different types of stroke and cause-specific mortality in patients with all types of stroke combined. Hazard ratios were adjusted for age, sex or race, state, year of index stroke, past stroke, subsequent stroke, and fatal coexisting conditions excluding cerebrovascular diseases.Men with ischemic cerebral infarction, nonspecific stroke, or all types of stroke combined were at 21% to 35% higher risk of all-cause mortality than women, but there was no sex difference among patients with subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage. Nonwhite patients with ischemic cerebral infarction had 11% higher all-cause mortality than white patients, but there were no race differences after adjustments for fatal coexisting conditions. Compared with women, mortality was higher in men with all types of stroke regardless of the cause of death. There was higher risk of death caused by cerebrovascular diseases in white patients with all types of stroke combined, but the risk of death caused by cardiovascular diseases other than ischemic heart disease was higher in nonwhite patients.There was no sex or race difference in all-cause mortality in patients with hemorrhagic stroke and higher risk in men with ischemic and nonspecific stroke. Relatively higher risk of mortality caused by cerebrovascular diseases was found in men and white patients."Stroke	Management	"Sex influences outcome after intravenous thrombolysis. In a combined analysis of the tissue plasminogen activator clinical trials, a sex-by-treatment interaction was observed. We sought to confirm that observation in an independent data set.Data were from the Pro-Urokinase for Acute Cerebral Thromboembolism-2 (PROACT-2) trial. Baseline factors were compared by sex. The primary outcome was an assessment of a sex-by-treatment interaction term within a logistic regression model, using a modified Rankin Scale score <or=2 at 90 days as the binary outcome. We also assessed whether there were differences in CT-scan appearance and recanalization at 2 hours post-treatment.In the PROACT-2 study of intra-arterial stroke thrombolysis, in both women and men, prourokinase resulted in better outcomes than control. A sex by prourokinase treatment interaction was observed, with women showing a larger treatment effect (20% absolute benefit) compared with men (10% absolute benefit). The reason for this interaction is that thrombolytic treatment nullifies the worse outcome for untreated women compared with men. The reasons for effect modification do not include improved recanalization at 2 hours among women.Women with middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke benefit more from intra-arterial therapy. Further study of how sex affects stroke outcome is needed."Stroke	Management	"We wished to ascertain whether a new contract based on financial incentives for general practitioners has been associated with improved recording of quality indicators for patients with stroke and whether there was evidence of any difference in change between sex, age, and deprivation groups.In a serial cross-sectional study, patients from 310 general practices with a computer record of transient ischemic attack or stroke in Scotland were analyzed for their recording of quality indicators before and after the introduction of a new quality-based contract on March 31, 2004. Multivariate analyses were used to explore any differences in recording between age, sex, and deprivation groups.Documentation of quality indicators increased over time, with absolute increases for individual indicators ranging from 32.3% to 52.1%. There was a large increase in the documentation of quality indicators among the oldest patients (>75 years) and the most affluent patients. This tended to attenuate age groups differences and to exacerbate differences between deprivation groups. Women tended to have larger increases in documentation than men; however, sex differences persisted, with women less likely than men to have smoking habits recorded (adjusted odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 0.95) or to receive antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.99).The recording and management of quality indicators among patients with stroke increased substantially. However, inequitable care exists, which may have important implications for female, older, and more deprived subgroups in terms of stroke recurrence and mortality."Stroke	Outcomes	"We compared subjective responses to simple questions after stroke with interviewer-assessed stroke outcome measures. Among those in the highest functional category, women were more likely to report incomplete recovery and greater need for help than men. Among these women, depressed mood was associated with a response of a need for help despite a good functional recovery. Self-reported responses in stroke outcome assessments require further validation by gender and may need to consider the confounding effects of depression."Stroke	Review	"Stroke is a leading cause of death and serious, long-term disability. Studies evaluating differences between men and women are lacking. Significant differences exist between men and women in terms of risk factors and susceptibility to stroke. Women are less likely to have diagnostic studies performed to evaluate their risk for stroke, and they have a higher mortality following acute stroke. Women however, have a higher rate of arterial recanalization after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator used for the treatment of acute stroke. The data comparing the effectiveness of treatments for prevention of recurrent stroke between men and women is sparse. There have not been any studies comparing results of treatment of musculoskeletal impairments in men and women after stroke."Stroke	Outcomes	"To determine racial and gender differences in long-term survival following ischemic stroke in a well-defined cohort of patients.We analyzed the prospectively collected data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with ischemic stroke presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset. We determined the effect of race and gender on 1-year survival ascertained by serial follow-ups using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed adjusting for age, initial NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, use of thrombolysis, time to randomization, stroke etiology, and other cardiovascular risk factors.Of the 547 patients with ischemic stroke, the 1-year survival (percentage +/- SE) for African American women (63 +/- 6%) was lower than white women (73 +/- 4%), African American men (79 +/- 4%), and white men (75 +/- 3%). Among the 209 patients younger than 65 years, the 1-year survival was prominently lower for African American women (66 +/- 8%) vs white women (87 +/- 5%), African American men (83 +/- 5%), and white men (89 +/- 3%). In the Cox proportional hazard analysis, African American women had a significantly higher rate of 1-year mortality (relative risk 2.1, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.5) after adjusting for all potential confounders except diabetes mellitus. After adjustment for diabetes mellitus, the difference became insignificant, although a 70% greater risk of 1-year mortality was still observed.Compared with whites and men, African American women have a lower 1-year survival following ischemic stroke."Stroke	Management	"There is substantial interpatient variability in response to aspirin after an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), as assessed by ex vivo effects of aspirin on platelet aggregation. The factors contributing to this variability are not well defined.To determine whether demographic, social, or clinical characteristics are associated with ex vivo response to aspirin in patients with a history of stroke or TIA.Eighty-one patients who were taking aspirin for secondary stroke prevention and underwent ex vivo platelet aggregation studies were identified. The medical records of eligible patients were reviewed by clinicians who specialize in the management of stroke patients. Characteristics were compared between 45 patients who had a complete response to aspirin and 36 patients who exhibited an incomplete (partial) response to aspirin based on the results of platelet aggregation testing.The median (range) aspirin dose was similar in complete (325; 81-1950 mg/day) and partial (325; 81-1300 mg/day) responders. There was no association between aspirin response and age, race, body mass index, medical history, smoking status, or use of statin or hormone replacement therapy. However, sex was significantly associated with response to aspirin, with more women in the partial versus complete responder group (75% vs 49%; p = 0.02).Our data suggest that aspirin may be less effective at inhibiting platelet aggregation in women compared with men who have a history of ischemic stroke or TIA."Stroke	Epidemiology	"There are many adults with disabilities currently in the United States, yet little is known about how gender differences affect stroke risk factors in this population. This article presents a descriptive study that was designed to determine whether males and females living with disabilities differ in self-reported rates of stroke risk factors. Data were collected at conferences and meetings targeted for people living with disabilities. There were 146 participants; 54% were female; and the mean age was 58 years. The primary instrument was the Stroke Risk Screening tool. Stroke risk factors that differed significantly by gender include the incidence of hypertension (48% of men versus 32% of women), current smoking (30% men versus 4% women), history of heart disease (13% men versus 1% women), daily consumption of alcohol (10% men versus 1% women), and use of illicit drugs (10% men versus 0% women). Rehabilitation nurses should focus on earlier assessment of stroke risk factors and appropriate interventions, especially with men living with disabilities."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"We have previously shown that treatment with selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist BRL 52537 hydrochloride [(+/-)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) acetyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) methylpiperidine] (1) has a long therapeutic window for providing ischemic neuroprotection and (2) attenuates ischemia-evoked nitric oxide (NO) production in vivo in rats. Neuronally derived NO has been shown to be deleterious in the male, but not in the female, rodent model of focal ischemic stroke. We sought to determine if the agent fails to protect ischemic brain when neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) is genetically deleted in male, but not female, mice. Halothane-anesthetized adult male and female nNOS null mutants (nNOS(-/-)) and the genetically matched wildtype (WT) strain were subjected to transient (2 h) middle cerebral artery occlusion by the intraluminal filament technique. Vehicle or BRL 52537 treatment with continuous intravenous infusion was instituted at the onset of reperfusion and continued for 22 h. In WT male mice, infarct volumes measured at 72 h of reperfusion were robustly decreased with BRL 52537 treatment. In contrast, BRL 52537 did not decrease infarct volume in male nNOS(-/-) mice. BRL 52537 had no effect in the WT or nNOS(-/-) female mice. These data support that BRL 52537's mechanism of neuroprotection in vivo is through attenuation of nNOS activity and ischemia-evoked NO production. Neuroprotective effects of BRL 52537 are lost in the male when nNOS is not present; therefore, BRL 52537 likely acts upstream from NO generation and its subsequent neurotoxicity."Stroke	Outcomes	"To examine living setting and need for ADL assistance before and one year after a first-ever stroke with special focus on gender differences.One-year survivors from a population-based stroke study (n = 377) were studied with regard to place of living, need for ADL assistance and who provided the help. Stroke severity, cognitive impairment, post-stroke depression as well as risk factors were evaluated.Before the stroke 48 patients (13%) lived in special housing (service flats or nursing homes), and one year after the stroke, 50 of the survivors (20%) lived in such accommodations. Before the stroke, 80 (21%) of the patients needed help with their personal ADL, while 90 (36%) needed help after one year. The increased need was fulfilled by relatives. Female spouses more often helped their male counterparts, and they tended to accept a heavier burden. Age, living alone, stroke severity, cognitive impairment, pre-stroke ADL dependency and depression were predictors for special housing.In a time when more and more stroke survivors are cared for at home, it is important to pay attention to the situation of the caregivers. Female caregivers seem to be in an especially exposed position by accepting a heavier burden."Stroke	Management	"Women are less likely than men to receive some stroke care interventions. It is not known whether gender differences in patient preferences explain some of the observed variations in stroke care delivery.Outpatients with and without a history of cerebrovascular disease were recruited from stroke, vascular, and general internal medicine ambulatory clinics between September 2002 and October 2003. Self-administered surveys described hypothetical scenarios, and participants were asked if they would accept therapy with thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke or carotid endarterectomy for secondary stroke prevention. The surveys also included questions on sociodemographic factors and decision-making preferences.A total of 586 patients (45% women) completed the survey. Women were less likely than men to accept thrombolysis (79% vs. 86%, P=0.014), even after adjustment for other factors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.92). Women and men were equally likely to accept carotid endarterectomy (82% vs. 84%, P=0.502), even after adjustment for other factors (adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.58- 1.53). Women were less confident in their decisions, were more risk averse, and would have preferred more information to assist them in their decision-making.No gender differences were found in patient preferences for carotid surgery. However, we observed gender differences in patient preferences for thrombolysis and in general attitudes toward stroke care decision-making. Health care providers should be aware that, compared with men, women may be more concerned about risks and may require more information before they make a decision."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Our study sought to estimate the incidence rate of first-ever ischemic stroke (FEIS) in the geographically well-defined population of the Canton Basle-City, Switzerland. An one-year prospective population-based study among the permanent residents of the Canton Basle-City (188015 inhabitants, census 2002) was carried out. Multiple overlapping sources of information were used. Stroke was defined according to the WHO criteria. The diagnosis of FEIS was based on clinical assessment and neuroimaging findings. 269 patients (114 males; mean age 72.8, standard deviation (SD) +/- 12 and 155 females; mean age 78.4, SD +/- 11) with FEIS were identified. The overall crude incidence of FEIS amounted to 143 per 100000 population (95% confidence interval (CI) 126 to 160) and it was higher among females (156; 95% CI 132 to 181) than in males (128; 95% CI 105 to 152). The age-specific incidence rates of FEIS approximately doubled with each decade of life, increasing from 17 (95 % CI 2 to 31) among 0-44 years old group to 1034 (95% CI 774 to 1293) for those aged 85 or more years. The overall incidence rate of FEIS adjusted for age to the European standard population was 76 per 100000 inhabitants (95% CI 66 to 86) and it was higher in males-89, 95% CI 72-106-than in females-66, 95 % CI 53-77. Moreover, in comparison with studies from other developed countries (e. g. Germany, Italy, Australia)-carried out in the middle of 1990s-the standardised incidence rates of FEIS were substantially lower in Switzerland. Our results indicate that the risk of ischemic stroke might be low in Switzerland. However, giving a major reduction in the age and gender specific stroke incidence over the past years our findings might-alternatively-mirror this favourable trend."Stroke	Management	"Little is known about the relative efficacy of supervised versus unsupervised community exercise programs for stroke survivors. This study compared the effectiveness of a 10-week supervised strengthening and conditioning program (supervised) with a 1-week supervised instruction program followed by a 9-week unsupervised home program (unsupervised) and evaluated retention of changes at 6 months and 1 year after program completion.Seventy-two subjects retained at baseline (27 women, 45 men; mean+/-SD age, 64.6+/-11.8 years) were randomly allocated to receive the supervised or unsupervised program. The primary outcome was walking speed over 6 minutes, and secondary outcome measures were Human Activity Profile, Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short-Form survey (SF-36), Physiological Cost Index, and lower extremity muscle strength.The 6-minute walking speed increased significantly in both groups and remained significantly improved by 1 year. The Human Activity Profile demonstrated an increasing trend only in the supervised group that was significant by 1 year. The SF-36 Physical Component summary score increased significantly in the supervised group and remained improved by 1 year; the unsupervised group showed significant improvement at 1 year. Women made greater gains in supervised programs, but men made greater gains in unsupervised programs.Supervised exercise programs and unsupervised programs after initial supervised instruction were both associated with physical benefits that were retained for 1 year, although supervised programs showed trends to greater improvements in self-reported gains. Gender differences require further research."Stroke	Review	"Given the increased lifetime risk of stroke and worse stroke outcomes in women, it is imperative to improve access to acute stroke therapy in the female population.The goals of this review were to analyze data comparing IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) use by sex, examine the literature regarding barriers to acute stroke therapy in women, and suggest areas for future research to improve understanding of these barriers as well as access in this population.The authors reviewed the MEDLINE literature (using the terms: stroke, women, gender, sex, tissue plasminogen activator, barriers, knowledge, risk factors, recognition, awareness, delay, presentation, access, and symptoms in various combinations) from January 1, 1996, through February 28, 2006, identified by various search strategies and the reference lists of retrieved articles.Some evidence suggests that there may be less utilization of IV tPA in women compared with men. Stroke knowledge remains low for both sexes, but little is known about the recognition and translation of stroke symptoms in women. Although sex differences in out-of-hospital delays are not widespread, there is some evidence to suggest that, due to in-hospital delays during acute stroke, access to care may be more problematic for women. Overall, barriers to acute stroke therapy in women are not well understood.tPA utilization is poor overall and may be poorer still in women than in men. Future research is needed to understand women's response to specific stroke symptoms, to elucidate sex differences in acute stroke symptom presentation, to determine reasons for in-hospital delays in women with stroke, and to understand sex-specific differences in response to acute stroke therapy. These research results may then aid in the development of intervention strategies that target women and affect physicians' decisions regarding the use of tPA in this population."Stroke	Review	"Increasing evidence suggests that inflammatory response may be a critical component of different brain pathologies. However, the role played by this reaction is not fully understood. The present findings suggest that neuroinflammtory mediators such as cytokines may be involved in a number of key steps in the pathological cascade of events leading to neuronal injury. This hypothesis is strongly supported by experimental and clinical observations indicating that inhibition of the inflammatory reaction correlates with less neuronal damage. Estrogens are thought to play a role in the sex difference observed in many neurological diseases with inflammatory components including stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Clinical and experimental studies have established estrogen as a neuroprotective hormone in these diseases. However, the exact mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effects of estrogens are still unclear. It is possible that the beneficial effects of these hormones may be dependent on their inhibitory activity on the inflammatory reaction associated with the above-mentioned brain pathologies. Here, we review the current clinical and experimental evidence with respect to the inflammation-modulating effects of estrogens as one potential explanatory factor for sexual dimorzphism in the prevalence of numerous neurological diseases."Stroke	Management	"Recently, we reported that erythropoietin attenuates neonatal brain injury caused by focal cerebral ischemia. The long-term effects of erythropoietin on focal cerebral ischemia-induced injury to the developing brain and the potential gender differences in these long-term effects have not been studied in detail. The current study demonstrated a similarity in the mean infarct volume in both the vehicle-treated male and female rats at 6 and 12 weeks after focal cerebral ischemia. On the other hand, erythropoietin treatment (1000 U/kg x three doses after focal cerebral ischemia) caused a significant reduction in the mean infarct volume in both males and females at 6 weeks after focal cerebral ischemia when compared with the corresponding vehicle-treated animals (males: 141.4+/-48.2 mm3 vs. 194.0+/-59.2 mm3, P<0.05; females: 85.4+/-31.6 mm3 vs. 183.4+/-46.3 mm3, P<0.05). Interestingly, the reduction in the mean infarct volume in the erythropoietin-treated males was significantly less than that in the erythropoietin-treated females at 6 weeks after focal cerebral ischemia (141.4+/-48.2 mm3 vs. 85.4+/-31.6 mm3, P<0.05). At 12 weeks after focal cerebral ischemia, the mean infarct volume in the erythropoietin-treated males significantly increased to 181.0+/-50.4 mm3 (P<0.05). In contrast, the mean infarct volume in the erythropoietin-treated females remained stable (87.0+/-41.7 mm3). Additionally, erythropoietin treatment significantly improved sensorimotor function recovery with a misstep number similar to the sham-operation group at 6 and 12 weeks after focal cerebral ischemia. Moreover, the mean number of missteps in the erythropoietin-treated females was less than that in males at 6 (13.5+/-2.0 vs. 24.5+/-2.5, P<0.05) and 12 (12.5+/-2.0 vs. 20.0+/-2.0, P<0.05) weeks after focal cerebral ischemia. These results indicate that erythropoietin administration after focal cerebral ischemia produces a significant long-term neuroprotective benefit on the developing brain, and that this effect is more beneficial in the female rats."Stroke	Epidemiology	"This study assessed gender differences in diabetic patients with ischemic stroke with respect to vascular risk factors, clinical features and early outcome. Ischemic stroke was diagnosed in 261 diabetic women and 300 diabetic men of 2,446 ischemic stroke patients included in a prospective stroke registry over 17 years. Mean +/- SD age was 77.5 +/- 8.3 years in women and 71.8 +/- 9.7 years in men (p < 0.021). Risk factors for stroke including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure and valvular heart disease were significantly more common in women. Cardioembolic infarction occurred in 29.5% of women and 15.3% of men (p < 0.001), and lacunar stroke in 40.3% of men and 29.9% of women (p < 0.006). In-hospital mortality was 14.9% in diabetic women, and 8.3% in diabetic men (p < 0.02). After multivariate analysis, congestive heart failure (OR = 4.59), frontal lobe involvement (OR = 2.67), hypertension (OR = 1.62) and age were independent variables for ischemic stroke in diabetic women. Diabetic women had a poor prognosis, which may be due to differences in age, comorbidity and stroke subtype distribution."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Although women have a greater lifetime risk of stroke than men, along with other gender differences in stroke, there is lack of reliable data on long-term trends in stroke in women. This paper presents the results of three population-based registers in Auckland (1981-1982, 1991-1992, and 2002-2003) which aimed to determine the trends in the incidence of stroke in New Zealand. This paper reports on the burden of stroke in women across different ethnic groups over the study period from 1981 to 2003.Three studies using similar methodology and overlapping case finding methods have been conducted in New Zealand to estimate trends in the incidence and outcome of stroke. The studies are recognised as meeting the 'ideal' criteria for stroke incidence and identify all first-ever and recurrent strokes in residents (aged greater than and equal to 15 years) the population of Auckland, New Zealand in the 12-month periods from 1981-1982, 1991-1992, and 2002-2003. There were totals of 307,578 strokes among women in 1981, 372,642 in 1991, and 470,727 in 2001, according to each Census representing over 50% of the population at each period (51%-54%). The WHO standard world population was used for direct age standardisation of annual rates (per 100,000 population), reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI).The proportion of women who have experienced a stroke did not change markedly over the study period but there were ethnic differences emerging which were related to population changes within the New Zealand population. Standardised stroke incidence in women was relatively stable across the three study periods (1981-1982), 133 [95% CI 118-151]; (1991-1992), 143 [95% CI 116-241]; and (2002-2003), 124 [95% CI 115-134]). However, a significant decline of 14% (95% CI 2%-29%) in rates of first-ever stroke was found between 1991-1992 and 2002-2003 in women. In contrast to the significant declines in event rates in European women over two decades (Rate ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.96), increasing trends in event rates in Pacific women were observed (2.71 95% CI 1.00-7.29). The rate of stroke for Maori women did not change significantly over time. Over half of the women who had a stroke event reported that they had high blood pressure; one in four reported that they had diabetes. The proportion of women who smoked declined over time but increases in body mass index (BMI) indicated weight gains in women over time. These trends were consistent across ethnic groups. Women's survival after 1 month following their stroke has improved by 39% (p<0.0001) over the 20-year period. Favourable changes in early survival were most pronounced in European women.There was a modest decline in stroke incidence in women (overall and for New Zealand European women in particular) in Auckland over the past 20 years but there also was a trend towards increasing stroke incidence in Maori, Pacific, and Asian women. These divergent trends are likely to be associated with different trends in the prevalence of risk factors in these ethnic populations. Targeted stroke prevention programmes are needed in New Zealand to meet the needs of specific ethnic groups as well as the needs of providing ongoing care and support to women following their stroke."Stroke	Outcomes	"Although diverging, most studies show that sex has no significant influence on stroke survival.In a Copenhagen, Denmark, community all patients with stroke during March 1992 to November 1993 were registered on hospital admission. Stroke severity was measured using the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (0-58); computed tomography determined stroke type. A risk factor profile was obtained for all including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Date of death was obtained within a 10-year follow-up period. Predictors of death were identified using a Cox proportional hazards model.Of 999 patients, 559 (56%) were women and 440 (44%) were men. Women were older (77.0 v 70.9 years; P < .001) and had more severe strokes (Scandinavian Stroke Scale: 36.1 v 40.5; P < .001). Age-adjusted risk factors showed no difference between sexes for ischemic heart disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke. Men more often were smokers and alcohol consumers. Unadjusted survival in men and women did not differ: 70.3% versus 66.7% (1-year), 40.0% versus 38.9% (5-year), and 17.4% versus 18.7% (10-year), respectively. Adjusting for age, stroke severity, stroke type, and risk factors, women had a higher probability of survival at 1 year (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.10-2.00); 5 years (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.23-1.76); and 10 years (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.28-1.76). Before 9 months poststroke, no difference in survival was seen. Severity of stroke had the same effect on sex.Stroke is equally severe in men and women. Short-term survival is the same. Having survived stroke, women, however, live longer."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Sixty-two percent of all stroke deaths in the United States occur in women. We compared diagnostic evaluations by gender in ischemic stroke patients in a biethnic, population-based study.A random sample of patients with ischemic stroke identified between 2000 and 2002 by BASIC (Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi Project) were selected for this study (n = 381). Gender differences in the use of stroke diagnostic tests were assessed. Separate multivariable logistic regression models predicting diagnostic test use were constructed, adjusted for age, ethnicity, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, history of stroke, coronary artery disease, having a primary care provider, discharge disposition, modified Rankin Scale score at discharge, and insurance status.The study population consisted of 161 men and 220 women. Median age was 74.3 years. The respective proportions of males and females receiving any carotid artery evaluation were 71% and 62%; brain MRI, 43% and 41%; echocardiography, 57% and 48%; and EKG, 90% and 86%. Multivariable logistic models found that women were less likely to undergo echocardiography (odds ratio [OR] 0.64, CI: 0.42 to 0.98) and carotid evaluation (OR 0.57, CI: 0.36 to 0.91). There was no association of ischemic stroke subtype and gender to explain these results (p = 0.76).Despite controlling for explanatory variables, women with stroke were less likely to receive standard diagnostic tests vs men. Intervention is needed to increase access to quality stroke care for women."Stroke	Management	"Coronary events and stroke are leading causes of death in Japan. However, the effects of hypertension on the risk of coronary events and stroke have not been well established in Japanese hypercholesterolemic patients. This study aimed to determine the relationship between the risk of coronary events or stroke and blood pressure and cholesterol levels during low-dose simvastatin treatment using data from the Japan Lipid Intervention Trial (J-LIT) study (a large scale nationwide cohort study). In the present study, 47,294 hypercholesterolemic patients were treated with open-labeled simvastatin (5 to 10 mg/day) for 6 years by a large number of physicians in a clinical setting. The adjusted incidence rates of coronary events in males and females were 8.9 and 2.3 and those of stroke were 17.6 and 11.3/1000 patients during the 6-year period, respectively. The incidence rate of stroke was higher than that of coronary events in both males and females. An obvious sex difference was observed in terms of the incidence of coronary events. The risk of coronary events, stroke, and total cardiovascular events were increased, with elevations in blood pressure observed in patients treated for hypercholesterolemia. The risk of total cardiovascular events in the groups exhibiting less lipid control increased, with lower blood pressure levels than those of the well-controlled group. For patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, blood pressure should be strictly controlled in order to prevent both coronary events and stroke, and the serum total cholesterol levels should be maintained at low levels as well."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Few data are available on sex differences among relatively young adult stroke patients. The aim of the present study is to analyze such differences in mortality, principal risk factors, and outcome measures among patients aged 45-65 with acute stroke. The identification of these differences is indispensable for developing optimal strategies for the prevention and care of this disease.Retrospective study of 114 women and 190 men, aged 45-65 years, hospitalized from 1990 to 1998 in the Hadassah Medical Centers with confirmed CVA. Medical background, clinical presentation, imaging results, risk factors, lifestyle information, and rehabilitative status data were retrieved from medical records. No gender differences were observed in clinical presentation or imaging studies. In-hospital mortality rate among women was higher than men, 13.2% vs. 5.8%. A significant gender gap in comorbidity with diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia was found: 29.1% of women vs. 14.3% of men. Men more than women had a history of ischemic heart disease (35.8% vs. 21.9%) and smoking and alcohol consumption (43.9% vs. 16.4%; 6.9% vs. 0.9%). Use of rehabilitative services was similar between the sexes.This study shows marked gender differences among younger adult stroke patients. The concomitance of multiple risk factors in the women may have contributed to the observed higher mortality rate. Characterization of risk factors for CVA in both sexes may aid in developing prevention strategies to reduce stroke incidence in this age group."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Stroke is a disorder affecting the lives of all age groups, and particularly those at the opposite ends of the age spectrum. It is generally believed that the immature brain is more resistant to damage resulting from a hypoxic/ischemic injury, and that it is also more 'plastic' in terms of its ability to recover. Evidence from our laboratory, and a host of others, has indicated, however, that the developing brain may in fact be more sensitive to injury resulting from hypoxia-ischemia. The question remains, however, whether the immature brain has a greater capacity for recovery. In order to determine the relative capability for functional recovery between age groups, a stroke model of comparable injury is required. This paper describes a new rodent model of ischemic injury allowing for comparisons of behavioral recovery spanning the spectrum of ages between newborn and the elderly. Endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor, was stereotactically injected into the brains of 10-, 63-, and 180-day-old Wistar rats, immediately adjacent to the middle cerebral artery. Regionally, the cortex, caudate, and thalamus were most significantly affected, with sparing of the hippocampus. Pathologic assessment indicated a similar degree of injury across age groups affecting the territorial distribution of the middle cerebral artery, with a predominance of damage in the anterior sections of the cortex and caudate (p < 0.05), compared to the posterior sections including the cortex and thalamus. There were no regional differences in the extent of damage between age groups. Interestingly, however, there were significant differences between males and females regarding the overall extent of brain damage (p < 0.05), with males showing greater damage than females. In addition, there were significant regional differences in the extent of damage between males and females, particularly regarding cortical damage (p < 0.05), both anteriorly and posteriorly, and the caudate anteriorly (p < 0.05). Our findings provide an important new model for comparison of brain damage among the entire spectrum of ages affected by stroke. Importantly, this will allow for further investigations regarding both functional recovery and gender difference comparisons. This may have important ramifications for the development of therapeutic interventions that are age and gender specific."Stroke	Outcomes	"This study examined differences between men and women in the ability to perform basic activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, and higher physical functioning after stroke. The objective of the study was to determine whether sex differences in stroke recovery can be explained by depressive status beyond older age, stroke severity, prestroke physical functioning, and other medical comorbidities.A total of 459 stroke patients were recruited from acute and subacute facilities in an urban midwestern community. These patients were followed prospectively from stroke onset until 6 months poststroke. All study participants were assessed using standardized stroke outcome measures, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index, the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, and the SF-36 Health Survey physical functioning scale. The Geriatric Depression Scale was used to assess depressive status. Each outcome was measured at baseline (within 2 weeks of stroke onset), as well as 1, 3, and 6 months poststroke. Prestroke physical functioning, stroke characteristics, and comorbidities were also assessed at baseline.Female patients in the study were older than male patients, with a mean age of 71 years for women vs 69 years for men. Female patients reported lower prestroke physical functioning than their male counterparts. Six months after stroke, women in the study were less likely than the men to achieve a score of > or = 95 on the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (hazards ratio [HR] = 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.90), carry out eight of nine instrumental activities of daily living without assistance (HR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30-0.68), and score > or = 90 on the SF-36 Health Survey physical functioning scale (HR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.28-1.01). When age, prestroke physical functioning, stroke severity, and depressive status at baseline were controlled in the analysis, women in the study continued to be less likely (HR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32-0.79) than men in the study to be able to carry out eight of nine instrumental activities of daily living completely without assistance, but there were no observed sex differences in achievement of independence in basic activities of daily living or higher physical functioning.Prestroke physical functioning and depressive symptoms are important factors in the investigation of sex differences in stroke recovery. Lower recovery of activities of daily living and physical functioning in women after stroke may be due to multifactorial effects of older age, poor physical function prior to stroke onset, and depressive status after stroke."Stroke	Epidemiology	"A limiting factor for immediate initiation of stroke therapy is delayed hospital arrival. We assessed general knowledge on and behavior during an acute stroke with particular emphasis on prehospital temporal delays and a focus on the high-risk group of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).As part of the Berlin Acute Stroke Study (BASS), we interviewed patients admitted to hospital with symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire. Cardiac rhythm was assessed by ECG and Holter monitor. Data analysis included additional stratification for age and gender.Of a total of 558 patients (66.8 +/- 13.5 years; 45% female) diagnosed with TIA or stroke 28% interpreted their own symptoms correctly as due to stroke. Female patients reporting cardiac arrhythmias and having AF more often correctly interpreted their symptoms as stroke (P = 0.03), considered their symptoms urgent (P = 0.02), considered stroke a medical emergency (P < 0.05) and had shorter prehospital delay times (P = 0.001) compared to female patients not reporting cardiac arrhythmias. Male, younger (< 65 years) and older patient groups showed no such effect, respectively.Females who know to have AF demonstrate better knowledge of stroke symptoms compared to females unaware or without this risk factor. This better knowledge translates into more appropriate behavior during an acute stroke."Stroke	Management	"Previous reports suggest that women achieve better outcome than men after intravenous thrombolysis for ischemic stroke. Coagulation and fibrinolysis differ between sexes. These findings prompted us to investigate possible gender differences in arterial recanalization after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA).We identified 100 consecutive patients who presented with acute ischemic stroke and received IV tPA within 6 hours of onset. Only patients with large artery anterior circulation strokes, as determined by MRI/MRA or CT/CTA before treatment, who had follow-up vascular study within 72 hour after treatment were included. We compared demographics, clinical features, admission medications, symptom-to-needle and treatment-to-repeat vascular imaging times, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Severity score, radiological and laboratory data, stroke mechanism, and outcome between the sexes.39 patients met all inclusion/exclusion criteria (22 men and 17 women). The recanalization rate was significantly higher in women (94% versus 59%; P=0.02). This difference remained statistically significant after excluding patients whose strokes were attributed to internal carotid artery occlusive lesions, and when the analysis was limited to those treated within 3 hours of stroke onset. All other confounding variables did not differ significantly between the sexes.In our cohort, vascular occlusive lesions were more likely to recanalize in women than men in response to IV tPA. These preliminary findings need to be validated in larger prospective studies."Stroke	Management	"We demonstrated previously that treatment with selective kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist BRL 52537 hydrochloride [(+/-)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) acetyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) methylpiperidine] (1) has a long therapeutic window for providing ischemic neuroprotection, and (2) attenuates ischemia-evoked NO production in vivo in rats. Neuronally derived NO has been shown to be deleterious in the male but not in the female rodent model of focal ischemic stroke. We tested the hypothesis that BRL provides significant neuroprotection from transient focal ischemia in male but not in female rats.Halothane-anesthetized adult male and female Wistar rats (250 to 275 g) were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by the intraluminal suture technique. Adequacy of MCAO and reperfusion was monitored with laser-Doppler flowmetry over the ipsilateral parietal cortex. In the first experiment, male and female rats were treated in a blinded randomized fashion with vehicle saline or 1 mg/kg per hour BRL infusion started at the onset of reperfusion and continued for 22 hours. In the second experiment, ovariectomized (OVX) female rats were treated with vehicle or BRL. Infarct volume in the cortex and caudoputamen (CP) complex was assessed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining at 72 hours after MCAO.Infarct volume (percentage of ipsilateral structure; mean+/-SEM) was attenuated significantly in male rats with BRL treatment (cortex 23+/-5%; CP 44+/-6%; n=15) compared with vehicle-treated male rats (cortex 38+/-4%; CP 66+/-4%; n=15) but not in female rats (BRL-cortex 26+/-6; CP 55+/-8%; vehicle-cortex 26+/-5; CP 62+/-5%; n=10 each). Neurologic deficit score was improved in BRL-treated male rats but not in female rats. Infarct volume was not different in OVX female rats treated with vehicle or BRL.These data: (1) demonstrate that this dose of selective KOR agonist provides ischemic neuroprotection in male but not female rats, (2) demonstrate that the lack of protection by BRL is not attributable to circulating ovarian hormones, and (3) highlight the importance of using animal models of both sexes in preclinical studies of experimental ischemia."Stroke	Management	"Women experience worse outcomes after stroke compared with men. Prior work has suggested sex-based differences in coagulation and fibrinolysis markers in subjects with acute stroke. We explored whether sex might modify the effect of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) on outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke.Using a combined database including subjects from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Alteplase Thrombolysis for Acute Noninterventional Therapy in Ischemic Stroke (ATLANTIS) A and B, and the Second European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS II) trials, we examined 90-day outcomes in patients randomized to rtPA versus placebo by sex. We used logistic regression to control for potential confounders.Among 988 women treated between 0 and 6 hours from symptom onset, patients receiving rtPA were significantly more likely than those receiving placebo to have a modified Rankin Score < or =1 (40.5% versus 30.3%, P<0.0008). Among 1190 men, the trend toward benefit in the overall group did not reach statistical significance (38.5% versus 36.7%, P=0.52). An unadjusted analysis showed that women were significantly more likely to benefit from rtPA compared with men (P=0.04). Controlling for age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, diabetes, symptom onset to treatment time, prior stroke, systolic blood pressure, extent of hypoattenuation on baseline computed tomography scan and several significant interaction terms (including onset to treatment time-by-treatment and systolic blood pressure-by treatment) did not substantially change the strength of the interaction between gender and rtPA treatment (P=0.04).In this pooled analysis of rtPA in acute ischemic stroke, women benefited more than men, and the usual gender difference in outcome favoring men was not observed in the thrombolytic therapy group. For patients presenting at later time intervals, when the risks and benefits of rtPA are more finely balanced, sex may be an important variable to consider for patient selection."Stroke	Outcomes	"The aim of the one-year follow-up was to evaluate formal care and the situation of informal caregivers from a gender perspective.The present study targeted elderly persons (n = 147) living in their own homes 12 months after acute stroke, 94 women and 53 men. The median age of the women was 81 years and the men 80 years.A statistically significant gender difference was seen in living conditions. Eighty percent of the women were living alone compared with 28% of the men (CI 48-56%). The informal care given far exceeded that provided by the community: 65% of these elderly people had some kind of informal care and 44% received formal care from the community. There was a gender difference in daily informal personal care, 24% of men and 16% of women (CI 2-18%), and in daily informal household assistance (CI 15-43%). Formal care was provided by the community significantly more frequently to women (56%) than men (23%) (CI 21-45%). The women more frequently had community-based help with house-cleaning (CI 23-39%) and they also more frequently received help with personal care (CI 1-10%).This study showed statistically significant gender differences in the use of informal and formal care. Elderly caregivers' situations must be given greater attention, since informal care to stroke survivors represents a far greater burden than the care that is provided by the community. Most of the caregivers were elderly women, and preventive intervention measures should be developed in order to enable them to manage their everyday lives."Stroke	Management	"Secondary preventive measures play an important role in the reduction of stroke, the third largest cause of death in Scotland. We investigated whether sex, age, or deprivation differences existed in the secondary prevention of stroke in primary care.A retrospective cross-sectional study using a computerized database with 61 practices (377,439 patients) to identify group differences in secondary preventive therapy between March 2003 and April 2004 for 10,076 patients with a diagnosis of any stroke.Women with any stroke were more likely than men to be prescribed a thiazide (odds ratios [OR], 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46 to 1.75) but less likely to be prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.81). Women with ischemic stroke were less likely to receive either an antiplatelet or warfarin (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.94) or statin therapy (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.90) than men. Women with atrial fibrillation received less warfarin (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.81) but more antiplatelet therapy than men (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.68). The oldest patients (older than 75 years) with ischemic stroke received more antiplatelet therapy than the youngest patients (younger than 65 years) (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.64 to 2.06). No significant differences in secondary preventative treatment across deprivation groups were found.Important sex and age differences exist in the care of patients with stroke and suggest that women and the elderly need to be targeted for secondary prevention therapy."Stroke	Outcomes	"Stroke is an important cause of death and disability in women as well as men. However, little is known about sex differences in stroke care and outcomes.The Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network (RCSN) captured data on patients with stroke seen at acute care hospitals across Canada. We used data from phase 1 (July 2001 to February 2002) and phase 2 (June to December 2002) of the RCSN to compare stroke presentation, management, and 6-month outcomes in women and men using multivariable regression techniques to adjust for age and other factors.The study sample included 3323 patients, with 1527 women. Stroke symptoms at presentation were similar in women and men, except that women were more likely to present with headaches and were less likely to have brain stem or cerebellar symptoms. There were no sex differences in the use of neuroimaging, thrombolysis, antithrombotic therapy, or consultations. Women were less likely than men to receive care on an acute stroke unit, but this difference was no longer significant after adjustment for age and other factors. Women were more likely than men to be discharged to long-term care and had greater disability at 6 months. Mortality and quality of life at 6 months were similar in women and men.Among patients participating in the RCSN, there were no major sex differences in stroke presentation or management. Compared with men, women were more often institutionalized and had a slightly worse functional status at 6 months after stroke."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"It is well established that tissue damage and functional outcome after experimental or clinical stroke are shaped by biologic sex. We investigated the novel hypothesis that ischemic cell death from neuronally derived nitric oxide (NO) or poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP-1) activation is sexually dimorphic and that interruption of these molecular death pathways benefits only the male brain. Female neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) knockout (nNOS-/-) mice exhibited exacerbated histological injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) relative to wild-type (WT) females, unlike the protection observed in male nNOS-/- littermates. Similarly, treatment with the nNOS inhibitor (7-nitroindozole, 25 mg/kg) increased infarction in female C57Bl6 WT mice, but protected male mice. The mechanism for this sexually specific response is not mediated through changes in protein expression of endothelial NOS or inducible NOS, or differences in intraischemic cerebral blood flow. Unlike male PARP-1 knockouts (PARP1-/-), female PARP1-/- littermates sustained grossly increased ischemic damage relative to sex-matched WT mice. Treatment with a PARP inhibitor (PJ-34, 10 mg/kg) resulted in identical results. Loss of PARP-1 resulted in reversal of the neuroprotective activity by the female sex steroid, 17beta estradiol. These data suggest that the previously described cell death pathways involving NO and PARP ischemic neurotoxicity may be operant solely in male brain and that the integrity of nNO/PARP-1 signaling is paradoxically protective in the female."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"The aim of this study was to verify the gender difference in sudden cardiovascular death, mainly comparing brain infarction and hemorrhagic stroke. We analyzed 970 autopsy cases from a total of 3,802 nonviolent deaths (448 considered as sudden deaths, 296 undetermined, and 226 non-sudden deaths) including patients aged 30-69 years. All cardiovascular diseases were responsible for 69% of sudden deaths, and all types of stroke for only 14%. The proportions of sudden death for all cardiovascular diseases, coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke deaths were similar for both sexes. However, sudden deaths due to all types of stroke (women 20.0%; men 11.1%; p = 0.012) and hemorrhagic stroke (women 15.6%; men 7.9%; p = 0.019) were significantly more frequent among women when compared to men, the main cause being subarachnoid hemorrhage (women 5.6%; men 1.0%; p = 0.011). Hemorrhagic stroke deaths were usually sudden deaths among women."Stroke	Review	"Epidemiological data emphasize the importance of sex differences in the mortality and morbidity of stroke and cardiovascular disease. The importance of hormonal influences on stroke outcome has pointed out the importance of gender, age, and presence of neural hormones. This clinical data has been substantiated by various experimental studies using clinically relevant models of cerebral ischemia and stroke. Published findings emphasize that male and female animals respond differently to periods of cerebral ischemia and that various combinations of hormonal treatments can provide protection, both histopathological and behavioral. Mechanisms underlying the hormonal effects on ischemic outcome are multifactorial. These include effects on vascular integrity and cerebral blood flow, excitotoxicity, oxidation pathways, inflammation, and apoptosis. Although many studies have shown positive results with hormonal treatments, negative findings have also been presented. Explanations for the limitations of hormonal treatment include uncertainties regarding therapeutic window, specific therapeutic dose range, as well as the specific pathophysiological processes being targeted. Additional studies are therefore required to clarify under what conditions hormonal therapy is most protective or not warranted. Experimental studies utilizing a variety of cerebral ischemia and stroke models are reviewed to indicate under what conditions sex differences and hormonal therapy are most important in terms of functional outcome."Stroke	Epidemiology	"The Copenhagen City Heart Study is a population-based cohort study. Using baseline data from 3 cohort examinations (1976 to 1978, 1981 to 1983, and 1991 to 1994), we analyzed the gender-specific effect of atrial fibrillation (AF) on the risk of stroke and cardiovascular death during 5 years of follow-up. Baseline data from 29,310 subjects were included. AF was documented in 276 subjects (110 women and 166 men). During a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, 635 strokes were identified, 35 of which occurred in subjects who had AF (22 women and 13 men). After adjustment for age and co-morbidity, the effect of AF on the risk of stroke was 4.6-fold greater in women (hazard ratio 7.8, 95% confidence interval 5.8 to 14.3) than in men (hazard ratio 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 3.0). Cardiovascular death occurred in 1,122 subjects, 63 of whom had AF (28 in women and 35 in men). The independent effect of AF on cardiovascular mortality rate was 2.5-fold greater in women (hazard ratio 4.4, 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 6.5) than in men (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 3.1). Our results indicate that AF is a much more pronounced risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular death in women than in men."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Stroke mortality is decreasing in Sweden, as is the case in other Western European countries. However, both decreases and increases have been reported in Sweden for persons younger than age 65 years. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of stroke in Sweden between the periods 1989 and 1991 and 1998 and 2000 in persons aged 30 to 65 years.All first-ever stroke patients aged 30 to 65 years in the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register between 1989 and 2000 were included.The age-standardized, 3-year average incidence increased by 19%, from 98.9 to 118.0 per 100 000 among men, and by 33%, from 48.4 to 64.4 among women, between 1989 and 1991 and 1998 and 2000. The largest increase was seen among those younger than 60 years. On a county level, the change in age-standardized stroke incidence varied from small decreases (-3%) to large increases (82%).Stroke incidence increased in Sweden for both men and women between 1989 and 2000. The increase was larger among women. This calls for action when it comes to studying risk factors and planning for prevention and health promotion and indicates the need for gender-specific studies."Stroke	Management	"Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been shown to be effective in stroke prevention in selected patients. Some studies, however, identified gender as an independent risk factor for perioperative CEA complications demonstrating an increased rate of perioperative stroke or death in women. Furthermore, contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion has been associated with higher rates of perioperative CEA complications. Therefore, we sought to analyse the gender-specific risk of perioperative CEA complications between patients with or without contralateral ICA stenosis or occlusion. We retrospectively analysed 212 consecutive CEA patients (male = 156, Female = 56) for their gender-specific, perioperative risk of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), restenosis and cardiac complications in the presence (62%) or absence (38%) of a contralateral ICA stenosis/occlusion. In women but not in men, risk of perioperative ischemic events (stroke, TIA) or re-stenosis (p = 0.036) and combined perioperative complications (ischemic events, re-stenosis or cardiac complications; 38.2 % vs. 9.1%; p = 0.028) was significantly increased in the presence of a contralateral ICA stenosis or occlusion. Furthermore, in the presence of a contralateral ICA stenosis/occlusion the number of perioperative ischemic events (p = 0.008) and combined perioperative complications (38.2 % vs. 14.3%; p = 0.006) was significantly higher in female than in male patients. Our study suggests that women with contralateral ICA stenosis or occlusion may have a significantly higher risk for perioperative CEA complications than other subgroups of CEA patients. This risk increase seems to be gender-specific and, if confirmed in larger prospective studies, may influence ICA stenosis therapy in the presence of a contralateral ICA stenosis/occlusion in female patients."Stroke	Management	"Early studies showed that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) carried a high risk if performed within days after a large ischemic stroke. Therefore, many surgeons delay CEA for 4 to 6 weeks after any stroke. To determine the effect of delay to CEA on operative risk and benefit, we pooled data from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the European Carotid Surgery Trial.Risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke in the medical group, operative risk of stroke and death, and overall benefit from surgery were determined in relation to the time from the last symptomatic event to randomization. Operative risk of stroke and death was also determined in relation to the time to surgery. Analyses were stratified by sex and type of presenting event.The 30-day perioperative risk of stroke and death was unrelated to the time since the last symptomatic event and was not increased in patients operated <2 weeks after nondisabling stroke. In contrast, the risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke in the medical group fell rapidly with time since event (P<0.001), as did the absolute benefit from surgery (P=0.001). This decline in benefit with time was unrelated to the type of presenting event but was more pronounced in women than men (difference P<0.001). Benefit in women was confined to those randomized <2 weeks after their last event, irrespective of severity of stenosis.CEA can be performed safely within 2 weeks of nondisabling ischemic stroke. Benefit from endarterectomy declines rapidly with increasing delay, particularly in women."Stroke	Outcomes	"The magnitude of disability among elderly stroke survivors is substantial. There have been few community-based estimates of the contribution gender and older age make to stroke-related disability and outcome. Using the original Framingham Study cohort, we documented gender-specific neurological deficits and disability differences in stroke survivors at six months post-stroke. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios, comparing men and women, and adjusting for age, and age and stroke subtype. Age and gender-matched controls were then compared to distinguish stroke-related disability from disability associated with general aging. Results showed that almost half (43%) of all elderly stroke survivors in the cohort had moderate to severe neurological deficits. In the crude analyses, women were more dependent in ADLs (33.9% vs 15.6%), less likely to walk unassisted (40.3% vs 17.8%), and living in nursing homes (34.9 % vs 13.3%). After adjusting for age and stroke subtype, it was older age that accounted for the severity of disability. When compared to age and gender-matched controls, stroke cases were significantly more disabled in all domains studied. In this elderly cohort, more women experienced initial strokes and were more disabled at 6 months post-stroke than men. However, older age at stroke onset, not gender or stroke subtype, was associated with greater disability. Health care providers need to understand that strokes occur later in life for women and that because of age, women are at greater risk for disability and institutionalization."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Previous studies have shown an increased risk of stroke among patients with migraine. However, very few data are available on the possible association between chronic unspecified headache and the risk of stroke.A prospective cohort study including 35,056 randomly selected Finnish men and women aged 25 to 64 years at baseline who participated in a cardiovascular risk factor survey in 1972, 1977, 1982, or 1987. Self-reported headache, smoking, diabetes, blood pressure, weight, height, serum cholesterol level, and oral contraceptive use were recorded at baseline. During the follow-up, 2167 incident stroke events were ascertained with computer-based record linkage.Women reported headache twice as often as men (16.7% vs 8.9%). Among men, the headache-associated hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for stroke were 4.08 (2.10-7.93), 1.86 (1.33-2.59), and 1.24 (1.05-1.47) during 1, 5, and a maximum of 23 years of follow-up, respectively. Adjustment for the other risk factors decreased the hazard ratios only slightly. Among women, there was also a direct but statistically nonsignificant association between headache and the risk of stroke.Chronic headache is an independent predictor of stroke among men. Since the association between headache and the risk of stroke was particularly strong during a short follow-up, chronic headache may be a marker of the underlying disease process leading to acute stroke. The sex difference observed in this association may be due to a higher prevalence and a more heterogeneous etiology of headache in women compared with men."Stroke	Epidemiology	"The information on the existence of sex differences in management of stroke patients is scarce. We evaluated whether sex differences may influence clinical presentation, resource use, and outcome of stroke in a European multicenter study.In a European Concerted Action involving 7 countries, 4499 patients hospitalized for first-in-a-lifetime stroke were evaluated for demographics, risk factors, clinical presentation, resource use, and 3-month survival, disability (Barthel Index), and handicap (Rankin Scale).Overall, 2239 patients were males and 2260 females. Compared with males, female patients were significantly older (mean age 74.5+/-12.5 versus 69.2+/-12.1 years), more frequently institutionalized before stroke, and with a worse prestroke Rankin score (all values P<0.001). History of hypertension (P=0.007) and atrial fibrillation (P<0.001) were significantly more frequent in female stroke patients, as were coma (P<0.001), paralysis (P<0.001), aphasia (P=0.001), swallowing problems (P=0.005), and urinary incontinence (P<0.001) in the acute phase. Brain imaging, Doppler examination, echocardiogram, and angiography were significantly less frequently performed in female than male patients (all values P<0.001). The frequency of carotid surgery was also significantly lower in female patients (P<0.001). At the 3-month follow-up, after controlling for all baseline and clinical variables, female sex was a significant predictor of disability (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.81) and handicap (OR, 1.46; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.86). No significant gender effect was observed on 3-month survival.Sex-specific differences existed in a large European study of hospital admissions for acute stroke. Both medical and sociodemographic factors may significantly influence stroke outcome. Knowledge of these determinants may positively impact quality of care."Stroke	Review	"The existing literature provides conflicting evidence on surgical risks of carotid endarterectomy in women compared with men. We used data from a large population-based carotid surgery registry to determine whether sex differences exist in the risk of perioperative complications from carotid endarterectomy.We analyzed data from the Ontario Carotid Endarterectomy Registry, which contains data on all patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy in the province of Ontario between 1994 and 1997. We compared the risk of death or stroke at 30 days in women and men and used multivariate analyses to adjust for age, comorbid conditions, and surgical factors. Secondary analyses compared the risks of death and/or stroke in women and men at 2 years after surgery.The study sample consisted of 6038 patients (35% women). The risks of perioperative stroke or death were not significantly different in women compared with men (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.35). The combined risk of stroke or death at 2 years after surgery was also similar in women and men (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.21). However, women were more likely to have a stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.51) and less likely to die (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.99) within 2 years after surgery.Perioperative complication rates from carotid endarterectomy are similar in women and men. Women should not be discouraged from carotid endarterectomy solely on the basis of surgical risks."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Using a California-wide hospital discharge database, the authors analyzed all first admissions for stroke in children 1 month through 19 years of age from 1991 through 2000. Incidence rates were estimated as the number of first hospitalizations divided by the person-years at risk; case fatality rates were based on in-hospital deaths.The authors identified 2,278 first admissions for childhood stroke, yielding an annual incidence rate of 2.3 per 100,000 children (1.2 for ischemic stroke, 1.1 for hemorrhagic stroke). Compared with whites, black children were at higher risk of stroke (for ischemic stroke, relative risk [RR] 2.59, 95% CI 2.17 to 3.09, p < 0.0001; subarachnoid hemorrhage [SAH], RR 1.59, CI 1.06 to 2.33, p = 0.02; intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH], RR 1.66, CI 1.23 to 2.13, p = 0.0001). Hispanics, however, had a lower risk of ischemic stroke (RR 0.70, CI 0.60 to 0.82, p < 0.0001) and ICH (RR 0.77, CI 0.64 to 0.93, p = 0.0004), whereas Asians had similar risks as whites. Boys were at higher risk for all stroke types than girls (ischemic stroke, RR 1.25, CI 1.11 to 1.40, p = 0.0002; SAH, RR 1.24, CI 1.00 to 1.53, p = 0.047; ICH, RR 1.34, CI 1.16 to 1.56, p = 0.0001). After eliminating cases with coexisting sickle cell disease, excess stroke risk persisted in blacks; after elimination of trauma, excess stroke risk persisted in boys. Case fatality rates were similar among different ethnic groups. Compared with girls, boys had a higher case fatality rate for ischemic stroke (17 vs 12%; p = 0.002) but not for ICH or SAH.Rates of hospitalization for stroke are higher among black children and boys; sickle cell disease and trauma do not fully account for these findings."Stroke	Epidemiology	"There are few studies analyzing stroke in women, taking into account the vascular risk factors, cause of stroke, clinical picture, and outcome. The purpose of this study was to analyze possible sex differences in patients suffering first-ever acute stroke.From December 1995 to January 2002, 1581 patients with first-ever acute stroke were analyzed, taking into account sex, age, risk factors, clinical presentation, stroke subtype, treatment, and outcome data.Mean age was higher in women than in men (P<0.001). Hypertension (P=0.0027) and cardioembolic disease (P=0.0035) were independent factors related to women. Alcohol overuse (P<0.001), smoking (P<0.001), and vascular peripheral disease (P=0.031) were related to the male sex. Women more often suffered aphasic disorders (P<0.001), visual field disturbances (P<0.05), and dysphagia (P<0.01) than men. There were no differences in hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes according to sex. Women suffered more cardioembolic strokes (P<0.001); men suffered more atherothrombotic (P<0.001) and lacunar strokes (P<0.05). Women who survived remained more disabled than men (P<0.001).Sex determines some clear differences in patients suffering a first-ever stroke. Women were, on average, 6 years older than men and had a different profile of vascular risk factors and a different distribution of stroke subtypes. Women had a longer hospital stay and remained more disabled than men. The amelioration of hypertension control and increase in anticoagulant treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation would be the best options for preventing stroke, especially in women."Stroke	Outcomes	"It is disputed whether there are sex differences in management and outcome after stroke; early studies have shown inconsistent results. The objective of this study was to verify and explain differences between men and women in management and outcome after stroke in a national perspective.In 2001, 20 761 stroke patients were registered in Riks-Stroke, the national quality register for stroke care in Sweden in which all 84 hospitals participate. Data from 9 hospitals that had reported <70% of the estimated stroke events were excluded from analyses, leaving 19 547 patients (9666 women, 9881 men) at 75 hospitals for the present analyses.Women were older than men (77.8 versus 73.2 years). After age adjustment, female patients were more often disabled, living at home with community support, or in institutions before the stroke. They also had a different cardiovascular risk factor profile. Case fatality ratios during the first 3 months were similar in men and women. After 3 months, more women were physically and mentally impaired and dependent on other persons. Female patients with atrial fibrillation received oral anticoagulants less often than men. Even after multiple adjustments for differences between sexes, female sex was independently associated with institutional living 3 months after the stroke (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.4).Women have a worse prestroke condition. Except for case fatality ratios, they also have a worse outcome after stroke after adjustment for other prognostic factors. There are also sex differences in the medical management of stroke that need to be rectified."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Women are at higher risk for stroke after cardiac surgery than men. Prior analysis of risk profiles for perioperative stroke that have mostly combined data from women and men may fail to identify gender-specific risks. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patient gender impacts adjusted risk for stroke after cardiac surgery.Demographic and perioperative data were prospectively collected from 2,972 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Carotid artery ultrasound examination was performed before surgery for patients aged 65 yr or older or when there was a history of transient ischemic attacks or prior stroke. Epiaortic ultrasound was performed at the time of surgery in all patients to assess for atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta.Strokes occurred after surgery in 30 women and 18 men (P < 0.0001). Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, a history of a stroke was the strongest predictor of new stroke for both women and men. Low cardiac output syndrome, atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta, and diabetes mellitus were significantly associated with stroke for women but not for men. Analysis on the data from all patients using a gender-interaction term found that the risk for stroke associated with patient age, atherosclerosis of the aorta, diabetes, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was not affected by gender. The prior stroke-gender interaction, however, was significant (P = 0.017), suggesting that a prior cerebrovascular event was a more important predictor of stroke for men than women.These data show that prior stroke before surgery is strongly and independently associated with susceptibility for stroke after cardiac surgery, particularly for men. Other risk factors for perioperative stroke, though, do not appear to be influenced by patient gender."Stroke	Management	"BMS-204352 is a novel maxi-K channel opener that is being developed for the treatment for stroke. The current study was designed to evaluate the dose proportionality and pharmacokinetics of BMS-204352 in rats. In an open, parallel fashion, sixteen rats per gender received a single intraarterial dose of BMS-204352 as a 3-min infusion into the carotid artery at 0.4, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg dose levels. Serial blood samples were collected for up to 24 h post-dose and plasma samples were analyzed for the concentrations of intact BMS-204352 using a validated liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric (LC/MS) method. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a non-compartmental method. Results revealed a gender difference in the pharmacokinetics of BMS-204352 in rats at all doses excluding the first (i.e., 0.4 mg/kg) dose panel. BMS-204352 peak plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values increased in a proportion greater than the increment in dose. Specifically, as dose increased in the ratio 1:5:12.5:25, C(max) increased in the ratio 1:7:18:31 in male rats and 1:7:22:51 in female rats. The respective AUC ratios were 1:6:20:42 in male rats and 1:12:29:77 in female rats. Mean total body clearance (CL(T)) values for BMS-204352 ranged from 879-3242 ml/h/kg over the four dose levels and generally decreased with increase in dose. Similarly, steady state volume of distribution (V(SS)) values ranged from 3621-8933 ml/kg over the four dose levels and generally decreased with increase in dose. However, mean residence time (MRT) and elimination half-life (T(1/2)) values for BMS-204352 were independent of dose and ranged from 2.42-4.54 to 2.08-4.70 h, respectively. In conclusion, BMS-204352 appears to exhibit dose-dependent pharmacokinetics in rats. In addition, there appeared to be some evidence of gender related differences in the pharmacokinetics of BMS-204352."Stroke	Clinical	"We determine whether a sex difference exists for acute stroke emergency department presentation.The TLL Temple Foundation Stroke Project is a prospective observational study of acute stroke management that identified 1,189 validated strokes in nonurban community EDs from February 1998 to March 2000. Structured interview of the patient and the person with the patient at symptom onset identified the symptom or symptoms that prompted the patient to seek medical attention. Interview data were available for 1,124 (94%) patients. A physician blinded to sex classified the reported symptoms into 14 categories.Nontraditional stroke symptoms were reported by 28% of women and 19% of men (odds ratio 1.62; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.2). Nontraditional stroke symptoms, pain (men 8%, women 12%) and change in level of consciousness (men 12%, women 17%), were more often reported by women. Traditional stroke symptoms, imbalance (men 20%, women 15%) and hemiparesis (men 24%, women 19%), were reported more frequently by men. Trends were also found for women to present with nonneurologic symptoms (men 17%, women 21%) and men to present with gait abnormalities (men 11%, women 8%). There was no sex difference in the mean number of symptoms reported by an individual patient.This study suggests that a sex difference exists in reporting of acute stroke symptoms. Women with validated strokes present more frequently with nontraditional stroke symptoms than men. Recognition of this difference might yield faster evaluation and management of female patients with acute stroke eligible for acute therapies."Stroke	Epidemiology	"To investigate gender-related differences in the characteristics and mortality of stroke patients admitted to the hospital.Prospective study of 296 consecutive patients admitted with a stroke and studied for epidemiologic features, risk factors, prior morbidity, neurologic details, acute-phase characteristics, acute mortality, and 90-day mortality. Patients were divided into male and female groups for analysis.Male-to-female ratio was 163 (55%) males to 133 (45%) females. There were no differences in mean age (P = .10), risk factors, stroke syndromes, infarct size, acute-phase characteristics, or complications. Females were found to be less frequently on prior aspirin (P = .02) and had fewer lacunar strokes (P = .005). A trend was observed for higher acute-phase mortality in females (P = .065); mortality at 90 days was similar (P = .71).There are no gender-related differences in patients admitted with acute strokes. A minor trend for higher acute-phase mortality in females may be due to their less frequent lacunar strokes and less frequent use of aspirin prior to stroke. Men and women with acute strokes should have access to similar services."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Ischemic stroke accounts for 70% to 80% of all strokes, but intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhagic strokes have greater fatality. Age-standardized death rates from overall stroke are higher among men than women, but little is known about sex differences in stroke subtype mortality by race/ethnicity.We analyzed 1995 to 1998 national death certificate data to compare sex-specific age-standardized death rates (per 100 000) for ischemic stroke (n=507 256), intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke (n=98 709), and subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke (n=27 334) among whites, blacks, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics. We calculated rate ratios and 95% CIs comparing women with men within age and racial/ethnic groups.Age-specific rates of ischemic and intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke deaths were lower for women than for men aged 25 to 44 and 45 to 64 years but were higher for ischemic stroke among older women, aged > or =65 years. Only among whites did women have higher age-standardized rates of ischemic stroke. Age-standardized death rates for intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke among women were lower than or similar to those among men in all racial/ethnic groups. Women had higher risk of death from subarachnoid hemorrhagic; this sex differential increased with age.The female-to-male mortality ratio differs for stroke subtypes by race/ethnicity and age. A primary public health effort should focus on increasing the awareness of stroke symptoms, particularly among people at high risk, to decrease delay in early detection and effective stroke treatment."Stroke	Review	"This article reviews genetic studies of stroke, bearing insight into human evidence by using studies on twins as well as on monogenic forms of stroke. Focus will be given to inbred animal models that have been used to improve genetic homogeneity and to control environmental influences. Such animal studies have lead to the identification of quantitative trait loci harboring putative genes for stroke susceptibility and sensitivity. The major strategies for gene identification are discussed. Experimental animal models of stroke have also revealed a sexual dimorphism in stroke susceptibility and sensitivity and this article reviews 2 possible candidates, namely, the Y chromosome and estrogens."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Increasing evidence has demonstrated striking sex differences in the outcome of neurological injury. Whereas estrogens contribute to these differences by attenuating neurotoxicity and ischemia-reperfusion injury, the effects of testosterone are unclear. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of testosterone on neuronal injury in both a cell-culture model and a rodent ischemia-reperfusion model. Glutamate-induced HT-22 cell-death model was used to evaluate the effects of testosterone on cell survival. Testosterone was shown to significantly increase the toxicity of glutamate at a 10 microM concentration, whereas 17beta-estradiol significantly attenuated the toxicity at the same concentration. In a rodent stroke model, ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced by temporal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h and reperfusion for 24 h. To avoid the stress-related testosterone reduction, male rats were castrated and testosterone was replaced by testosterone pellet implantation. Testosterone pellets were removed at 1, 2, 4, or 6 h before MCAO to determine the duration of acute testosterone depletion effects on infarct volume. Ischemic lesion volume was significantly decreased from 239.6 +/- 25.9 mm(3) in control to 122.5 +/- 28.6 mm(3) when testosterone pellets were removed at 6 h before MCAO. Reduction of lesion volume was associated with amelioration of the hyperemia during reperfusion. Our in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that sex differences in response to brain injury are partly due to the consequence of damaging effects of testosterone."Stroke	Epidemiology	"If sex differences in stroke risk factor profiles exist among African Americans in the United States, prevention strategies will need to reflect those differences. African Americans and women have been underrepresented in stroke prevention studies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether medical and lifestyle factors differ among women and men who have enrolled in the African-American Antiplatelet Stroke Prevention Study (AAASPS).We performed a planned exploratory analysis of differences in baseline characteristics and risk factors between women and men enrolled in AAASPS, a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, controlled trial. Frequencies of vascular risk factors and related conditions, medical therapies, stroke subtypes, and vascular territories were compared between women and men by 1-way ANOVA and Fisher's exact test where appropriate.A total of 1087 African American patients (574 women, 513 men) enrolled between December 1995 and June 1999. Women had higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, family history of stroke, and no reported leisure exercise. Men had higher rates of smoking and heavy alcohol use. Few differences were noted in proportions of stroke subtype or proportions receiving preventive therapy.AAASPS represents the largest enrollment of African American women in a recurrent stroke prevention study. Our data suggest that African American women in a clinical trial differ from men in the frequency of key vascular risk factors. Although limited, these data provide an important first characterization of sex differences in African Americans with stroke."Stroke	Management	"Post hoc analysis results of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study suggest that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) may not be as efficacious in women as it is in men. This study was undertaken for the evaluation of whether there is a difference between men and women in early postoperative outcome after CEA and whether such a difference is consistent across other predictors.We conducted a retrospective review of all CEAs entered into our departmental registry between January 1, 1989, and November 30, 2000. A total of 3422 CEAs was performed in 3077 consecutive patients. The ratio of men to women was 2:1, and the ratio of patients who were asymptomatic to patients who were symptomatic was 2.3:1. The following in-hospital outcome data were analyzed: transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, mortality, combined TIA or stroke, and combined stroke or mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis results of selected risk factors for an adverse perioperative event were assessed with generalized estimating equation analysis with backwards selection. The following risk factors were considered: gender, preoperative neurologic status, urgency of operation, type of arteriotomy repair, reoperative CEA for recurrent stenosis, history of cardiopulmonary disease, previous coronary artery intervention, simultaneous CEA and coronary bypass grafting surgery, renal failure, and diabetes.Univariate analysis results of gender differences revealed that women were at higher risk for a postoperative TIA or stroke (3.3% for women versus 2.1% for men; odds ratio [OR], 1.6; confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 2.5; P =.03) and for postoperative stroke or mortality (3.1% for women versus 2.1% for men; OR, 1.6; CI, 1.04 to 2.5; P =.03). Multivariate analysis results showed that female gender was an independent predictor for a postoperative TIA or stroke (OR, 1.7; CI, 1.1 to 2.6; P =.03). Further analysis disclosed that women who were asymptomatic were at greater risk than were men for postoperative stroke or mortality (OR, 2.3; CI, 1.3 to 3.9; P =.003). Conversely, there was no gender association for postoperative stroke or mortality in the consideration of only patients who were symptomatic (OR, 1.0; CI, 0.45 to 2.1; P =.95). The interaction between women and preoperative symptoms approached significance (P =.07) with respect to postoperative stroke and mortality rate, which suggests that the gender effect could be influenced by the clinical presentation.The combined TIA or stroke and stroke or mortality rates are higher in women as compared with men in the postoperative period, but these risks remain acceptable when CEA is performed for appropriate indications. The interaction between symptoms and gender suggests that, in patients who are asymptomatic, women are more likely than are men to have early complications. However, there is no gender difference in patients who are symptomatic. Therefore, despite a low postoperative complication rate, CEA is appropriate in both women who are asymptomatic and women who are symptomatic only if the postoperative TIA, stroke, and mortality rates are appreciably lower than in the natural history of medical management of these patients."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"To investigate gender differences in conventional, coagulation and fibrinolytic factors in South Asian ischaemic stroke patients, we compared these variables in 50 South Asian females (SAFP) with 90 South Asian males (SAMP) with ischaemic stroke and in 52 females (SAFC) and 38 males (SAMC) without stroke. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen levels were significantly higher in SAFP compared with SAMP (18.2 vs. 13.3 U/ml, P = 0.04) even after adjustment for known covariates, but there was no difference in PAI-1 antigen levels between males and females in the control group. South Asian females exhibited higher levels of factor VII antigen and FVII:C activity in both stroke patients (114 vs. 99% in males, P = 0.01; 116 versus 104% in males, P = 0.04) and controls (116 vs. 97% in males, P = 0.004; 115 vs. 93% in males, P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the levels of fibrinogen (3.8 vs. 3.7 g/l), FXIIa (2.2 vs. 2.4 ng/ml), von Willebrand factor (1.8 vs. 1.9 IU/ml) and tissue plasminogen activator (11.4 vs. 12.0 ng/ml) in SAMP and SAFP respectively. These results suggest that South Asian females have increased FVII levels and that females with a history of ischaemic stroke have a decreased fibrinolytic potential in comparison with males."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"1. In the present study, we examined the effect of resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene), a phytoestrogen found in the skins of most grapes, on oxidative DNA damage in male and female stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). 2. Five-week-old male and female SHRSP were divided into control and resveratrol groups. The resveratrol group was given 1 mg/kg per day, orally, resveratrol by gastric intubation once a day. 3. Following an 8 week feeding period, the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), produced from deoxyguanosine under conditions of oxidative stress, in the urine of male and female resveratrol-treated SHRSP were significantly lower than that in control SHRSP. 4. The urine of resveratrol-treated male and female SHRSP had lower levels of hydroperoxide compared with control SHRSP, but the difference was not significant. 5. Treatment with resveratrol resulted in a 25 and 30% reduction in plasma glycated albumin in male and female SHRSP, respectively, compared with controls. 6. Gender differences for SHRSP with regard to 8-OHdG, hydroperoxide and glycated albumin levels were not confirmed, resveratrol having similar protective effects on male and female SHRSP. 7. These results indicate that dietary resveratrol: (i) plays a role in suppressing oxidative DNA damage and glycoxidative stress in vivo; and (ii) has similar protective effects in both male and female SHRSP, suggesting that the direct effects of this phytoestrogen on oxidative stress in vivo are not sexually dimorphic."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Moderately elevated plasma homocysteine levels have been established as independent risk factors in vascular disease, including ischemic stroke. Recently, a common mutation (C677T) in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene reducing the activity of MTHFR and increasing homocysteine levels in plasma was reported. The C677T MTHFR mutation may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke, but the results of previous studies have been conflicting. One possible explanation is that the association with the MTHFR genotype may be different according to gender. To investigate the association for ischemic stroke, we conducted a case-control study of 77 hospital cases (49 men and 28 women) with ischemic stroke and 229 (120 men and 109 women) control subjects in Japanese. The prevalence of conventional vascular risk factors and MTHFR genotypes were determined in case and controls. After adjustment by multiple analysis in all there was no statistical significance in MTHFR genotypes. The conventional vascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 17.21), hypertension (adjusted OR, 4.67), smoking habit (adjusted OR, 4.70), and hyperlipidemia (adjusted OR, 2.73) were identified independently associated with ischemic stroke. With a separate sex analysis it was identified that the relationship of the MTHFR T/T gneotype was statisticaly significant in women (adjusted OR, 9.49; 95% CI, 1.75-51.47, P=0.0091). The relevance of the MTHFR T/T mutation appears to be restricted to women, suggesting a role of female hormones in the resistance to elevated homocysteine levels due to the MTHFR T/T mutation."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Estrogens account for gender differences in the incidence and outcome of stroke, but it remains unclear to what extent neuroprotective effects of estrogens are because of parenchymal or vascular actions. Because reproductive steroids have vasoactive properties, the authors assessed the effects and mechanisms of action of 17-beta-estradiol in rabbit isolated basilar artery. Cumulative doses of 17-beta-estradiol (0.3 micromol/L to 0.1 mmol/L) induced concentration-dependent relaxation that was larger in basilar than carotid artery, in male than female basilar artery, and in KCl-precontracted than UTP-precontracted male basilar artery. Endothelium removal did not modify relaxation induced by 17-beta-estradiol in basilar artery, whereas relaxation induced by acetylcholine (1 nmol/L to 0.1 mmol/L) was almost abolished. Neither the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 (1 micromol/L), nor the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (1 micromol/L) affected 17-beta-estradiol-induced relaxations. Relaxations induced by the K(+) channel openers NS1619 and pinacidil in the same concentration range were greater and lower, respectively, when compared with relaxation to 17-beta-estradiol, which was not significantly modified by incubation with the K(+) channel blockers charybdotoxin (1 nmol/L and 0.1 micromol/L) or glibenclamide (10 nmol/L and 1 micromol/L). Preincubation with 17-beta-estradiol (3 to 100 micromol/L) produced concentration-dependent inhibition of CaCl(2)-induced contraction, with less potency than the Ca(2+) entry blocker nicardipine (0.01 to 10 nmol/L). The authors conclude that 17-beta-estradiol induces endothelium-independent relaxation of cerebral arteries with tissue and gender selectivity. The relaxant effect is because of inhibition of extracellular Ca(2+) influx to vascular smooth muscle, but activation of estrogen receptors, protein synthesis, or K(+) efflux are not involved. Relatively high pharmacologic concentrations of 17-beta-estradiol causing relaxation preclude acute vascular effects of physiologic circulating levels on the cerebral circulation."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"The role of gender difference and estrogen in ischemic cerebrovascular events is controversial. Evidence is lacking as to whether or not there are significant gender differences in the incidence and outcome of stroke in the clinical setting. Recent clinical epidemiological studies have demonstrated that there is no significant association between the use of hormonal replacement therapy and the risk of stroke. However, several animal studies have shown that there are gender differences in stroke outcome and that exogenous administered estrogens are neuroprotective. In this study, the influence of gender differences and the effects of synthetic and non-synthetic estrogens were examined in a model of focal cerebral ischemia using 210 male, intact female, and ovariectomized female rats. All animals underwent 3 h of middle cerebral artery and bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. After 72 h, the rats were sacrificed and stained for histological assessment of infarction. There were no gender differences in infarction volume. Intravenous administration of either low or high dose 17 beta-estradiol or tibolone did not alter infarct volume. Subcutaneous administration of low and high dose 17beta-estradiol using 7-day release pellets did not alter infarct volume. Low dose tibolone using implanted 7-day release pellets did not alter infarct volume. However, high dose tibolone using implanted 7-day release pellets significantly (P<0.05) reduced infarct volume only in ovariectomized female rats. These results demonstrate that estrogen therapy has no effect on infarction volume following severe focal cerebral ischemia."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Incidence of stroke differs between men and women and it increases nearly exponentially with age. Therefore, assessment of family history of stroke disregarding sex and age of family members results in bias or misclassification. In this study the effects of sex and age on the positivity of the past history were analyzed numerically. Sex- and age-specific proportion of a positive history of stroke among 24,007 family members was obtained from a questionnaire survey of 2,316 high school students. By analyzing the sex- and age-specific proportion with the logistic regression model odds ratios resulting from sex and age difference were estimated. The odds ratio for sex difference was 2.458 (95% confidence interval: 2.067-2.924) and odds ratio for age difference was 1.064 (95% confidence interval: 1.058-1.070). This indicated that a positive history of stroke was 2.458 times higher in male members than in female members of the same age and that a positive history increased by (1.064)y, where y was age difference in years. Potential bias or misclassification resulting from disregarding sex and age can be substantial. Some measures to control for sex and age of family members are required in assessing the family history."Stroke	Management	"Atherosclerotic plaque of the proximal portion of the aorta is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in the elderly. Different cutoffs of plaque thickness have been used in the literature for risk stratification and have been applied to both men and women. However, the assumption that the relationship between plaque thickness and stroke risk is the same in the 2 genders has not been proven. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the prevalence of different degrees of aortic plaque thickness differed in men and women with ischemic stroke.We performed transesophageal echocardiography in 152 patients aged >59 years with acute ischemic stroke (76 men and 76 women) and in 152 control subjects of similar age (70 men and 82 women). Odds ratios (ORs) for ischemic stroke with 95% CIs for different plaque thickness definitions were calculated for the overall group and separately for men and women by logistic regression analysis after adjusting for age, arterial hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.Aortic plaques >/=4 mm were significantly more frequent in men than in women (31.5% versus 20.3%, respectively; P:=0.025) and were associated with ischemic stroke in both men (adjusted OR 6.0, CI 2.1 to 16.8) and women (adjusted OR 3. 2, CI 1.2 to 8.8). However, plaques 3 to 3.9 mm in thickness had a significant association with stroke in women (adjusted OR 4.8, CI 1. 7 to 15.0) but not in men (adjusted OR 0.8, CI 0.2 to 3.0). Plaques <3 mm were not associated with a significantly increased stroke risk for either sex.Smaller aortic plaques are significantly associated with ischemic stroke in women but not in men. If the increased prevalence of smaller plaques in women is confirmed to be associated with increased risk for embolic stroke, different cutoff points may have to be adopted in men and women for risk stratification and for decisions regarding medical intervention."Stroke	Epidemiology	"We estimated the incidence of first-ever cerebral infarction in regard to its subtypes and analyzed their risk factors separately in a community-based prospective cohort study in Japan.Stroke-free subjects (n=1621) aged >/=40 years were followed up for 32 years from 1961. During this period, 298 cerebral infarctions occurred and were divided into 167 lacunar, 62 atherothrombotic, 56 cardioembolic, and 13 undetermined subtypes of infarction on the basis of clinical information including brain imaging and autopsy findings.The age-adjusted incidence of lacunar infarction (3.8 per 1000 person-years for men and 2.0 for women) was higher than that of atherothrombotic infarction (1.2, 0. 7) and cardioembolic infarction (1.3, 0.5) in both sexes. Time-dependent Cox's proportional hazard analysis revealed systolic blood pressure as well as age to be independent risk factors for all subtypes of cerebral infarction except for cardioembolic infarction in men. Additionally, ST depression on ECG, glucose intolerance, and smoking in men and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG and body mass index in women remained significant risk factors for lacunar infarction. ST depression was also significantly related to events of atherothrombotic infarction in women. The risk of atrial fibrillation for cardioembolic infarction was outstandingly high in both sexes, and left ventricular hypertrophy and lower total cholesterol were additional risk factors for cardioembolic infarction in women.In this Japanese population, lacunar infarction was the most common subtype of cerebral infarction and had a greater variety of risk factors, including not only hypertension but also ECG abnormalities, diabetes, obesity, and smoking, than did atherothrombotic infarction or cardioembolic infarction."Stroke	Review	"Increasing evidence has demonstrated striking sex differences in the pathophysiology of and outcome after acute neurological injury. Lesser susceptibility to postischemic and posttraumatic brain injury in females has been observed in experimental models. Additional evidence suggests this sex difference extends to humans as well. The greater neuroprotection afforded to females is likely due to the effects of circulating estrogens and progestins. In fact, exogenous administration of both hormones has been shown to improve outcome after cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury in experimental models. The neuroprotection provided by periinjury administration of these hormones extends to males as well. The mechanisms by which estrogen and progesterone provide such neuroprotection are likely multifactorial, and probably depend on the type and severity of injury as well as the type and concentration of hormone present. Both genomic and nongenomic mechanisms may be involved. Estrogen's putative effects include preservation of autoregulatory function, an antioxidant effect, reduction of A beta production and neurotoxicity, reduced excitotoxicity, increased expression of the antiapoptotic factor bcl-2, and activation of mitogen activated protein kinase pathways. It is hypothesized that several of these neuroprotective mechanisms can be linked back to estrogen's ability to act as a potent chemical (i.e., electron-donating) antioxidant. Progesterone, on the other hand, has a membrane stabilizing effect that also serves to reduce the damage caused by lipid peroxidation. In addition, it may also provide neuroprotection by suppressing neuronal hyperexcitability. The following review will discuss experimental and clinical evidence for sex differences in outcome after acute brain trauma and stroke, review the evidence implicating estrogens and progestins as mediators of this neuroprotection following acute neurological injury, and finally, address the specific mechanisms by which these hormones may protect the brain following acute neurological injury."Stroke	Management	"Previous studies have shown that women receive fewer invasive procedures for the treatment of coronary artery disease than men, but gender differences in cerebrovascular disease have not been well studied. Our objective was to explore differences in the treatment of stroke between men and women.Secondary database analyses.We examined the use of carotid endarterectomy in a nationally representative sample of Medicare enrollees aged 65 to 84, hospitalized for a principal diagnosis of stroke in 1992, the ""all strokes group"". We also studied a subgroup of patients, the ""carotid disease subgroup"", admitted with a principal diagnosis of precerebral arterial occlusion and stenosis or transient cerebral ischemia.We determined rates of carotid endarterectomy for the all strokes group within gender and age groups and calculated corresponding female-to-male relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We also performed similar analyses for the carotid disease subgroup. We then used logistic regression to estimate the relative risk of use of carotid endarterectomy for women, controlling for age and comorbidity.The all-strokes group consisted of 3,356 women and 2,927 men, of whom 1,009 women and 990 men were in the carotid disease subgroup. The overall age-adjusted female-to-male relative risk of undergoing carotid endarterectomy for those aged 65 to 84 was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.64-0.74) in the all strokes group and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.72-0.82) in the carotid disease subgroup. In both analyses, the RR became more pronounced with increasing age. In the all strokes group, for example, the RR was 0.80 (0.70-0.92) for those aged 65 to 69 and 0.39 (0.32-0.48) for those aged 80 to 84. The RR for the all strokes group remained similar in magnitude even after controlling for comorbidity (RR, 0.63 and 95% CI, 0.59-0.70).We conclude that women hospitalized for strokes undergo fewer carotid endarterectomies than men. Further studies are needed to examine the reasons for and implications of this gender difference."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Young adult female rats sustain smaller infarcts after experimental stroke than age-matched males. This sex difference in ischemic brain injury in young animals disappears after surgical ovariectomy and can be restored by estrogen replacement. We sought to determine whether ischemic brain injury continues to be smaller in middle-aged, reproductively senescent female rats compared with age-matched males and to test the effect of ovarian steroids on brain injury after experimental stroke in females.Four groups of 16-month old Wistar rats (males [n=9], untreated females [n=9], and females pretreated with 17beta-estradiol [25-microgram pellets administered subcutaneously for 7 days; n=9] or progesterone [10-mg pellets administered subcutaneously for 7 days; n=9] were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion with the intraluminal filament technique, followed by 22 hours of reperfusion. Physiological variables and laser-Doppler cerebral cortical perfusion were monitored throughout ischemia and early reperfusion. In a separate cohort of males (n=3), untreated females (n=3), females pretreated with 17beta-estradiol (n=3), and females pretreated with progesterone (n=3), end-ischemic regional cerebral blood flow was measured by [(14)C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography.As predicted, infarct size was not different between middle-aged male and female rats. Cortical infarcts were 21+/-5% and 31+/-6% of ipsilateral cerebral cortex, and striatal infarcts were 44+/-7% and 43+/-5% of ipsilateral striatum in males and females, respectively. Both estrogen and progesterone reduced cortical infarct in reproductively senescent females (5+/-2% and 16+/-4% in estrogen- and progesterone-treated groups, respectively, compared with 31+/-6% in untreated group). Striatal infarct was smaller in the estrogen- but not in the progesterone-treated group. Relative change in laser-Doppler cerebral cortical perfusion from preischemic baseline and absolute end-ischemic regional cerebral blood flow were not affected by hormonal treatments.We conclude that the protection against ischemic brain injury found in young adult female rats disappears after reproductive senescence in middle-aged females and that ovarian hormones alleviate stroke injury in reproductively senescent female rats by a blood flow-independent mechanism. These findings support a role for hormone replacement therapy in stroke injury prevention in postmenopausal women."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"While a number of laboratories have begun to examine gender differences in outcome following experimental stroke, little is known about the relative response of male and female brains to traumatic injury. In the following series of experiments, we used the Marmarou impact-acceleration head injury model (with a 500-g, 1.5-m weight drop) to compare the pathophysiological responses of male and female rats to closed-head injury. Cortical blood flow (CBF; laser-doppler flowmetry), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), blood gas levels, blood pH, and body temperature were measured preinjury and at regular intervals postinjury. Acute survival was assessed 1 h after injury. The role of estrogen in the observed gender differences was assessed by examining these physiological measures after injury in ovariectomized females, with or without 17beta-estradiol replacement, and in intact males, with or without exogenous 17beta-estradiol administration. In the first experiment, significantly more females (100%) survived the acute injury period (60 min) after injury than did males (72%). Survival appeared related to the magnitude and persistence of the posttraumatic drop in MAP. In a second experiment, females showed a less dramatic reduction in and better recovery of CBF than males. The gender difference in CBF was paralleled to some degree by differences in the pattern of MAP changes after injury. Differences in body weight, blood gas levels, or blood pH did not account for the gender difference in CBF. Postinjury CBF was higher in female and male rats given 2 weeks of daily 17beta-estradiol injections prior to injury compared to those given the vehicle only. However, 17beta-estradiol administration did not alter MAP, suggesting that the gender difference in CBF was not strictly due to MAP changes. Our findings suggest that estrogen plays a role in maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion in the acute period following closed-head injury. This protective mechanism may underlie the gender difference in acute survival observed in this study, and may help explain observations of better outcome in females than in males after brain injury. We conclude that CBF preservation is one mechanism by which estrogen is neuroprotective following traumatic brain injury. We hypothesize, based upon known effects of estrogen, that the beneficial microvascular effects of estrogen most likely involve a combination of endothelial nitric oxide synthase induction and an antioxidant effect."Stroke	Management	"Previous studies have documented sex differences in the management and outcome of patients with cardiovascular disease. However, little data exist on whether similar sex differences exist in stroke patients. We conducted a study to determine whether sex differences exist in patients with acute stroke admitted to Ontario hospitals.Using linked administrative databases, we performed a population-based cohort study. The databases contained information on all 44 832 patients discharged from acute-care hospitals in Ontario between April 1993 and March 1996 with a most responsible diagnosis of acute stroke. The main outcomes measured consisted of sex differences in comorbidities, the use of rehabilitative services, the use of antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulants (in elderly stroke survivors aged > or =65 years only), discharge destination, and mortality.Male stroke patients were more likely than female stroke patients to have a history of ischemic heart disease (18.1% versus 15.3%, respectively; P<0.001) and diabetes mellitus (20.1% versus 18. 7%, respectively; P<0.001), whereas female patients were more likely than male patients to have hypertension (33.8% versus 30.0%, respectively; P<0.001) and atrial fibrillation (12.9% versus 10.2%, respectively; P<0.001). There were no sex differences in the usage of in-hospital rehabilitative services. The overall 90-day postdischarge use of aspirin and ticlopidine was similar in stroke survivors aged 65 to 84 years. However, among stroke survivors aged > or =85 years, men were more likely than women to receive aspirin (36. 0% versus 30.7%, respectively; P<0.001) and ticlopidine (9.2% versus 6.8%, respectively; P=0.007). Use of warfarin was similar for the two sexes. Men were more likely than women to be discharged home (50. 6% versus 40.9%, respectively; P<0.001) and less likely to be discharged to chronic care facilities (16.8% versus 25.2%, respectively; P<0.001). The risk of death 1 year after stroke was somewhat lower in women than men (adjusted odds ratio 0.939, 95% CI 0.899 to 0.980; P=0.004). The mortality differences were greatest among elderly stroke patients.Elderly men are more likely than elderly women to receive aspirin and ticlopidine and equally like to receive warfarin after a stroke. Despite these differences, elderly women have a better 1-year survival after a stroke."Stroke	Outcomes	"To establish prevalence of urinary symptoms among community-dwelling stroke survivors and how these symptoms affected lives of these survivors compared with a nonstroke population.The present study was a community-based postal survey in Leicestershire community, UK (that excluded institutional settings), that was designed to track stroke, urinary, and bowel symptoms and the effect of such symptoms on relationships, social life, daily activities, and overall quality of life. Subjects included 14 600 people who were living in the community and </=40 years of age, randomly selected from the Leicestershire Health Authority Register.A 70% response rate was achieved with the return of 10 226 questionnaires. Prevalence of reported stroke was 4% (n=423). Prevalence of urinary symptoms was 34% (n=3197). Overall, stroke survivors had a higher prevalence of symptoms than the nonstroke population (64% to 32%, respectively). These symptoms were reported to have more of an effect on the lives of the stroke survivors compared with the nonstroke population even when adjusted for age and sex differences. This reported impact was not related to the stroke per se but to the severity of the urinary symptoms.These data show a high prevalence of urinary symptoms among community-dwelling stroke survivors. These symptoms were reported to have considerable impact on the lives of stroke survivors, which needs to be taken into account in future research and clinical practice."Stroke	Review	"Recent evidence suggests that reproductive steroids are important players in shaping stroke outcome and cerebrovascular pathophysiologic features. Although women are at lower risk for stroke than men, this native protection is lost in the postmenopausal years. Therefore, aging women sustain a large burden for stroke, contrary to a popular misconception that cancer is the main killer of women. Further, the value of hormone replacement therapy in stroke prevention or in improving outcome remains controversial. Estrogen has been the best studied of the sex steroids in both laboratory and clinical settings and is considered increasingly to be an endogenous neuroprotective agent. A growing number of studies demonstrate that exogenous estradiol reduces tissue damage resulting from experimental ischemic stroke in both sexes. This new concept suggests that dissecting interactions between estrogen and cerebral ischemia will yield novel insights into generalized cellular mechanisms of injury. Less is known about estrogen's undesirable effects in brain, for example, the potential for increasing seizure susceptibility and migraine. This review summarizes gender-specific aspects of clinical and experimental stroke and results of estrogen treatment on outcome in animal models of cerebral ischemia, and briefly discusses potential vascular and parenchymal mechanisms by which estrogen salvages brain."Stroke	Review	"The literature regarding gender-specific aspects of cerebrovascular diseases is quite sparse. It is well-documented that the incidence of stroke is higher in men than in women in all age classes, and women are, on average, several years older than men when they suffer their first stroke. The prevalence of stroke is higher among men up to the age of approximately 80 years, after which it becomes higher in women. A majority of studies indicate that the case-fatality rate is higher in female than in male stroke patients; there is also some evidence, albeit relatively weak, indicating a better functional outcome in men. Gender differences in risk factor profile and treatment response appear to be weak. The burden of providing informal care to stroke patients seems to constitute a threat to the mental health of the caregivers, who are predominantly women."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), whether sporadic or familial (FALS), is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disorder involving the motor neurons of the cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. In some studies, the male/female ratio of ALS patients was as high as 2 to 1. In FALS mice, disease onset and mortality were earlier among males than among females. This sexual dimorphism was due to estrogen, as treatment with genistein, a phytoestrogen, eliminated the observed sexual dimorphism in FALS mice. Genistein treatment also protected against oxygen singlet-induced cerebral damage in vivo. However, sexual dimorphism was not observed in this model of stroke; and genistein was equally effective in males and females. These data suggest that genistein has both estrogen-dependent and estrogen-independent neuroprotective activities and it should be investigated as a prophylactic agent against pathologic conditions such as ALS and stroke."Stroke	Outcomes	"Depressive symptoms can often be observed after stroke. We prospectively evaluated patients at a stroke unit in order to determine the occurrence and severity of depressive symptoms in the acute phase of stroke in 82 patients 7 +/- 2 days after admission to the stroke unit. Severity of stroke was evaluated by the Scandinavian and Orgogozo scales and the Barthel index. Severity of depressive symptoms was measured by the 13-item Beck scale. Mean age of the patients was 65.8 years. No gender difference was observed in the severity of stroke or depressive symptoms. DSM-IV criteria of adjustment disorder with depressed mood were fulfilled by 27% of the patients. In this group, stroke was significantly more severe by the Barthel, Orgogozo, and Scandinavian scales (p < 0.001). Whereas Beck score was at least 10 in 19.5%, severe depressive symptoms (Beck score > or = 15) occurred in less than 5% of patients with acute stroke. Those who could not walk by themselves or who were aphasic had significantly higher mean Beck scores (6.3 +/- 5.1 vs 2.4 +/- 3.1, p < 0.001, and 7.0 +/- 5.8 vs 3.4 +/- 3.9, p = 0.002). Significant correlation was found between the severity of stroke and that of the depressive symptoms (r = -0.56, -0.58, and -0.54 for the Scandinavian, Orgogozo, and Barthel scales, p < 0.001)."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"At a young age, ischemic stroke is an uncommon event in which prothrombotic factors are likely to play an important role. In 202 referred cases, 105 men and 97 women, median age 39 years (range, 3 to 50), with a history of ischemic stroke and in 1036 age frequency-matched apparently healthy individuals from the same ethnic background, we have investigated whether inherited prothrombotic conditions increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Neither abnormal plasma levels of natural anticoagulants and fibrinogen nor significant increase of the prothrombin A20210 allele was found in stroke cases compared with controls. Hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 22.61), male sex (OR, 2.30), smoking (OR, 2.78) and alcohol habits (OR, 0.14), a personal history of venous thromboembolism (OR, 4.53), a family history of stroke (OR, 1.93), high circulating levels of fibrinogen (P=0.0190), and total cholesterol (P=0.101) were all independently associated with ischemic stroke. Compared with noncarriers, carriers of the factor V (FV) Leiden mutation (OR, 2.56), and to a lesser extent, of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) TT genotype (OR, 1.60), had an independent higher estimated risk of having a history of ischemic stroke. The relationship with the FV Leiden mutation was greater in women (OR, 3.95). Thus, in addition to established determinants, FV Leiden mutation is independently associated with the occurrence of ischemic stroke in this setting. The greater association in women suggests the possibility of an interaction of this genotype with female hormones."Stroke	Epidemiology	"There is scant population-based information on incidence and risk factors for ischemic stroke subtypes.We identified all 454 residents of Rochester, Minn, with a first ischemic stroke between 1985 and 1989 from the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage system. We used Stroke Data Bank criteria to assign infarct subtypes after reviewing medical records and brain imaging. We adjusted average annual incidence rates by age and sex to the US 1990 population and compared the age-adjusted frequency of stroke risk factors across ischemic stroke subtypes.Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates (per 100 000 population) were as follows: large-vessel cervical or intracranial atherosclerosis with >50% stenosis, 27; cardioembolic, 40; lacuna, 25; uncertain cause, 52; other or uncommon cause, 4. Sex differences in incidence rates were detected only for atherosclerosis with stenosis (47 [95% CI, 34 to 61] for men; 12 [95% CI, 7 to 17] for women). There was no difference in prior transient ischemic attack and hypertension among subtypes, and diabetes was not more common among patients with lacunar infarction than other common subtypes.The age-adjusted incidence rate of stroke due to stenosis of the large cervicocephalic vessels is nearly 4 times higher for men than for women. There is no association between preceding transient ischemic attack and stroke mechanism. Diabetes and hypertension are not more common among patients with lacunae. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates for ischemic stroke subtypes in this population can be compared with similarly determined rates from other populations."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Stroke community surveillance projects often focus on hospital data rates. We hypothesized that not including strokes which occurred in nursing homes or at home would differentially affect race/ethnic stroke rates.Texas vital statistics data were studied to compare age-specific (45 to 59, 60 to 74, and >/=75 years) location of stroke death for African Americans (AAs), Hispanic Americans (HAs), and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). Rate ratios are reported with 95% CIs; NHW is used as the referent group.During 1991 to 1996, there were 52 996 stroke deaths in Texas for individuals aged 45 years and older. HAs in the oldest age group (>/=75 years) were 33% more likely than NHWs to die in the hospital, and HAs aged 45 to 59 and 60 to 74 years were 4% and 10%, respectively, more likely to die in the hospital. AAs aged >/=75 years were 19% more likely to die in the hospital. HAs aged 60 to 74 years were 35% less likely to die in a nursing home, whereas HAs aged >/=75 years were 43% less likely than NHWs to die in a nursing home. AAs aged >/=75 were 33% less likely to die in a nursing home. Death at home was 19% more likely in HAs aged 60 to 74 years. Significant gender differences are also reported.Using hospital data alone would overestimate stroke mortality in the HA and AA groups. Stroke community surveillance projects should account for ethnic and gender differences in location of death to avoid bias in race/ethnic and gender comparisons."Stroke	Outcomes	"In stroke and other medical illnesses, secondary depression may be associated with different factors in women than in men. The authors examined 301 consecutive admissions for acute treatment of cerebrovascular accident for gender differences in depression, psychosocial factors, physical impairment, and lesion location. Women were twice as frequently diagnosed with major depression as men. Women with major depression had a greater frequency of left hemisphere lesions than men. In men, major depression was associated with greater impairment in activities of daily living, and greater severity of depression was associated with greater impairment in daily activities and social functioning. In women, greater severity of depression was associated with prior diagnosis of psychiatric disorder and cognitive impairment. These findings suggest a different nature of poststroke depression in men and women and may have implications for its treatment."Stroke	Epidemiology	"South Carolina and the southeastern United States have maintained the highest stroke mortality in the country. The Anderson and Pee Dee Stroke Study is an assessment of cerebrovascular disease incidence in 2 geographically defined communities in the stroke belt.Strokes were identified in the Anderson and Pee Dee areas of South Carolina. All hospitalized and out-of-hospital deaths occurring during 1990 among the residents of these 2 areas were included. Strokes were classified by an independent panel of neurologists using a standard protocol that included specific criteria for stroke and subtypes.The overall age-adjusted stroke incidence rates (per 100 000 population) were significantly higher in the Pee Dee population (293.1) compared with Anderson (211.2). The geographic differences were more dramatic in the younger age groups of 35 to 64 years. Likewise, incidence rates for blacks were nearly twice the rates for whites. The rates in the Pee Dee were higher than the rates from other studies in the United States and other parts of the world. Although the stroke subtypes did not vary between the 2 regions, race-sex differences were identified.High stroke incidence and disease rates persist for all 4 race-sex groups in the Southeast and reflect similar risks as mortality rates. However, geographic variability in stroke rates suggests that the pattern of disease in the region is not so much a ""belt"" of increased stroke in contiguous areas but rather more a ""necklace"" of different levels of risk. These results should be useful in the identification of factors associated with this geographic enigma."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Gender differences in the incidence of stroke and migraine appear to be related to circulating levels of estrogen; however, the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. Using resistance-sized arteries pressurized in vitro, we have found that myogenic tone of rat cerebral arteries differs between males and females. This difference appears to result from estrogen enhancement of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production. Luminal diameter was measured in middle cerebral artery segments from males and from females that were either untreated, ovariectomized (Ovx), or ovariectomized with estrogen replacement (Ovx + Est). The maximal passive diameters (0 Ca2+ + 1 mM EDTA) of arteries from all four groups were identical. In response to a series of 10-mmHg step increases in transmural pressure (20-80 mmHg), myogenic tone was greater and vascular distensibility less in arteries from males and Ovx females compared with arteries from either untreated or Ovx + Est females. In the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 1 microM), an NO synthase inhibitor, myogenic tone was increased in all arteries, but the differences among arteries from the various groups were abolished. Addition of L-arginine (1 mM) in the presence of L-NAME restored the differences in myogenic tone, suggesting that estrogen works through an NO-dependent mechanism in cerebral arteries. To determine the target of NO-dependent modulation of myogenic tone, we used tetraethylammonium (TEA; 1 mM) to inhibit large-conductance, calcium-activated K+ (BKCa) channels. In the presence of TEA, the myogenic tone of arteries from all groups increased significantly; however, myogenic tone in arteries from males and Ovx females remained significantly greater than in arteries from either untreated or Ovx + Est females. This suggests that activity of BKCa channels influences myogenic tone but does not directly mediate the effects of estrogen. Estrogen appears to alter myogenic tone by increasing cerebrovascular NO production and/or action."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Premenopausal women are at lower risk than men for stroke, but the comparative vulnerability to tissue injury once a cerebrovascular incident occurs is unknown. We hypothesized that female rats sustain less brain damage than males during experimental focal ischemia and that the gender difference in ischemic outcome can be eliminated by ovariectomy.Age-matched male (M), intact female (F), and ovariectomized female (O; plasma estradiol: 4.1+/-1.6 pg/mL compared with 7.4+/-1.5 in F and 4.0+/-1.1 in M) rats from two different strains, normotensive Wistar and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, were subjected to 2 hours of intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by 22 hours of reperfusion. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored throughout the ischemic period by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Infarction volume in the cerebral cortex (Ctx) and caudoputamen (CP) was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. In a separate cohort of M, F, and O Wistar rats, absolute rates of regional CBF were measured at the end of the ischemic period by quantitative autoradiography using [14C]iodoantipyrine.F rats of either strain had a smaller infarct size in Ctx and CP and a higher laser-Doppler flow during ischemia compared with respective M and O rats. Mean end-ischemic CBF was higher in F compared with M and O rats in CP, but not in Ctx. Cerebrocortical tissue volume with end-ischemic CBF < 10 mL/100 g/min was smaller in F than M rats, but not different from O rats.We conclude that endogenous estrogen improves stroke outcome during vascular occlusion by exerting both neuroprotective and flow-preserving effects."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Short stature has been associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), although the reason for the association remains unclear. Data on the relation between stature and stroke is more limited. We examined the association between stature and CHD as well as between stature and stroke in men and women from two communities in southeastern New England.Coronary heart disease and stroke events were abstracted from medical records between January 1980 and December 1991. An epidemiological diagnostic algorithm developed to measure CHD was used in the present analysis. Unadjusted relative risks (RR) and RR adjusted for age, smoking status, obesity, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol <0.91 mmol/l, total cholesterol >6.21 mmol/l, hypertension, diabetes, education, and being foreign born were computed by gender-specific height categories separately for men (n = 2826) and women (n = 3741).A graded inverse association between stature and risk of CHD was observed among men which persisted after adjustment for confounders. Men >69.75 inches had an 83% lower risk of CHD compared with men < or = 65 inches. In addition, the tallest men had a 67% decreased risk of stroke compared with the shortest men. No significant relation between stature and CHD or stroke was observed among women.These data support the hypothesis that stature is inversely related to both risk of CHD and stroke at least among men. Factors which might explain this association remain to be determined."Stroke	Outcomes	"To examine whether there were differences in lifestyle and performance of activities of daily living (ADL) between men and women in a population of elderly stroke patients.Case-comparison study.Sixty-eight men and 34 women who were elderly stroke patients living in the community with a spouse or family members were evaluated with the self-rating Barthel Index (SRBI), Frenchay Activities Index (FAI), Stroke Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and a pedometer for physical activity. Control subjects, 30 men and 30 women, were assessed with the FAI.Among the stroke subjects, there were no significant differences in age, SRBI, motor score of the SIAS, or physical activity between men and women; however, men had significantly lower values than did women for three FIM items and the total FIM score and for 6 FAI items and the total FAI score. Among control subjects, men had significantly lower values than did women for 7 FAI items and the total FAI score (Tukey's test, p < .05).Among elderly stroke patients, men received more support from family members in ADL performance and had less active lifestyles than did women, possibly because of cultural gender roles."Stroke	Outcomes	"To study gender differences in functional outcome unexpectedly observed in a follow-up study of stroke patients.Prospective study of hospitalized stroke patients, with evaluations in the subacute phase and after one year.Geriatric and general medical wards, and geriatric outpatient clinic of a university hospital serving as general hospital for a defined population.All stroke patients admitted during a six-month period (n = 165) were considered for inclusion, of whom 87 could be assessed in the subacute phase and 65 after one year.Motor function assessed by the SÌüdring Motor Evaluation of Stroke Patients; cognitive function by the Assessment of Stroke and other Brain Damage; and activities of daily living (ADL) function by the Barthel Index. Nursing-home residency registered after one year.Men achieved a significantly better score than women on most of the scales used. The age-adjusted odds for a man to have a higher Barthel score than a woman was 3.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-7.0) in the subacute phase and 3.3 (95% CI 1.2-9.0) after one year. Differences of the same magnitude were seen on the subscales of the motor and cognitive tests. The same trend was observed on all items of the Barthel Index. The males had a lower likelihood to be permanent nursing-home residents after one year, the age-adjusted odds ratio for nursing-home residency for females versus males being 6.3 (95% CI 1.2-65.3).Women seem to be functionally more impaired by stroke than men."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Fibrinogen is an independent risk factor for the development of stroke. Factors influencing circulating levels of fibrinogen include age, smoking, gender, and genetic factors. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between a polymorphism at position 448 of the B beta fibrinogen gene, fibrinogen levels, gender, and the risk of stroke. Fibrinogen levels were determined in 305 patients with stroke, taken within 10 days of the acute event and 3 months later, and in 197 control subjects. Initial fibrinogen levels in patients (4.49 g/L) were significantly higher than at 3 months (3.85 g/L, P < .0001), consistent with resolution of the acute-phase response. At 3 months, levels were only significantly higher than for control subjects in the male patients (3.86 g/L versus 3.31 g/L, P < .0001). Fibrinogen levels were associated with B beta 448 genotype in male patients at 3 months (1/1 = 3.62 g/L, 1/2 + 2/2 = 4.27 g/L, P = .01). There was a significant difference in the genotype distribution in female patients and control subjects (patients: 1/1 = 95, 1/2 = 34, 2/2 = 6; control subjects: 1/1 = 61, 1/2 = 50, 2/2 = 3, P = .008). These data suggest that the mechanisms linking fibrinogen and the development of cerebrovascular disease are different in males and females. In male patients, the increase in fibrinogen levels may be influenced by environmental factors, while in females there may be a functional difference in the fibrinogen molecule unrelated to fibrinogen levels."Stroke	Clinical	"Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) devices are increasingly used in the assessment of hypertension, but their value in patients after a stroke is unknown, despite the fact that hypertension is an important cause of stroke and many patients have relatively high blood pressure (BP) levels at presentation. We therefore investigated the clinical use of a 24-hour oscillometric ABPM device in patients after acute stroke. We also investigated ABPM in different types of stroke (thrombosis, hemorrhage, and transient ischemic attack) and ethnic and sex differences.BP was measured manually with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer, and ABPM measurements were made with an oscillometric device. The first reading obtained with the ABPM device was compared with simultaneous manual BP measurements. Mean daytime and nighttime pressures were also analyzed to determine the frequency of nocturnal BP falls (""dipping"").We studied 86 patients (48 men; mean +/- SD age, 64.2 +/- 9.2 years) admitted with acute-onset stroke (ictus within 12 hours) in a district general hospital. Thirty-one patients (36.0%) had a previous history of hypertension. The median percentage of successful BP readings by ABPM was 92% (interquartile range, 72 to 98). There was no significant difference in manual BP levels compared with the first simultaneous systolic or diastolic ABPM measurements. Systolic BPs recorded by ABPM were significantly higher in black patients with acute stroke and in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, who also showed a trend toward higher nocturnal BPs. There was no difference in BPs between men and women and those who were alive or dead 6 months later (P = NS). There was also no difference between mean day and night systolic BP (mean difference, 1.9 mm Hg; P = .08), although mean daytime diastolic BP was higher than mean nighttime diastolic BP (mean difference, 2.4 mm Hg; P = .01). Patients with stroke therefore demonstrated a loss of diurnal BP rhythm and may be considered ""nondippers""; there was also a trend toward ""reverse dipping"" in patients with intracranial hemorrhage.This study demonstrates higher systolic BPs as recorded by ABPM (but not manually) in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage than in those with cerebral infarcts; higher levels were also found in blacks. ABPM recordings are useful in the assessment of BP in patients with stroke, who may be considered nondippers."Stroke	Review	"This study examined the hypothesis of greater functional asymmetry in the male compared with the female brain for contralesional spatial neglect. One hundred thirty-eight consecutive patients with computed tomography verified unilateral first strokes were examined within two months of onset. An aggregate measure of neglect was based on four clinical tasks: copying/drawing, line bisection, line cancellation, and figure cancellation. The incidence and severity of neglect were significantly greater after right-than left-hemisphere lesions and equal in men and women. Sex differences were not found between anterior and posterior groups after left- or right-hemisphere strokes. When neglect was based on different scores between ipsilateral versus contralesional response times on a Visual Search Task, the incidence was higher in females than males with right-hemisphere lesions."Stroke	Outcomes	"Variations in stroke mortality could be explained by changes in factors that act around the time of death (period effect) and by risk factors that are present in early life (cohort effect). The aim of this study was to analyze mortality rates for stroke in Sweden during the period 1969 through 1993 and to predict mortality trends until the year 2003, taking into account age, cohort, and period effects.Age-period-cohort models were used to analyze stroke mortality in Sweden between 1969 and 1993 and to predict age-specific death rates and total number of deaths for the periods 1994 through 1998 and 1999 through 2003.Mortality rates in the age group 25 to 89 years decreased from 203 to 143 per 100,000 for men and from 185 to 113 per 100,000 for women over the study period (average annual decrease of 1.3% for men and 1.9% for women). The decline was present in all age groups. The full age-period-cohort model provided an acceptable fit in both sexes. Predictions based on these models gave a mortality rate of 122 and 92 per 100,000 for the period 1999-2003 in men and women, respectively. Despite an aging and increasing population, the total number of stroke deaths in Sweden is predicted to decline by approximately 10% in both men and women from 1989-1993 to 1999-2003.Both factors, cohort and calendar period, contain relevant information to explain the decline in stroke mortality trends in Sweden. Predictions indicate that the decline of both age-specific and total mortality will continue."Stroke	Epidemiology	"There is considerable heterogeneity of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) incidence throughout Scotland. We sought to relate this geographical variation to differences in population risk factors.A computer search of linked national hospital discharge data was performed. Individuals were selected if they had been coded with a diagnosis of CVD (ICD-9 430-438), 1984-1986. Age-sex specific rates were correlated to deprivation score and estimated population risk factors for the 22 local government districts of the Scottish Heart Health Study (1984-1986).Men were more commonly admitted in all districts except one, with an overall male:female ratio of 1.43 (P < 0.0001). Rates for men were significantly higher in populations with elevated mean diastolic blood pressure, greater mean alcohol consumption, and where fewer men ate fruit. The most significant associations of male CVD hospital admissions were with population density and deprivation. A similar pattern was found for women, where CVD was significantly associated with elevated diastolic blood pressure, more smokers and fewer non-smokers, and fewer eating fruit. Again rates were higher in densely populated, deprived districts. Multiple linear regression identified the proportion for men. Sex difference was explained by vitamin C intake.Geographical variation in CVD rates in Scotland is related to identifiable population risk factors for atherosclerosis and urban environment."Stroke	Outcomes	"Knowledge of the frequency and remission of aphasia is essential for the rehabilitation of stroke patients and provides insight into the brain organization of language. We studied prospectively and consecutively an unselected and community-based sample of 881 patients with acute stroke. Assessment of aphasia was done at admission, weekly during the hospital stay, and at a 6-month follow-up using the aphasia score of the Scandinavian Stroke Scale. Thirty-eight percent had aphasia at the time of admission; at discharge 18% had aphasia. Sex was not a determinant of aphasia in stroke, and no sex difference in the anterior-posterior distribution of lesions was found. The remission curve was steep: Stationary language function in 95% was reached within 2 weeks in those with initial mild aphasia, within 6 weeks in those with moderate, and within 10 weeks in those with severe aphasia. A valid prognosis of aphasia could be made within 1 to 4 weeks after the stroke depending on the initial severity of aphasia. Initial severity of aphasia was the only clinically relevant predictor of aphasia outcome. Sex, handedness, and side of stroke lesion were not independent outcome predictors, and the influence of age was minimal."Stroke	Outcomes	"Aphasia was present in 19.4% of the men and 22.5% of the women in the Stroke Data Bank. There were no gender differences in aphasia incidence among the intracerebral hemorrhages. Aphasia was more frequent among women with infarcts (37.0%) than men (28.3%). When stroke mechanism was controlled for, there was an excess of aphasia among the women with stroke due to cardiac embolism. When stroke site was controlled for, there were no gender differences in aphasia frequency. Wernicke's, global, and anomic aphasias were more common in women than men; Broca's aphasia was somewhat more common in men. Although there were no gender differences in infarct size overall, men with aphasia had larger infarcts than women with aphasia. Although gender differences were small, the infarct lesions producing aphasia in men were more posteriorly placed and the infarct lesions in women were more anteriorly placed, suggesting possible gender differences in the positioning of the language zone in the brain."Stroke	Epidemiology	"We wished to test the validity of a stroke probability point system from the Framingham Study for a sample of the population of Copenhagen, Denmark. In the Framingham cohort, the regression model of Cox established the effect on stroke of the following factors: age, systolic blood pressure, the use of antihypertensive therapy, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, prior cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Derived from this model, stroke probabilities were computed for each sex based on a point system. The authors claimed that a physician can use this system for individual stroke prediction.The Copenhagen City Heart Study is a prospective survey of 19,698 women and men aged 20 years or older invited to two cardiovascular examinations at 5-year intervals. The baseline examination included 3015 men and 3501 women aged 55 to 84 years; 474 stroke events occurred during 10 years of follow-up. In both cohorts initial cases of stroke and transient ischemic attack recorded during 10 years of follow-up were used. We used the statistical model from the Framingham Study to establish a corresponding stroke probability point system using data from the Copenhagen City Heart Study population. We then compared the effects of the relevant risk factors, their combinations, and the corresponding stroke probabilities. We also assessed stroke events during 10 years of follow-up in several subgroups of the Copenhagen population with different combinations of risk factors.For the Copenhagen City Heart Study population some of the risk factors (diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy) had regression coefficients different from those of the Framingham Study population. Consequently, the probability of stroke for persons presenting these risk factors and their combinations varied between the two studies. For some other risk factors (age, blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease), no major differences were found. The recorded frequency of stroke events in subgroups of the Copenhagen population was compatible with the estimated probability intervals of stroke from the Copenhagen City Heart Study and with those from the Framingham Study, but these intervals were very large.The majority of risk factors for stroke identified by the Framingham Study also had a significant effect in the Copenhagen City Heart Study population. The differences found could be due partly to different definitions of these factors used by the two studies. Although estimated stroke probabilities based on point systems from the Copenhagen City Heart Study and the Framingham Study were similar, the points scored in the two systems did not always correspond to the same combination of risk factors. Such systems can be used for estimating stroke probability in a given population, provided that the statistical confidence limits are known and the definitions of risk factors are compatible. However, because of the large statistical uncertainty, a prognostic index should not be applied for individual prediction unless it is used as an indicator of high relative risk associated with the simultaneous presence of several risk factors."Stroke	Epidemiology	"To determine the incidence and case fatality of seven distinct subtypes of stroke in Perth, Western Australia.A population-based descriptive epidemiological study.All residents of a geographically defined segment of the Perth metropolitan area (estimated population 138,708 persons) who had a stroke or transient ischaemic attack between 20 February 1989 and 19 August 1990, inclusive.The following subtypes of stroke were classified according to standard clinical, radiological and pathological criteria: types of cerebral infarction, namely, large artery (thrombotic) occlusive infarction (LAOI), cerebral embolic infarction (EMBI), lacunar infarction (LACI) and boundary zone infarction (BZI); primary intracerebral haemorrhage (PICH); subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH); and stroke of undetermined cause.Over the 18-month study period 536 stroke events were registered, of which 86% (95% confidence interval, 83%-89%) had a defined ""pathological"" diagnosis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging or necropsy. Cerebral infarction accounted for 71% of cases (95% CI, 68%-75%), PICH 11% (95% CI, 9%-14%) and SAH 4% (95% CI, 2%-5%). The 382 cases of cerebral infarction included LAOI (in approximately 71%), EMBI (15%), LACI (10%) and BZI (5%). While the incidence of all subtypes of stroke increased with age, there were age and sex differences in their proportional frequency, management and prognosis: patients with PICH, SAH and EMBI were more likely to be admitted to hospital, and these conditions carried the highest early case fatality. Over all, the 28-day case fatality was 24% (95% CI, 20%-28%), but varied from 0 for LACI and BZI, to 37% (95% CI, 15%-59%) for SAH and 35% (CI, 23%-47%) for PICH.In this study, we found considerable differences in incidence rates, the effect of age and sex on incidence rates, and prognosis for the different subtypes of stroke. Hospital-based studies are likely to be selectively biased by emphasising strokes that are severe and require admission to hospital. These data have important implications in the design and evaluation of clinical trials of therapy for stroke."Stroke	Epidemiology	"To determine the age and sex specific incidence, and case fatality of stroke in Perth, Western Australia.A population-based descriptive epidemiological study.All residents of a geographically defined segment of the Perth metropolitan area (population 138,708) who had a stroke or transient ischaemic attack between 20 February 1989 and 19 August 1990, inclusive.Definite acute ""first-ever-in-a-lifetime"" (first-ever) and recurrent stroke classified according to standard definitions and criteria.During the 18-month study period, 536 stroke events occurred among 492 patients, 69% of which were first-ever strokes. The crude annual event rate for all strokes was 258 (95% confidence interval 231-285) per 100,000, and the overall case fatality at 28 days was 24% (95% CI, 20%-28%). The crude annual incidence for first-ever strokes was 178 (95% CI, 156-200) per 100,000; 189 (95% CI, 157-221) per 100,000 in males and 166 (95% CI, 136-196) per 100,000 in females. The corresponding rates, age-adjusted to the ""world"" population, were 132 (95% CI, 109-155) for males and 77 (95% CI, 60-94) for females.In contrast to mortality rates for ischaemic heart disease, the incidence of stroke in Australia appears little different from that for several other Western countries. For both males and females the incidence of stroke rises exponentially with increasing age. Although the sex-dependent difference in the risk of stroke is greatest in middle age, males are at greater risk of stroke even among the most elderly. To determine the incidence of stroke accurately, population-based studies of stroke need exhaustive and overlapping sources of case ascertainment. If only cases admitted to hospital had been used, we would have underestimated the rate of stroke among the most elderly by almost 40%. We estimate that approximately 37,000 people, about 50% of whom are over the age of 75, suffer a stroke each year in Australia."Stroke	Epidemiology	"We present here the results of the Sino-MONICA-Beijing stroke study based on 700,000 Beijing residents in 1984-1986. To compare incidence rates for stroke with other communities and countries, we adopted the criteria of the WHO Collaborative Study of 17 centers which used the same definition and methodology as was used in this study. Over the 3-year period of the study, 2,593 stroke events were registered in the 25- to 74-year age-group. The incidence rate for all strokes was 189.5/100,000 and the incidence rate for first strokes was 133.6/100,000. Men had a significantly higher incidence rate than women (all strokes 219.7/100,000 for male vs. 160.5/100,000 for female, OR = 1.32, 99% limits 1.19-1.46; first strokes 151.6/100,000 for male vs. 116.4/100,000 for female, OR = 1.25, 99% limits 1.11-1.42). In comparison with other studies, age-adjusted incidence rate of stroke in Beijing was higher than in other countries, especially for hemorrhagic stroke. The proportion of hemorrhagic stroke related to other types of stroke was also higher in Beijing. Further analysis of the cases confirmed by computerized tomography also supported this finding. Unlike the incidence rates, the 4-week case fatality rate for women, 39.5%, was higher than for men, 32.8%. This finding was confirmed by a multiple logistic analysis controlling for age (p less than 0.001) and for previous stroke (p less than 0.001). The adjusted sex difference is also significant (OR = 1.37, p less than 0.001). In addition, results showed that men had a higher hospitalization rate than women. More women than men were treated at home, possibly indicating better medical care for men."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Twenty-four hour postischemic neuronal necrosis was compared in male vs. female Mongolian gerbils subjected to a 3-h period of severe incomplete hemispheric ischemia produced by unilateral carotid occlusion. The incidence of stroke-prone males was 42.9% versus 26.7% for the females. Among the stroke-prone animals, the males displayed significantly greater neuronal necrosis at 24 h after ischemia compared to the females in the cerebral cortex and CA1 region of the hippocampus. In the CA1 region of the stroke-prone males, only 2.0% of the normal neuronal population remained by 24 h compared to 36.8% in the stroke-prone females (p less than 0.02). In the cerebral cortex, the males had only 19.9% of normal versus 58.2% in the females (p less than 0.05). In a second series of mechanistic experiments, no differences in cortical blood flow (CBF) were disclosed between preselected male and female stroke-prone animals before, during, or for 2 h after ischemia. As with the CBF, the extent of cortical extracellular hypocalcia during ischemia did not differ significantly. However, the degree of postischemic recovery of cortical extracellular calcium was significantly better in the females from 30 min to 2 h after reperfusion. In the same experiments, hemispheric vitamin E levels were measured at the 2 h time point as an index of postischemic brain lipid peroxidation. No difference in baseline vitamin E levels was observed between male and female sham-operated gerbils. In the males subjected to 3 h of ischemia plus 2 h of reperfusion, the hemispheric vitamin E decreased by 43.5% compared to the sham-operated males.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"Stroke	Outcomes	"In a retrospective analysis of elderly patients with aphasia who had had a stroke, the success of therapy was sex-related. In the women treated, significantly better results could be achieved despite the fact that on average the women were older, lived in worse social conditions and had a shorter course of therapy than the men. The main reason for our findings may be sex-related role behaviour."Stroke	Management	"The aim of this study was to observe whether acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) had different effects in both sexes. Out of the ischemic stroke patients who were admitted to the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), those who had not taken ASA or ASA-like drugs for more than 2 weeks were selected for this study. For the diagnosis of ischemic stroke, computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed in all cases, and for differential diagnosis, other necessary procedures were employed in a few cases. The serum salicylate (SA) level was measured by Trinder's method, thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha by radioimmunoassay, threshold concentration of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by Born's method, and circulating platelet aggregates (CPA) by Wu and Hoak's method. The present study showed that the means of serum SA levels after administration of the same dose of ASA were not significantly different between the two sexes. After ingestion of ASA, a single dose of 75 mg, 300 mg or 600 mg, or 300 mg 4 times a day, mean plasma TXB2 levels were significantly suppressed and mean threshold concentrations of ADP were significantly elevated in the two sexes. After administration of above-mentioned various doses of ASA, the abnormally high plasma TXB2 levels and abnormally low threshold concentrations of ADP and CPA ratios were significantly normalized in both male and female patients. Plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were not influenced by ingestion of ASA 75 mg, but significantly depressed by administration of ASA 300 mg in both sexes. There were no sex differences in the antiplatelet effect of ASA in this experiment."Stroke	Epidemiology	"Out of 329 cases of stroke registered in Benghazi between November 1, 1983 and October 30, 1984, 63 patients comprising 32 males and 31 females belonged to the 15-40-year age group (stroke in the young). The annual age-specific crude incidence of stroke in the young was 39.3 and 40.3 per 100,000 for men and women, respectively. The age-adjusted incidence rate for both sexes for the age-specific (15-40 years) population was 47 per 100,000. The sex-dependent difference in the incidence was not statistically significant. These results emphasize that the high incidence of stroke in the young in Benghazi is not a reflection of the age distribution of the population. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease and hypercholesterolemia were important components of high stroke profile in the young. One or more risk factors were identified in 78% of total young stroke victims and in all the patients under the age of 30. Eight young stroke subjects died during the study period."Stroke	Outcomes	"Moderate and severely impaired poststroke aphasic patients followed in a rehabilitation medicine program were systematically examined initially between 4 and 6 months poststroke and again between one and 2 1/2 years postonset. No gender differences were found on ratings of everyday communication function or certain measures of language, specifically auditory comprehension and the spontaneous generation of spoken words."Stroke	Pathophysiology	"Thromboxane B2 (TXB2) is the stable metabolite of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a potent vasoconstrictor which induces irreversible platelet aggregation. The inhibition of TXA2 by aspirin and other agents has been associated with improved outcome following cerebral ischemia in clinical and laboratory studies. To investigate the relation of TXA2 production to cerebral ischemia, we measured the urinary excretion of TXA2 metabolites in 30 patients with acute cerebral ischemia. Urinary immunoreactive TXB2 for this group of ischemic patients was elevated compared to normals, 1818 +/- 344 pg/mg Cr (mean +/- SE) vs 880 +/- 122 pg/mg Cr (p less than .05). Among various subsets of the ischemic patients, those with severe stroke (2108 +/- 536 pg/mg Cr), large vessel disease (1646 +/- 335 pg/mg Cr), and cardiogenic stroke (2712 +/- 1045 pg/mg Cr) were all significantly elevated. Of the stroke patients, only the males demonstrated this significant elevation. These elevations of urinary immunoreactive TXB2 are consistent with a role for increased platelet activation in the pathogenesis of some forms of cerebral ischemia and suggest that gender differences in arachidonate metabolism may exist for stroke patients."Stroke	Outcomes	"Our original paper on the influence of the sex of the patients on the cognitive effects of unilateral brain damage mainly described the differences found between the various lesion groups (left/right, male/female) and said little about comparisons between these groups and our control subjects. Such comparisons are examined here; they confirm that the major sex differences after such brain damage appear in tasks intended to involve nonverbal processing. This evidence supports the hypothesis that women, to a greater extent than men, may employ verbal, left hemisphere processing to solve ostensibly nonverbal problems."Stroke	Outcomes	Sex differences and age distribution are examined in various types of aphasia and in right hemisphere-damaged patients due to acute infarct. The language and performance deficits were measured by a standardized test allowing us to group patients meaningfully. The higher male to female ratio of aphasia is shown to relate to a similar sex distribution in infarcts rather than to sex differences in cerebral organization. Broca's aphasics were somewhat younger than the other groups and the slight difference may be related to pathophysiological factors favouring embolic strokes in the anterior territory of the middle cerebral artery. Sex and aphasia types were not significantly different in various age groups except about 50 years of age where the female aphasics reversed the ratio.Stroke	Epidemiology	"We present the methodology and some preliminary findings of a population-based stroke incidence register operating in Tilburg (about 150,000 persons), The Netherlands. From October 1, 1978 to March 31, 1979, 152 new strokes occurred giving an estimated overall incidence (per 100,000 population) for total and first attacks of 202 and 162, respectively. No major sex difference in stroke risk (all ages) was noted, although males did have a significantly higher incidence at 55--64 years of age. Stroke incidence increased strikingly with age. Thromboembolic infarcts comprised 83% and intracranial hemorrhage 13% of attacks. Males and females differed little in distribution of stroke types. The proportion of cerebral infarction was higher among older than younger cases. The opposite was true regarding intracranial hemorrhage. Embolic infarcts constituted a significantly higher proportion of cases at 65--74 years of age than at other ages. Hemiplegia and speech deficits dominated the clinical picture at onset. The 3-week case fatality for all strokes was 26%. Both a lowering of consciousness (found among 38% of cases during the first 24 hours) and a history of prior stroke were found related to a reduction in survival. Of patients surviving 3 weeks 25% were completely dependent and 25% partially dependent upon others for personal care."Stroke	Management	"Five hundred and eighty-five patients with threatened stroke were followed in a randomized clinical trial for an average of 26 months to determine whether aspirin or sulfinpyrazone, singly or in combination, influence the subsequent occurrence of continuing transient ischemic attacks, stroke or death. Eighty-five subjects went on to stroke, and 42 died. Aspirin reduced the risk of continuing ischemic attacks, stroke or death by 19 per cent (P less than 0.05) and also reduced risk for the ""harder,"" more important events of stroke or death by 31 percent (P less than 0.05), but this effect was sex-dependent: among men, the risk reduction for stroke or death was 48 per cent (P less than 0.005), whereas no significant trend was observed among women. For sulfinpyrazone, no risk reduction of ischemic attacks was observed, and the 10 per cent risk reduction of stroke or death was not statistically significant. No overall synergism or antagonism was observed between the two drugs. We conclude that aspirin is an efficacious drug for men with threatened stroke."mycardial	MANAG	"Our aim was to compare the biopsychosocial characteristics of young women with those of older women who were enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation (CR). The baseline characteristics of women who prematurely terminated CR participation were also explored.Baseline physiological and psychosocial indices of women â‰¤ 55 years compared with older women eligible for CR were evaluated 1 week before enrolling in either a traditional CR or a gender-specific, motivationally enhanced CR.A greater proportion of young women (n = 65) compared with their older counterparts (n = 187) were diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction during their index hospitalization. They demonstrated lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, higher total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios, and greater body weight compared with older women and were more likely to be active smokers. Young women compared with older women reported significantly worse health perceptions, quality of life, optimism, hope, social support, and stress and significantly more symptoms of depression and anxiety. Women who prematurely terminated CR participation were younger, more obese, with worse quality of life, and greater symptoms of depression and anxiety compared with women completing CR.Notable differences in physiological and psychosocial profiles of young women compared with older women enrolled in CR were evident, placing them at high risk for nonadherence to secondary prevention interventions as well as increased risk for disease progression and subsequent cardiac adverse events. Continued existence of these health differentials represents an important public health problem and warrants further research to address these age-related and sex-specific health disparities among women with coronary heart disease."mycardial	OUTC	"To assess whether younger, but not older, women in China have higher in-hospital mortality following ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) compared with men, and whether this relationship varied over the last decade or across rural/urban areas.We analysed a nationally representative sample of 11â€…986 patients with STEMI from 162 Chinese hospitals in 2001, 2006 and 2011, in the China PEACE-Retrospective AMI Study and compared in-hospital mortality between women and men with gender-age interactions in multivariable models.The overall in-hospital mortality rate was higher in women compared with men (17.2% vs 9.1%, p<0.0001; unadjusted OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.85 to 2.33). The unadjusted OR for mortality in women, compared with men, was 2.20 (95% CI 1.59 to 3.04), 2.21 (95% CI 1.74 to 2.79), 1.37 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.65) and 1.25 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.63) for ages <60, 60-69, 70-79 and â‰¥80â€…years, respectively. After adjustment for patient characteristics, hospital characteristics and year of study, the OR for mortality comparing women with men was 1.69 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.83), 1.64 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.19), 1.15 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.46) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.11) for ages <60, 60-69, 70-79 and â‰¥80â€…years, respectively. The gender-age interaction for mortality was statistically significant (p=0.009), even after adjustment for a wide range of confounders, and did not vary over time or across rural/urban areas.Among a Chinese population with STEMI, gender differences in early mortality were age-dependent and greatest in the younger groups <70â€…years of age."mycardial	OUTC	"We examined the association of sex with clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients following myocardial infarction (MI) in the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT).A total of 4570 women and 10â€‰133 men with heart failure (HF), left ventricular systolic dysfunction or both were enrolled 0.5-10â€‰days after myocardial infarction (MI) and followed for a median of 24.7â€‰months. Compared with men, women were older, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to present in Killip Class III/IV and experience post-infarction angina or HF. After adjusting for baseline differences, both short-term and longer-term mortality were similar in men and women. However, women were more likely than men to experience the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, MI, HF, stroke, and resuscitation from cardiac arrest [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI); 1.06-1.24, P=0.001], mainly owing to an increased risk of hospitalization for HF (adjusted HR 1.36; 95% CI 1.22-1.52; P<0.001). In a subset of patients who underwent echocardiographic study (n=603), women had smaller left ventricular volumes indexed by body size than men but similar ejection fractions and similar changes in ventricular volumes from baseline to 1â€‰month and 20â€‰months.In VALIANT, the risk of HF following MI was higher in women than men after adjusting for age and comorbidities, although the risk of other fatal and non-fatal outcomes were similar. The higher long-term risk of HF in women appears to be independent of the extent of left ventricular systolic dysfunction or remodelling compared with men."mycardial	REVIEW	"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the most frequent cause of death in both men and women. Many studies on CVD have included mostly men, and the knowledge about coronary artery disease (CAD) in women has largely been extrapolated from studies primarily focused on men. The influence of various risk factors is different between men and women; untoward effects of smoking of CAD are greater in women than men. Furthermore, the effect of the menopause is important in women, with higher incidence of plaque erosion in young women versus greater incidence of plaque rupture in older women. This review focuses on differences in plaque morphology in men and women presenting with sudden coronary death and acute myocardial infarction. "mycardial	OUTC	"The aim of this study was to investigate the trends in 28-day and 1-year mortality rates in patients hospitalized for a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Norway during the period 2001-2009. Potential age group and gender differences in these trends were also examined.In this retrospective nationwide cohort study, patients hospitalized for a first AMI between 2001 and 2009 were identified in the Cardiovascular Disease in Norway 1994-2009 (CVDNOR) project and followed for 1 year.Trends in 28-day and 1-year mortality [both all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality] were investigated.A total of 115,608 patients (60.6% men) were hospitalized for a first AMI during the study period. Mortality at 28 days was reduced annually by 3.8% overall and by 6.7%, 4.1% and 2.6% in patients aged 25-64, 65-84 and â‰¥85 years, respectively (all Ptrend < 0.001). In addition, 1-year all-cause mortality was reduced annually by 2.0% overall (Ptrend < 0.001) and by 3.7% (Ptrend = 0.02), 2.5% (Ptrend < 0.001) and 1.1% (Ptrend < 0.001) in patients aged 25-64, 65-84 and â‰¥85 years, respectively. Furthermore, 1-year CVD mortality was reduced overall by 6.2% annually; a reduction was observed in all age groups. Finally, 1-year non-CVD mortality increased annually overall by 3.9% due to an increase in patients aged â‰¥65 years.Mortaity at 28 days after the first AMI declinedin Norway between 2001 and 2009 in both men and women and in all age groups. All-cause mortality at 1 year also declined both in men and women due to decreases in CVD mortality rates, whilst non-CVD mortality rates increased amongst patients â‰¥65 years of age."mycardial	PP	"An unclear issue is whether gender may influence at cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). We evaluated left ventricle remodeling in female and male rats post-MI.Rats were submitted to anterior descending coronary occlusion. Echocardiographic evaluations were performed on the first and sixth week post-occlusion to determine myocardial infarction size and left ventricle systolic function (FAC, fractional area change). Pulsed Doppler was applied to analyze left ventricle diastolic function using the following parameters: E wave, A wave, E/A ratio. Two-way ANOVA was applied for comparisons, complemented by the Bonferroni test. A Pâ‰¤=0.05 was considered significant.There were no significant differences between genders for morphometric parameters on first (MI [Female (FE): 44.0 Â± 5.0 vs. Male (MA): 42.0 Â± 3.0%]; diastolic [FE: 0.04 Â± 0.003 vs. MA: 0.037 Â± 0.005, mm/g] and systolic [FE: 0.03 Â± 0.0004 vs. MA: 0.028 Â± 0.005, mm/g] diameters of left ventricle) and sixth (MI [FE: 44.0 Â± 5.0 vs. MA: 42.0 Â± 3.0, %]; diastolic [FE: 0.043 Â± 0.01 vs. MA: 0.034 Â± 0.005, mm/g] and systolic [FE: 0.035 Â± 0.01 vs. MA: 0.027 Â± 0.005, mm/g] of LV) week. Similar findings were reported for left ventricle functional parameters on first (FAC [FE: 34.0 Â± 6.0 vs. MA: 32.0 Â± 4.0, %]; wave E [FE: 70.0 Â± 18.0 vs. MA: 73.0 Â± 14.0, cm/s]; wave A [FE: 20.0 Â± 12.0 vs. MA: 28.0 Â± 13.0, cm/s]; E/A [FE: 4.9 Â± 3.4 vs. MA: 3.3 Â± 1.8]) and sixth (FAC [FE: 29.0 Â± 7.0 vs. MA: 31.0 Â± 7.0, %]; wave E [FE: 85.0 Â± 18.0 vs. MA: 87.0 Â± 20.0, cm/s]; wave A [FE: 20.0 Â± 11.0 vs. MA: 28.0 Â± 17.0, cm/s]; E/A [FE: 6.2 Â± 4.0 vs. MA: 4.6 Â± 3.4]) week.Gender does not influence left ventricle remodeling post-MI in rats."mycardial	OUTC	"Cardiogenic shock (CS) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with high mortality. Previous studies regarding gender-specific differences in CS are conflicting and there are insufficient data for the presence of gender-associated differences in the contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention era. Aim of this study was therefore to investigate gender-specific differences in a large cohort of AMI patients with CS undergoing contemporary treatment.In the randomized Intra-aortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock II (IABP-SHOCK II) trial, 600 patients with CS complicating AMI undergoing early revascularization were assigned to therapy with or without intra-aortic balloon pump. We compared sex-specific differences in these patients with regard to baseline and procedural characteristics as well as short- and long-term clinical outcome.Of 600 patients 187 (31%) were female. Women were significantly older than men and had a significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure at presentation (p < 0.05 for all). Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were more frequent in women, whereas smoking was more frequent in men (p < 0.05 for all). Women showed a higher mortality within the first day after randomization (p = 0.004). However, after multivariable adjustment this numerical difference was no longer statistically significant. No gender-related differences in clinical outcome were observed after 1, 6 and 12 months of follow-up.In this large-scale multicenter study in patients with CS complicating AMI, women had a worse-risk profile in comparison to men. No significant gender-related differences in treatment as well as short- and long-term outcome were observed."mycardial	OUTC	"Women are more likely than men to experience adverse cardiac events after ST-elevation myocardial (STEMI). Whether differences in infarct size or reperfusion contribute to sex differences in outcomes is unknown.Women were older, were more commonly affected by hypertension and renal impairment, and had a 50.5-minute longer delay to reperfusion. There were no differences in infarct size, microvascular obstruction, or reperfusion success. At 30 days, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as death, reinfarction, new-onset severe heart failure, or rehospitalization for heart failure, were more common in women (11.1% vs 5.4%, hazard ratio 2.09, 95% CI 1.03-4.27, P = .04). After multivariable adjustment, age, but not sex or time to reperfusion, was an independent predictor of MACE.In the INFUSE-AMI randomized trial, women with anterior STEMI experienced a higher rate of MACE, attributable to older age. Despite longer delay from symptom onset to reperfusion therapy, there was no difference between women and men in infarct size or reperfusion success."mycardial	OUTC	"Younger age and female sex are both associated with greater mental stress in the general population, but limited data exist on the status of perceived stress in young and middle-aged patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction.We examined sex difference in stress, contributing factors to this difference, and whether this difference helps explain sex-based disparities in 1-month recovery using data from 3572 patients with acute myocardial infarction (2397 women and 1175 men) 18 to 55 years of age. The average score of the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale at baseline was 23.4 for men and 27.0 for women (P<0.001). Higher stress in women was explained largely by sex differences in comorbidities, physical and mental health status, intrafamily conflict, caregiving demands, and financial hardship. After adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics, women had worse recovery than men at 1 month after acute myocardial infarction, with mean differences in improvement score between women and men ranging from -0.04 for EuroQol utility index to -3.96 for angina-related quality of life (P<0.05 for all). Further adjustment for baseline stress reduced these sex-based differences in recovery to -0.03 to -3.63, which, however, remained statistically significant (P<0.05 for all). High stress at baseline was associated with significantly worse recovery in angina-specific and overall quality of life, as well as mental health status. The effect of baseline stress on recovery did not vary between men and women.Among young and middle-aged patients, higher stress at baseline is associated with worse recovery in multiple health outcomes after acute myocardial infarction. Women perceive greater psychological stress than men at baseline, which partially explains women's worse recovery."mycardial	MANAG	"Studies have shown sex-based disparities in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) management and prognosis. We sought to compare women and men undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI in a large, prospective, contemporary context.The Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial randomized 3,602 patients (23.4% women and 76.6% men) with STEMI presenting within 12 hr of onset of symptoms to bivalirudin or heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and to PCI with drug-eluting or bare metal stents.Compared with men, women presented later after symptom onset and were more often treated with medical management alone (6.9% vs. 4.7%; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). Women had significantly higher rates of 3-year major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and major bleeding. After adjusting for baseline differences, female sex remained an independent predictor of major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-2.33; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) but not of MACE (HR 1.09; 95% CI 0.91-1.32; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.35).This study found that women with STEMI are at increased risk of bleeding as compared to men. While female sex may not directly contribute to increased risk of MACE, it is, however, associated with the presence of comorbidities that increase the risk of ischemic events long-term. Further dedicated studies are needed to confirm these findings and to assess strategies to optimize both the initial emergent treatment and long-term management in this high-risk subset.

Chest pain, which is often described as chest pressure, tightness, or a squeezing sensation, is the most frequent symptom in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction. Although the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is often based on typical changes on a surface electrocardiogram and on changes in cardiac biomarkers, there is a need to better recognize and understand the impact of sex on symptoms among patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome or acute myocardial infarction. We briefly review the pathophysiology of ischemic symptoms, discuss potential mechanisms for variation in ischemic symptoms by sex, and summarize recent publications that have addressed sex differences in ischemic symptoms. "mycardial	EPI	"The incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in men exceeds that in women. The extent of this sex disparity varies widely between countries. Variations may also exist between ethnic minority groups and the majority population, but scientific evidence is lacking.A nationwide register-based cohort study was conducted (nâ€‰=â€‰7,601,785) between 1997 and 2007. Cox Proportional Hazard Models were used to estimate sex disparities in AMI incidence within the Dutch majority population and within ethnic minority groups, stratified by age (30-54, 55-64, â‰¥65 years).AMI incidence was higher in men than in women in all groups under study. Compared with the majority population (hazard ratio (HR): 2.23; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 2.21-2.25), sex disparities were similar among minorities originating from the immediate surrounding countries (Belgium, Germany), whereas they were greater in most other minority groups. Most pronounced results were found among minorities from Morocco (HR: 3.48; 95% CI: 2.48-4.88), South Asia (HR: 3.92; 95% CI: 2.45-6.26) and Turkey (HR: 3.98; 95% CI: 3.51-4.51). Sex disparity differences were predominantly evident in those below 55 years of age, and were mainly provoked by a higher AMI incidence in ethnic minority men compared with men belonging to the Dutch majority population.Sex disparities in AMI incidence clearly varied between ethnic minorities and the Dutch majority population. Health prevention strategies may first target at a reduction of AMI incidence in young ethnic minority men, especially those originating from Turkey and South Asia. Furthermore, an increase in AMI incidence in their female counterparts should be prevented."mycardial	MANAG	"Sex disparities in reperfusion therapy for patients with acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction have been documented. However, little is known about whether these patterns exist in the comparison of young women with men.We examined sex differences in rates, types of reperfusion therapy, and proportion of patients exceeding American Heart Association reperfusion time guidelines for ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction in a prospective observational cohort study (2008-2012) of 1465 patients 18 to 55 years of age, as part of the US Variations in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients (VIRGO) study at 103 hospitals enrolling in a 2:1 ratio of women to men. Of the 1238 patients eligible for reperfusion, women were more likely to be untreated than men (9% versus 4%, P=0.002). There was no difference in reperfusion strategy for the 695 women and 458 men treated. Women were more likely to exceed in-hospital and transfer time guidelines for percutaneous coronary intervention than men (41% versus 29%; odds ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.16), more so when transferred (67% versus 44%; odds ratio, 2.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-4.07); and more likely to exceed door-to-needle times (67% versus 37%; odds ratio, 2.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-2.18). After adjustment for sociodemographic, clinical, and organizational factors, sex remained an important factor in exceeding reperfusion guidelines (odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.33).Young women with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction are less likely to receive reperfusion therapy and more likely to have reperfusion delays than similarly aged men. Sex disparities are more pronounced among patients transferred to percutaneous coronary intervention institutions or who received fibrinolytic therapy."mycardial	REVIEW	"The increasing use of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) has improved clinical outcome in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, but the impact of sex on early and mid-term outcomes remains to be defined.Medline, Cochrane Library, Biomed Central, and Google Scholar were searched for articles describing differences in baseline, periprocedural, and midterm outcomes after pPCI, by sex. The primary end point was all-cause mortality at early and mid-term follow-up. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital bleeding and stroke.Sixteen studies were included. Women were older, had more frequent hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia, as well as longer ischemia time and more shock at presentation. Men were more likely to have had a previous myocardial infarction. Female sex emerged as independently associated to early mortality (OR 1.1; 95%CI, 1.02-1.18) but not to mid-term mortality (OR, 1.01; 95%CI, 0.99-1.03). The pooled analysis showed a significantly higher risk of in hospital stroke (OR, 1.69; 95%CI, 1.11-2.56) and major bleeding (OR, 2.04; 95%CI, 1.51-2.77) in women.As compared to men, women undergoing pPCI have more bleedings and strokes, and a worse early, but not mid-term mortality. These findings may allow a better risk stratification of pPCI patients."mycardial	EPI	"Depression was recently recognized as a risk factor for adverse medical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The degree to which depression is present among younger patients with an AMI, the patient profile associated with being a young AMI patient with depressive symptoms, and whether relevant sex differences exist are currently unknown.The Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients (VIRGO) study enrolled 3572 patients with AMI (67.1% women; 2:1 ratio for women to men) between 2008 and 2012 (at 103 hospitals in the United States, 24 in Spain, and 3 in Australia). Information about lifetime history of depression and depressive symptoms experienced over the past 2 weeks (Patient Health Questionnaire; a cutoff score â‰¥10 was used for depression screening) was collected during index AMI admission. Information on demographics, socioeconomic status, cardiovascular risk, AMI severity, perceived stress (14-item Perceived Stress Scale), and health status (Seattle Angina Questionnaire, EuroQoL 5D) was obtained through interviews and chart abstraction. Nearly half (48%) of the women reported a lifetime history of depression versus 1 in 4 in men (24%; P<0.0001). At the time of admission for AMI, more women than men experienced depressive symptoms (39% versus 22%, P<0.0001; adjusted odds ratio 1.64; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.98). Patients with more depressive symptoms had higher levels of stress and worse quality of life (P<0.001). Depressive symptoms were more prevalent among patients with lower socioeconomic profiles (eg, lower education, uninsured) and with more cardiovascular risk factors (eg, diabetes, smoking).A high rate of lifetime history of depression and depressive symptoms at the time of an AMI was observed among younger women compared with men. Depressive symptoms affected those with more vulnerable socioeconomic and clinical profiles."mycardial	REVIEW	"Many factors influence the experience of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the well-being of affected patients; gender differences emerge in the patterns of influence, and women's specificity is frequently highlighted. The purpose of this literature review is exploring in depth the experience of AMI in women.We selected and analyzed 44 articles on five factors strongly affecting women's well-being after AMI: the delay in seeking treatment for symptoms, medical treatment, therapeutic adherence, social support and coping strategies.The studies have attributed gender differences in the delay in seeking care for symptoms partly to a lack of information, but especially to socially built factors, such as the stereotypic belief of cardiac diseases as ""male diseases"". Studies on the medical treatment show that women are less likely to undergo diagnostic tests and clinical treatment compared to men, but women's older age may counterbalance the gender effect. Compared to men, therapeutic adherence appears lower in women, who find lifestyle changes more difficult to achieve; however, women rely more on social support, affecting positively their well-being. Also, women use more emotion-focused, evasive or fatalistic coping strategies; they are likely to minimize the severity of symptoms, to try to control the disease and to protect the significant others from the negative consequences of the infarction.Most studies highlight gender differences in the experience of AMI and in the patterns of influence of the factors we analyzed."mycardial	CLIN	"This study sought to assess inÂ vivo sex differences in the pathophysiology of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and vascular response to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).There is no consensus on whether differences in the pathophysiology of STEMI and response to primary PCI between women and men reflect biological factors as opposed to differences in age.In this prospective, multicenter study, 140 age-matched men and women with STEMI undergoing primary PCI with everolimus-eluting stent were investigated with intravascular optical coherence tomography, histopathology-immunohistochemistry of thrombus aspirates, and serum biomarkers. Primary endpoints were the percentages of culprit plaque rupture at baseline and everolimus-eluting stent strut coverage at 9-month follow-up as determined by optical coherence tomography.Men and women had similar rates of plaque rupture (50.0% vs. 48.4%; risk ratio [RR]: 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73 to 1.47; pÂ = 0.56). Nonruptured/eroded plaques comprised 25% of all cases (pÂ = 0.86 in men vs. women). There were no sex differences in composition of aspirated thrombus and immune and inflammatory serum biomarkers. At 9 months, women had similar strut coverage (90.9% vs. 92.5%; difference in medians: RR: 0.2%; 95% CI: -0.4% to 1.3%; pÂ = 0.89) and amount of in-stent neointimal obstruction (10.3% vs. 10.6%; pÂ = 0.76) as men did. There were no sex differences in clinical outcome either at 30-day or 1-year follow-up."mycardial	CLIN	"Measurement of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin levels is increasingly used in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). However, studies investigating the distribution and prognostic implications of high-sensitivity troponin levels in men and women separately are currently lacking.Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels were determined using a high-sensitivity assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) in 1,677 male and 1,073 female NSTE-ACS patients participating in the GUSTO IV study. The prognostic associations of cTnI to outcome (30-day composite end point of recurrent myocardial infarction and 1-year mortality) were assessed in multivariable models, using cTnI both as a continuous variable and dichotomized at different sets of single and gender-specific 99th percentiles.Median cTnI levels were 947 and 175 ng/L in men and women, respectively (P < .001). The adjusted odds ratios for cTnI (ln) were similar in men and women. The adjusted odds ratios for cTnI above the tested 99th percentiles levels in contrast were twice as high in women compared with men. This was a consequence of differences in the cTnI distribution and risk gradients across cTnI levels, in particular due to lower event rates in women without cTnI elevation. Gender-specific cutoffs did not improve risk prediction.Despite overall lower levels, cTnI above the tested 99th percentiles exhibited stronger prognostic information in women with NSTE-ACS compared with men. This likely reflects differences in the pathophysiology and the clinical presentation in NSTE-ACS. Our data, thus, emphasize that women with symptoms of unstable coronary artery disease encompass a broader risk panorama than men."mycardial	OUTC	"Social support is an important predictor of health outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but social support varies by sex and age. Differences in social support could account for sex differences in outcomes of young patients with AMI.Data from the Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients (VIRGO) study, an observational study of AMI patients aged â‰¤55 years in the United States and Spain, were used for this study. Patients were categorized as having low versus moderate/high perceived social support using the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory. Outcomes included health status (Short Form-12 physical and mental component scores), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire), and angina-related quality of life (Seattle Angina Questionnaire) evaluated at baseline and 12 months. Among 3432 patients, 21.2% were classified as having low social support. Men and women had comparable levels of social support at baseline. On average, patients with low social support reported lower functional status and quality of life and more depressive symptoms at baseline and 12 months post-AMI. After multivariable adjustment, including baseline health status, low social support was associated with lower mental functioning, lower quality of life, and more depressive symptoms at 12 months (all P<0.001). The relationship between low social support and worse physical functioning was nonsignificant after adjustment (P=0.6). No interactions were observed between social support, sex, or country.Lower social support is associated with worse health status and more depressive symptoms 12 months after AMI in both young men and women. Sex did not modify the effect of social support."mycardial	EPI	"To examine psychological risk factors and somatic factors in patients after myocardial infarction. To study the relationship between somatic and psychological factors, their influence on subjective quality of life (well-being) and also to examine possible gender differences.There has been a growing body of evidence that psychosocial factors are risk factors for incident and recurrent myocardial infarction.Descriptive correlational and cross-sectional survey design.In patients (n = 97, 67 men), the level of depression and anxiety, vital exhaustion, sleep disturbances and well-being were assessed. Left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular diastolic diameter, body mass index, metabolic equivalents and the number of diseased vessels were retrieved from medical records.Anxiety, vital exhaustion and sleep disturbances were significantly higher in women than in men. Well-being showed a significant linear correlation with body mass index, anxiety, depression, vital exhaustion and sleep disturbances scores. After adjustment for psychological risk factors and somatic parameters, only vital exhaustion and anxiety correlated significantly with well-being. However, there were gender differences in predictive variables of well-being. Anxiety in men and vital exhaustion in women showed a linear correlation with the subjective quality of life.Our study revealed that only vital exhaustion and anxiety showed a significant correlation with well-being in patients.During cardiac rehabilitation, it is important to detect and treat not only depression but also vital exhaustion and anxiety, because by reducing these psychological conditions, we can improve well-being."mycardial	PP	"It is well established that the incidence and infarct size in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is subject to circadian variations. At the molecular level, circadian clocks in distinct cells, including cardiomyocytes, generate 24-h cycles of biochemical processes. Possible imbalance or impairment in the cell clock mechanism may alter the cardiac metabolism and function and increase the susceptibility of cardiovascular diseases. One of the key components of the human clock system PERIOD3 (PER3) has been recently demonstrated to affect circadian expression of various genes in different tissues, including the heart. The variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism (rs57875989) in gene Period3 (Per3) is related to multiple phenotypic parameters, including diurnal preference, sleep homeostasis, infection and cancer. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of this polymorphism in AMI with ST elevation (STEMI). The study subjects (314 patients of Caucasian origin with STEMI, and 332 healthy controls) were genotyped for Per3 VNTR polymorphism using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. A gender difference in circadian rhythmicity of pain onset was observed with significant circadian pattern in men. Furthermore, the Per3(5/5) variant carriers were associated with higher levels of interleukin-6, B-type natriuretic peptide and lower vitamin A levels. By using cosinor analysis we observed different circadian distribution patterns of AMI onset at the level of genotype and allelic frequencies. Genotypes with at least one 4-repeat allele (Per3(4/5) and Per3(4/4)) (N = 264) showed remarkable circadian activity in comparison with Per3(5/5) (N = 50), especially in men. No significant differences in genotype and/or allele frequencies of Per3 VNTR polymorphism were observed when comparing STEMI cases and controls. Our results indicate that the Per3 VNTR may contribute to modulation of cardiac functions and interindividual differences in development and progression of myocardial infarction."mycardial	OUTC	"Women have unfavorable prognosis after myocardial infarction (MI). This text describes sex differences in mortality and in the power of risk predictors in contemporarily-treated MI patients.A population of 4141 MI patients (26.5% females) was followed up for 5years. Effects of sex and age on total mortality were investigated by multivariable Cox analysis. Mortality predictors were investigated by receiver-operator characteristics analysis. Stepwise multivariable Cox regression was used to create sex-specific predictive models.Thirty-day mortality was 1.5-fold higher in women. However, sex was not a significant mortality predictor in a model adjusted for age. Predictors for 5-year mortality performed differently in male and female patients. In women, a sex-specific model provided better risk stratification than a sex-neutral model.The unfavorable prognosis of female MI patients can be explained by advanced age. Sex-specific predictive models might improve risk stratification in female survivors of acute MI."mycardial	CLIN	"It was not understood whether age- and sex-related differences were apparent in lipid profiles among acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients in China.To investigate lipid abnormalities in such AMI patients.A retrospective analysis of 1213 patients hospitalized with a first AMI between May 2007 and JulyÂ 2011.Our data indicated that, compared with the elderly, the nonelderly tended to have higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (N-HDL) for both males and females. There was significant difference in LDL among various age groups (PÂ <Â .001): LDL levels in the 50-59 and 60-69 year age groups were higher than those in 70-79 and 80-89 year age groups. Compared with males, females tended to have higher LDL in both the 50-59 and 60-69 year age groups. There was no difference in HDL among various age groups for female AMI patients, but there was significance for males. Compared with males, females had higher HDL in 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70-79 year age groups, respectively. Among various age groups, there was significant difference in triglycerides (TG) for male AMI patients, but no difference in TG for females. The levels of TG were higher in 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69 year age groups than those in 70-79, 80-89, and â‰¥90 year age groups, respectively, for males. Isolated low HDL (low HDLÂ +Â normal LDLÂ +Â normal TG) was the most common type of combined dyslipidemia for male elderly (31.4%), male nonelderly (22.9%), and female elderly (19.2%) patients.We concluded that there was age- and sex-related difference in lipid profiles among AMI patients, with more prevalent dyslipidemia in the nonelderly than the elderly. Perimenopausal women were prone to higher LDL, and low HDL was prevalent among AMI patients in East China."mycardial	MANAG	"Little is known regarding gender differences in left ventricular (LV) function after anterior wall ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), despite it being a major determinant of patients' morbidity and mortality. We therefore sought to investigate the impact of gender on LV function after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for first anterior wall STEMI. Seven hundred eighty-nine consecutive patients (625 men) with first anterior STEMI were included in the analysis. All patients underwent an echocardiographic study within 48 hours of PCI. Women were older and more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal failure, and a higher Killip score. Women had prolonged ischemic time, which was driven by prolonged symptom-to-presentation time (2.75 [interquartile range 1.5 to 4] vs 2 [interquartile range 1 to 3.5] hours, p = 0.005). A higher percentage of women had moderate or worse LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction <40%; 61.6% vs 48%, p = 0.002). In a univariable analysis female gender was associated with moderate or worse LV function (p = 0.002). However, after accounting for variable baseline risk profiles between the 2 groups using multivariable and propensity score techniques, ischemic time >3.5 hours, leukocytosis, and pre-PCI Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade <2 were independent predictors of moderate or worse LV dysfunction, whereas female gender was not. Data on LV function recovery at 6 months, which were available for 45% of female and male patients with moderate or worse LV dysfunction early after PCI, showed no significant gender related difference in LV function recovery. In conclusion, women undergoing PCI for the first event of anterior STEMI demonstrate worse LV function than that of men, which might be partially attributed to delay in presentation. Hence greater efforts should be devoted to increasing women's awareness of cardiac symptoms during the prehospital course of STEMI."mycardial	REVIEW	"Although outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have improved in the past 2 decades, a sex disparity exists in survival, with women having higher mortality than men.To conduct a meta-analysis of observational studies that examined differences in mortality by sex in patients with STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane central, and electronic databases were searched for relevant studies in all languages and without time restriction.Studies were included if (1) they studied patients who presented with STEMI, (2) primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) was the treatment for STEMI, (3) PPCI was performed within 12 hours of symptom onset, and (4) sex-specific in-hospital and/or 1-year mortality were reported.Two investigators independently reviewed retrieved citations and assessed eligibility. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Quality of included studies was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.Sex-specific in-hospital and 1-year all-cause mortality. Risk ratios (RRs) of mortality were used for these 2 time points, if reported.Of the 149 studies identified, 35 met inclusion criteria, representing 18â€‰555 women and 49â€‰981 men. In the unadjusted analyses, women were at a higher risk for in-hospital (RR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.75-2.14 [Pâ€‰<â€‰.001, I2â€‰=â€‰14%]) and 1-year all-cause mortality (RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.36-1.84 [Pâ€‰<â€‰.001, I2â€‰=â€‰51%]) compared with men. However, when adjusted RRs were used, the association between women and higher risk of all-cause mortality was attenuated but still significantly elevated for in-hospital mortality (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.07-2.05 [Pâ€‰=â€‰.02, I2â€‰=â€‰56%]), but the higher risk for 1-year mortality in women was no longer significant (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.69-1.17 [Pâ€‰=â€‰.42, I2â€‰=â€‰58%]).An increased mortality in women with STEMI treated with PPCI was detected in this large meta-analysis but is likely confounded by baseline cardiovascular risk factors and the differences in clinical profile of male and female patients with STEMI. Intensive cardiovascular risk modification efforts in women may help to reduce this sex disparity."mycardial	EPI	"To determine the clinical outcomes of women and men with nonobstructive coronary artery disease ( CAD coronary artery disease ) with coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography data in patients who were similar in terms of CAD coronary artery disease risk factors, angina typicality, and CAD coronary artery disease extent and distribution.Institutional review board approval was obtained for all participating sites, with either informed consent or waiver of informed consent. In a prospective international multicenter cohort study of 27 125 patients undergoing coronary CT angiography at 12 centers, 18 158 patients with no CAD coronary artery disease or nonobstructive (<50% stenosis) CAD coronary artery disease were examined. Men and women were propensity matched for age, CAD coronary artery disease risk factors, angina typicality, and CAD coronary artery disease extent and distribution, which resulted in a final cohort of 11 462 subjects. Nonobstructive CAD coronary artery disease presence and extent were related to incident major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE major adverse cardiovascular events ), which were inclusive of death and myocardial infarction and were estimated by using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.At a mean follow-up Â± standard deviation of 2.3 years Â± 1.1, MACE major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 164 patients (0.6% annual event rate). After matching, women and men experienced identical annualized rates of myocardial infarction (0.2% vs 0.2%, P = .72), death (0.5% vs 0.5%, P = .98), and MACE major adverse cardiovascular events (0.6% vs 0.6%, P = .94). In multivariable analysis, nonobstructive CAD coronary artery disease was associated with similarly increased MACE major adverse cardiovascular events for both women (hazard ratio: 1.96 [95% confidence interval { CI confidence interval }: 1.17, 3.28], P = .01) and men (hazard ratio: 1.77 [95% CI confidence interval : 1.07, 2.93], P = .03).When matched for age, CAD coronary artery disease risk factors, angina typicality, and nonobstructive CAD coronary artery disease extent, women and men experience comparable rates of incident mortality and myocardial infarction."mycardial	CLIN	"International recommendations highlight the superior value of cardiac troponins (cTns) for early diagnosis of myocardial infarction along with analytical requirements of improved precision and detectability. In this multicenter study, we investigated the analytical performance of a new high sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay and its 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL).Laboratories from nine European countries evaluated the ARCHITECT STAT high sensitive troponin I (hs-TnI) immunoassay on the ARCHITECT i2000SR/i1000SR immunoanalyzers. Imprecision, limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), limit of quantitation (LoQ) linearity of dilution, interferences, sample type, method comparisons, and 99th percentile URLs were evaluated in this study.Total imprecision of 3.3%-8.9%, 2.0%-3.5% and 1.5%-5.2% was determined for the low, medium and high controls, respectively. The lowest cTnI concentration corresponding to a total CV of 10% was 5.6 ng/L. Common interferences, sample dilution and carryover did not affect the hs-cTnI results. Slight, but statistically significant, differences with sample type were found. Concordance between the investigated hs-cTnI assay and contemporary cTnI assay at 99th percentile cut-off was found to be 95%. TnI was detectable in 75% and 57% of the apparently healthy population using the lower (1.1 ng/L) and upper (1.9 ng/L) limit of the LoD range provided by the ARCHITECT STAT hs-TnI package insert, respectively. The 99th percentile values were gender dependent.The new ARCHITECT STAT hs-TnI assay with improved analytical features meets the criteria of high sensitive Tn test and will be a valuable diagnostic tool."mycardial	MANAG	"Conflicting data on sex-based differences in outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) among Western population exist. Little is known about the nature of sex-specific PCI outcomes in an Asian population.We performed a pooled analysis using 23,604 patients from 11 prospective PCI clinical studies performed in Korea. The primary outcome was a major cardiovascular event, defined as composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, or stroke. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and target vessel revascularization.Thirty-day and 2-year rates of major cardiovascular events were more frequent in women than in men, mainly because of a higher incidence of periprocedural myocardial infarction in women (30-day: 9.2% vs 7.1%; 2-year: 11.2% vs 8.9%). After multivariable adjustment, women had significantly higher risks of 30-day (hazard ratio [HR] 1.27, 95% CI 1.19-1.36) and 2-year major cardiovascular events (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.30). Unadjusted 30-day and 2-year all-cause mortality was similar between women and men (30-day: 0.5% vs 0.4%; 2-year: 2.8% vs 2.8%). However, after multivariable adjustment, women had a lower adjusted risk of 2-year death (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77-0.87). No sex-based difference was observed for target vessel revascularization (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91-1.25). Overall, sex-specific findings for outcomes were consistent across multiple patient subgroups.Among Korean population undergoing contemporary PCI, women have a significantly higher risk of short- and long-term major cardiovascular events than do men but have better long-term survival."mycardial	MANAG	"Gender differences in presentation, management and outcome in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have been reported.To determine whether female gender is associated with higher inhospital mortality.Data from ORBI, a regional STEMI registry of 5 years' standing, were analysed. The main data on presentation, management, inhospital outcome and prescription at discharge were compared between genders. Various adjusted hazard ratios were then calculated for inhospital mortality (women versus men).The analysis included 5000 patients (mean age 62.6Â±13 years), with 1174 women (23.5%). Women were on average 8 years older than men, with more frequent co-morbidities. Median ischaemia time was 215 minutes (26 minutes longer in women; P<0.05). Reperfusion strategies in women less frequently involved fibrinolysis, coronary angiography, radial access and thrombo-aspiration. Female gender, especially in patients aged<60 years, was associated with poorer inhospital prognosis (including higher inhospital mortality: 9% vs. 4% in men; P<0.0001), and underutilization of recommended treatments at discharge. Moreover, excess female inhospital mortality was independent of presentation, revascularization time and reperfusion strategy (hazard ratio for women 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.76; P=0.04).One in four patients admitted for STEMI was female, with significant differences in presentation. Female gender was associated with less-optimal treatment, both in the acute-phase and at discharge. Efforts should be made to reduce these differences, especially as female gender was independently associated with an elevated risk of inhospital mortality."mycardial	OUTC	"Previous data reported worse outcomes in female patients after acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), related at least in part to less aggressive and nonparallel treatment. We investigated the presence of gender differences in left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in patients presenting with first STEMI, treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Study population included 187 consecutive patients (81% men) presenting with STEMI and treated by primary PCI and guideline-based medications. Their mean age was 58 Â± 10 years. All patients underwent a comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation within 3 days of admission. Female patients were older (62 Â± 11 vs 59 Â± 10 years, p = 0.006), with more co-morbidities and longer symptom duration (490 Â± 436 vs 365 Â± 437 minutes, p = 0.013). Echocardiography demonstrated that female patients had significantly lower LV systolic function (47 Â± 8% vs 45 Â± 8%, p = 0.03), lower septal and lateral e' velocities, higher average E/e' ratio (all p <0.001), elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (p = 0.03), and worse diastolic dysfunction (p = 0.007). No significant changes were present in left atrial volumes. In a logistic multivariate analysis model, female gender emerged as an independent predictor of septal e' <8 cm/s (odds ratio 10.11, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 82.32, p = 0.002) and E/average e' ratio >15 (odds ratio 6.47, 95% confidence interval 1.63 to 25.61, p = 0.008). In conclusion, female patients undergoing primary PCI for first STEMI demonstrated worse systolic and diastolic LV function, despite receiving similar treatment as male patients."mycardial	OUTC	"Various national campaigns launched in recent years have focused on young women with acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs). Contemporary longitudinal data about sex differences in clinical characteristics, hospitalization rates, length of stay (LOS), and mortality have not been examined.This study sought to determine sex differences in clinical characteristics, hospitalization rates, LOS, and in-hospital mortality by age group and race among young patients with AMIs using a large national dataset of U.S. hospital discharges.Using the National Inpatient Sample, clinical characteristics, AMI hospitalization rates, LOS, and in-hospital mortality were compared for patients with AMI across ages 30 to 54 years, dividing them into 5-year subgroups from 2001 to 2010, using survey data analysis techniques.A total of 230,684 hospitalizations were identified with principal discharge diagnoses of AMI in 30- to 54-year-old patients from Nationwide Inpatient Sample data, representing an estimated 1,129,949 hospitalizations in the United States from 2001 to 2010. No statistically significant declines in AMI hospitalization rates were observed in the age groups <55 years or stratified by sex. Prevalence of comorbidities was higher in women and increased among both sexes through the study period. Women had longer LOS and higher in-hospital mortality than men across all age groups. However, observed in-hospital mortality declined significantly for women from 2001 to 2010 (from 3.3% to 2.3%, relative change 30.5%; p for trend < 0.0001) but not for men (from 2% to 1.8%, relative change 8.6%; p for trend = 0.60).AMI hospitalization rates for young people have not declined over the past decade. Young women with AMIs have more comorbidity, longer LOS, and higher in-hospital mortality than young men, although their mortality rates are decreasing."mycardial	REVIEW	"This review aims to provide new insights into the basis for sex differences in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Sex differences in mortality after ACS depend on age and the type of ACS, with the greatest gap being observed among younger adults and patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The sex gap diminishes with increasing age and does not appear to exist to the same extent among patients with non-STEMI or unstable angina. Although it is clear that younger women with acute myocardial infarction have higher mortality than do men in the short term; whether this difference is present in the long term remains unclear. Furthermore, women with ACS face delays in diagnosis and treatment, undergo less invasive management, have more bleeding complications, and receive less evidence-based medical therapy than do their male counterparts. Finally, women with ACS consistently report lower health-related quality of life than do men. To date, our understanding of the sex differences in ACS remains limited. The impact of biological factors and nonbiological factors (especially gender roles) need to be explored to elucidate the disparities in health outcomes between men and women. "mycardial	OUTC	"Recent research has identified younger women as an ""at-risk"" population with rising prevalence of cardiac risk factors and excess mortality risk following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, population-based data on trends in AMI hospitalization and early mortality post AMI among younger adults is scarce. We, therefore, aimed to provide a 10-year, descriptive analysis of these trends in a Canadian setting.We assessed trends and sex differences in AMI hospitalization and 30-day mortality rates using negative binomial and logistic regression, respectively. From 2000 to 2009, there were 70,628 AMI hospitalizations in adults aged â‰¥20 years, in British Columbia, Canada, with 17.1% of cohort being younger adults â‰¤55 years. Overall, age-standardized AMI rates (per 100,000 population) declined similarly in men (295.8 to 247.7) and women (152.1 to 128.8) [sex-year interaction p=0.81]. However, these trends differed according to age (age-sex-year interaction p=0.02) with increased rates observed only in younger women (+1.7% per year; p=0.04). The 30-day mortality rates declined similarly for women (19.4% to 13.9%) and men (13.0% to 9.3%) (sex-year interaction p=0.33). Yet, younger women continued to have excess mortality risk, compared with younger men, even in the most recent period [odds ratio: (2008-09)=1.61 (95% onfidence interval: 1.25, 2.08)].While the overall AMI hospitalization and 30-day mortality rates significantly declined in women and men, hospitalization rates in women â‰¤55 years increased and their excess risk of 30-day mortality persisted. These findings highlight the need to intensify strategies to reduce the incidence of AMI and improve outcomes after AMI in younger women."mycardial	CLIN	"Significant gender differences in angiographic severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) have been demonstrated among patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). However, it is unknown if these gender differences are reflected in the extent of myocardial ischemia.We assessed segmental myocardial wall motion and perfusion by contrast echocardiography in 110 patients (34 women and 76 men) with NSTEMI prior to scheduled coronary angiography. The extent of myocardial ischemia using a 17-segment left ventricular (LV) model was compared to quantitative coronary angiography (QCA).Age (70â€‰Â±â€‰12 vs 66â€‰Â±â€‰12 years), troponin T level (0.53â€‰Â±â€‰0.66 vs 0.75â€‰Â±â€‰1.32â€‰Âµg/l), Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score (3.2â€‰Â±â€‰1.4 vs 3.5â€‰Â±â€‰1.4), LV ejection fraction and cardiovascular risk factor burden did not differ between genders. As expected, women had less severe findings on coronary angiography but the extent of myocardial ischemia by contrast echocardiography was comparable in women and men. In multivariable analysis, the risk of having prognostically severe angiographic CAD increased by 29% in women and by 49% in men for every additional LV segment with ischemia, independent of TIMI risk score (both pâ€‰<â€‰0.01).The present contrast echocardiography study in NSTEMI patients demonstrates that women with NSTEMI have the same extent of LV myocardial ischemia as men in spite of less prevalent angiographic CAD. The findings may help explain why less severe angiographic findings in women with NSTEMI are not accompanied by lower mortality."mycardial	OUTC	"To analyze sex-based differences in clinical characteristics, management, and 28-day and 7-year prognosis after a first myocardial infarction.Between 2001 and 2003, 2042 first myocardial infarction patients were consecutively registered in 6 Spanish hospitals. Clinical characteristics, management, and 28-day case-fatality were prospectively recorded. Seven-year vital status was also ascertained by data linkage with the National Mortality Index.The registry included 449 women and 1593 men with a first myocardial infarction. Compared with men, women were older, had a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, and were more likely to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors but were less likely to receive beta-blockers or thrombolysis. No differences were observed in use of invasive procedures. More women had non-ST-segment elevation and unclassified myocardial infarction than men (37.9% vs 31.3% and 9.8% vs 6.1%, respectively; both P<.001). Case-fatality at 28 days was similar in women and men (5.57% vs 4.46%; P=.39). After multivariate adjustment, the odds ratio of 28-day mortality for men was 1.06 (95% confidence interval: 0.49-2.27; P=.883) compared with women. After multivariate adjustment, men had higher 7-year mortality than women, hazard ratio 1.93 (95% confidence interval: 1.46-2.56; P<.001).There are demographic and clinical differences between men and women with a first myocardial infarction. The short-term prognosis of a first myocardial infarction in this century is similar in both sexes. However, the long-term vital prognosis after a first myocardial infarction is worse in men than in women. These results are observed in both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction events."mycardial	MANAG	"It is unclear whether gender and racial/ethnic gaps in the use of and patient adherence to Î²-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins after acute myocardial infarction have persisted after establishment of the Medicare Part D prescription program.This retrospective cohort study used 2007 to 2009 Medicare service claims among Medicare beneficiaries â‰¥65 years of age who were alive 30 days after an index acute myocardial infarction hospitalization in 2008. Multivariable logistic regression models examined racial/ethnic (white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and other) and gender differences in the use of these therapies in the 30 days after discharge and patient adherence at 12 months after discharge, adjusting for patient baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Of 85 017 individuals, 55%, 76%, and 61% used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, Î²-blockers, and statins, respectively, within 30 days after discharge. No marked differences in use were found by race/ethnicity, but women were less likely to use angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and Î²-blockers compared with men. However, at 12 months after discharge, compared with white men, black and Hispanic women had the lowest likelihood (â‰ˆ30%-36% lower; P<0.05) of being adherent, followed by white, Asian, and other women and black and Hispanic men (â‰ˆ9%-27% lower; P<0.05). No significant difference was shown between Asian/other men and white men.Although minorities were initially no less likely to use the therapies after acute myocardial infarction discharge compared with white patients, black and Hispanic patients had significantly lower adherence over 12 months. Strategies to address gender and racial/ethnic gaps in the elderly are needed."mycardial	PP	"Age-specific incidence of ischemic heart disease in men is higher than in women, although women die more frequently without previous symptoms; the molecular mechanism(s) are poorly understood. Most studies focus on protection by estrogen, with less attention on androgen receptor-mediated androgen actions. Our aim was to determine the role of androgens in the sex differences in cardiac damage during myocardial infarction. Mature age-matched male and female Sprague Dawley rats, intact or surgically gonadectomized (Gx), received testosterone (T) or 17Î²-estradiol (E2) via subdermal SILASTIC (Dow Corning Corp.) implants; a subset of male rats received dihydrotestosterone. After 21 days, animals were anesthetized, and hearts were excised and subjected to ex vivo regional ischemia-reperfusion (I-R). Hearts from intact males had larger infarcts than those from females following I-R; Gx produced the opposite effect, confirming a role for sex steroids. In Gx males, androgens (dihydrotestosterone, T) and E2 aggravated I-R-induced cardiac damage, whereas in Gx females, T had no effect and E2 reduced infarct area. Increased circulating T levels up-regulated androgen receptor and receptor for advanced glycation end products, which resulted in enhanced apoptosis aggravating cardiac damage in both males and females. In conclusion, our study demonstrates, for the first time, that sex steroids regulate autophagy during myocardial infarction and shows that a novel mechanism of action for androgens during I-R is down-regulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL (B cell lymphoma-extra large), a key controller for cross talk between autophagy and apoptosis, shifting the balance toward apoptosis and leading to aggravated cardiac damage.

Women remain underrepresented in published trial literature relative to their disease prevalence. Strong evidence do exists demonstrating gender differences in efficacy (ischemic risk) and safety (bleeding risk) associated with antithrombotic treatment, mostly related to different values of body mass, and renal function in women than men. Several data show a higher platelet reactivity in females and a higher prevalence of high platelet reactivity on aspirin and clopidogrel therapy. In primary prevention, the use of aspirin is associated with a higher reduction of risk for ischemic stroke in females and for myocardial infarction in males. In the setting of ACS, female gender is associated with a significantly higher risk of bleeding. In summary, there are some gender-related aspects of guidance in the complex spectrum of the net clinical benefit related to antithrombotic treatment. "mycardial	MANAG	"Mortality due to coronary heart disease has been declining as a result of better clinical patient management, including secondary prevention with the aid of effective drugs. The clinical challenge remains how to improve adherence to evidence-based cardiac care for all patients who can benefit from it. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of drug use after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in reducing total medium-term mortality and to establish whether there are disparities in prescribing all therapies of demonstrated effectiveness.We conducted a retrospective cohort study between 2002 and 2009 using a record linkage database, considering 1327 patients discharged after AMI.Cox's regression models were used for the survival analysis with time-dependent variables. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the inequalities in the actual use of therapies found significantly associated with a lower mortality in the survival analyses.Therapies independently associated with a lower all-cause mortality risk were antiplatelet drugs, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins. Gender-related differences in prescriptions were seen for statins and antiplatelet drugs; age-related differences emerged for all drugs. Associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reduced the likelihood of patients taking the effective treatments.The present study revealed disparities in the use of treatments for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease unjustifiable on the strength of clinical evidence."mycardial	MANAG	"United States and European cardiovascular society guidelines recommend physicians counsel patients about resuming sexual activity after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but little is known about patients' experience with counseling about sexual activity after AMI.The prospective, longitudinal Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients (VIRGO) study, conducted at 127 hospitals in the United States and Spain, was designed, in part, to evaluate gender differences in baseline sexual activity, function, and patient experience with physician counseling about sexual activity after an AMI. This study used baseline and 1-month data collected from the 2:1 sample of women (N=2349) and men (N=1152) ages 18 to 55 years with AMI. Median age was 48 years. Among those who reported discussing sexual activity with a physician in the month after AMI (12% of women, 19% of men), 68% were given restrictions: limit sex (35%), take a more passive role (26%), and/or keep the heart rate down (23%). In risk-adjusted analyses, factors associated with not discussing sexual activity with a physician included female gender (relative risk, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.11), age (relative risk, 1.05 per 10 years; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.08), and sexual inactivity at baseline (relative risk, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.15). Among patients who received counseling, women in Spain were significantly more likely to be given restrictions than U.S. women (relative risk; 1.36, 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.66).Very few patients reported counseling for sexual activity after AMI. Those who did were commonly given restrictions not supported by evidence or guidelines."mycardial	MANAG	"Sex differences in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have been well studied in major registries and clinical trials in Western populations. Limited studies have examined the sex differences in ACS using a large number of Asian women as the subjects.The aim was to study the sex differences in ACS using the NCVD-ACS (National Cardiovascular Disease Database-Acute Coronary Syndrome) registry.We analyzed 13,591 ACS patients, of which 75.8% were men and 24.2% were women, from March 2006 to February 2010. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, risk factors, anthropometrics, treatments, procedures, mortalities, and complications. The results were compared among 3 cohorts of ACS (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], non-STEMI, and unstable angina).Women were older and more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, previous heart failure, and cerebral vascular accidents than men were. Women were less likely to receive in-hospital administration of aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers, and they were less likely to undergo angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. In STEMI, a significantly lower proportion of women than men received primary percutaneous coronary intervention (6.2% vs. 6.7%, respectively, pÂ = 0.000) and fibrinolysis (64.4% vs. 74.6%, respectively, pÂ = 0.000). In addition, with regard to STEMI, women had a significantly higher unadjusted in-hospital mortality rate than men did (15.0% vs. 8.1%, respectively, p < 0.000). There was no statistically significant in-hospital mortality difference between sexes for non-STEMI and unstable angina. After adjustment for age and other covariates, a multivariate analysis showed no sex differences in the in-hospital mortality in all spectrums of ACS.Our study showed significant sex differences in the demographic characteristics, risk factors, treatments, and outcomes of ACS. More importantly, in ACS patients, we found evidence of suboptimal treatments and interventions in women versus men. Our findings provide an opportunity to narrow the sex gap in the care of women with ACS in Malaysia."mycardial	REVIEW	"Studies of sex differences in long-term mortality after acute myocardial infarction have reported mixed results. A systematic review is needed to characterize what is known about sex differences in long-term outcomes and to define gaps in knowledge.We searched the Medline database from 1966 to December 2012 to identify all studies that provided sex-based comparisons of mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Only studies with at least 5 years of follow-up were reviewed. Of the 1877 identified abstracts, 52 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 39 were included in this review. Most studies included fewer than one-third women. There was significant heterogeneity across studies in patient populations, methodology, and risk adjustment, which produced substantial variability in risk estimates. In general, most studies reported higher unadjusted mortality for women compared with men at both 5 and 10 years after acute myocardial infarction; however, many of the differences in mortality became attenuated after adjustment for age. Multivariable models varied between studies; however, most reported a further reduction in sex differences after adjustment for covariates other than age. Few studies examined sex-by-age interactions; however, several studies reported interactions between sex and treatment whereby women have similar mortality risk as men after revascularization.Sex differences in long-term mortality after acute myocardial infarction are largely explained by differences in age, comorbidities, and treatment use between women and men. Future research should aim to clarify how these differences in risk factors and presentation contribute to the sex gap in mortality."mycardial	OUTC	"The aim of this study was to assess recent trends in hospital mortality and in the treatment techniques for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction according to gender. Data on hospitalizations for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction from 2000 to 2010 were extracted from hospital discharge record databases (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes) in the Lombardy Region of Italy. The impact of female gender on in-hospital mortality was assessed by multivariable regression after adjusting for invasive approach use (i.e., coronary angiography, angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft), age, and co-morbidities. A total of 89,562 patients, men (66.5%) and women (33.5%), were enrolled. The use of an invasive approach increased over time in both sexes although it was higher in men (from 54.9% in 2000 to 91.9% in 2010 in men; from 36.8% in 2000 to 72.0% in 2010 in women). This pattern was driven by the subgroup of patients aged â‰¥75Â years, whereas differences between sexes were not observed in patients <65Â years and were small in patients aged 65 to 74Â years. In-hospital mortality presented a small decrease from 7.6% in 2000 to 6.2% in 2010 in men (p for trend = 0.004), whereas it remained higher and substantially constant over time in women (16.6% in 2000, 15.5% in 2010, p for trend = 0.09). At multivariable regression, female gender did not emerge as an independent predictor of mortality (pÂ = 0.13). However, a significant gender-age interaction was found, with female gender being a significant predictor of increased mortality in patients aged â‰¥75Â years (odds ratio [OR] 1.33) while predicting a reduced mortality in patients aged <75Â years (OR 0.93, p for interaction <0.0001). The use of an invasive approach was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 0.23, p <0.0001), the magnitude of mortality reduction being higher in men than in women and in patients aged <75Â years than in those aged â‰¥75Â years. In conclusion, a weak temporal trend in mortality reduction is observed in men only, which is driven by patientsÂ aged â‰¥75Â years. In-hospital mortality remains higher in women than in men, although female gender is not a significant predictor of mortality. Despite temporal increases in the use of an invasive approach, women are more often treated conservatively. "mycardial	PP	"Gender can influence post-infarction cardiac remodeling.To evaluate whether gender influences left ventricular (LV) remodeling and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) after myocardial infarction (MI).Female and male Wistar rats were assigned to one of three groups: sham, moderate MI (size: 20-39% of LV area), and large MI (size: â‰¥40% of LV area). MI was induced by coronary occlusion, and echocardiographic analysis was performed after six weeks to evaluate MI size as well as LV morphology and function. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot were used to quantify ILK in the myocardium.MI size was similar between genders. MI resulted in systolic dysfunction and enlargement of end-diastolic as well as end-systolic dimension of LV as a function of necrotic area size in both genders. Female rats with large MI showed a lower diastolic and systolic dilatation than the respective male rats; however, LV dysfunction was similar between genders. Gene and protein levels of ILK were increased in female rats with moderate and large infarctions, but only male rats with large infarctions showed an altered ILK mRNA level. A negative linear correlation was evident between LV dimensions and ILK expression in female rats with large MI.Post-MI ILK expression is altered in a gender-specific manner, and higher ILK levels found in females may be sufficient to improve LV geometry but not LV function."mycardial	OUTC	"Case-fatality rates in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have significantly decreased; however, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM), a risk factor for AMI, has increased. The purposes of the present study were to assess the prevalence and clinical impact of DM among patients hospitalized with AMI and to estimate the impact of important clinical characteristics associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI and DM.We used the National Inpatient Sample to estimate trends in DM prevalence and in-hospital mortality among 1.5 million patients with AMI from 2000 to 2010, using survey data-analysis methods. Clinical characteristics associated with in-hospital mortality were identified using multivariable logistic regression. There was a significant increase in DM prevalence among AMI patients (year 2000, 22.2%; year 2010, 29.6%, Ptrend<0.0001). AMI patients with DM tended to be older and female and to have more cardiovascular risk factors. However, age-standardized mortality decreased significantly from 2000 (8.48%) to 2010 (4.95%) (Ptrend<0.0001). DM remained independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.069, 95% CI 1.051 to 1.087; P<0.0001). The adverse impact of DM on in-hospital mortality was unchanged over time. Decreased death risk over time was greatest among women and elderly patients. Among younger patients of both sexes, there was a leveling off of this decrease in more recent years.Despite increasing DM prevalence and disease burden among AMI patients, in-hospital mortality declined significantly from 2000 to 2010. The adverse impact of DM on mortality remained unchanged overall over time but was age and sex dependent."mycardial	REVIEW	"High-sensitivity troponin (hsTn) assays are used clinically in most parts of the world and are expected to be approved by the US FDA for clinical use in the USA soon. Clinical use of hsTn leads to improvements in the detection of myocardial injury, shorter time to ruling out acute myocardial infarction, improved risk-stratification of patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation among others. HsTn may also guide strategies for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, unmet challenges remain, including distinguishing between acute and chronic hsTn elevations, distinguishing between type 1 and type 2 acute myocardial infarction and determining whether to use gender-neutral or gender-specific reference values.

We aimed to assess sex-related differences in access to care among patients with premature acute coronary syndrome and to identify clinical and gender-related determinants of access to care.We studied 1123 patients (18-55 yr) admitted to hospital for acute coronary syndrome and enrolled in the GENESIS-PRAXY cohort study. Outcome measures were door-to-electrocardiography, door-to-needle and door-to-balloon times, as well as proportions of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, reperfusion or nonprimary percutaneous coronary intervention. We performed univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify clinical and gender-related determinants of timely procedures and use of invasive procedures.Women were less likely than men to receive care within benchmark times for electrocardiography (â‰¤ 10 min: 29% v. 38%, p = 0.02) or fibrinolysis (â‰¤ 30 min: 32% v. 57%, p = 0.01). Women with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) were less likely than men to undergo reperfusion therapy (primary percutaneous coronary intervention or fibrinolysis) (83% v. 91%, p = 0.01), and women with non-ST-segment elevation MI or unstable angina were less likely to undergo nonprimary percutaneous coronary intervention (48% v. 66%, p < 0.001). Clinical determinants of poorer access to care included anxiety, increased number of risk factors and absence of chest pain. Gender-related determinants included feminine traits of personality and responsibility for housework.Among younger adults with acute coronary syndrome, women and men had different access to care. Moreover, fewer than half of men and women with ST-segment elevation MI received timely primary coronary intervention. Our results also highlight that men and women with no chest pain and those with anxiety, several traditional risk factors and feminine personality traits were at particularly increased risk of poorer access to care."mycardial	CLIN	"The study sought to determine the 99th percentile upper reference limit for the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T assay (hs-cTnT) in 3 large independent cohorts.The presently recommended 14 ng/l cut point for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction using the hs-cTnT assay was derived from small studies of presumably healthy individuals, with relatively little phenotypic characterization.Data were included from 3 well-characterized population-based studies: the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). Within each cohort, reference subcohorts were defined excluding individuals with recent hospitalization, overt cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease (subcohort 1), and further excluding those with subclinical structural heart disease (subcohort 2). Data were analyzed stratified by age, sex, and race.The 99th percentile values for the hs-cTnT assay in DHS, ARIC, and CHS were 18, 22, and 36 ng/l (subcohort 1) and 14, 21, and 28 ng/l (subcohort 2), respectively. These differences in 99th percentile values paralleled age differences across cohorts. Analyses within sex/age strata yielded similar results between cohorts. Within each cohort, 99th percentile values increased with age and were higher in men. More than 10% of men 65 to 74 years of age with no cardiovascular disease in our study had cardiac troponin T values above the current myocardial infarction threshold.Use of a uniform 14 ng/l cutoff for the hs-cTnT assay may lead to over-diagnosis of myocardial infarction, particularly in men and the elderly. Clinical validation is needed of new age- and sex-specific cutoff values for this assay."mycardial	EPI	"Emotional stress may disproportionally affect young women with ischemic heart disease. We sought to examine whether mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI), but not exercise-induced ischemia, is more common in young women with previous myocardial infarction (MI) than in men.We studied 98 post-MI patients (49 women and 49 men) aged 38 to 60 years. Women and men were matched for age, MI type, and months since MI. Patients underwent technetium-99m sestamibi perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Perfusion defect scores were obtained with observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify ischemia under both stress conditions.Women 50 years or younger, but not older women, showed a more adverse psychosocial profile than did age-matched men but did not differ for conventional risk factors and tended to have less angiographic coronary artery disease. Compared with age-matched men, women 50 years or younger exhibited a higher SDS with mental stress (3.1 versus 1.5, p = .029) and had twice the rate of MSIMI (SDS â‰¥ 3; 52% versus 25%), whereas ischemia with physical stress did not differ (36% versus 25%). In older patients, there were no sex differences in MSIMI. The higher prevalence of MSIMI in young women persisted when adjusting for sociodemographic and life-style factors, coronary artery disease severity, and depression.MSIMI post-MI is more common in women 50 years or younger compared with age-matched men. These sex differences are not observed in post-MI patients who are older than 50 years."mycardial	OUTC	"Data regarding sex-based outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for myocardial infarction are mixed. We sought to examine whether sex differences in outcomes exist in contemporary practice.We examined acute myocardial infarction patients undergoing PCI between April 2010 and October 2012 at 210 US hospitals participating in the Treatment with Adenosine Diphosphate Receptor Inhibitors: Longitudinal Assessment of Treatment Patterns and Events after Acute Coronary Syndrome (TRANSLATE-ACS) observational study. Outcomes included 1-year risk of major adverse cardiac events and bleeding according to Global Utilization of Strategies To Open Occluded Arteries (GUSTO) and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) definitions. Among 6218 patients, 27.5% (n=1712) were female. Compared with men, women were older, had more comorbidities, and had lower functional status. Use of multivessel PCI and drug-eluting stents was similar between sexes, while women received less prasugrel. Unadjusted cumulative incidence of 1-year major adverse cardiac events was higher for women than for men (15.7% versus 13.6%, P=0.02), but female sex was no longer associated with higher incidence of major adverse cardiac events after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15). Female sex was associated with higher risks of post-PCI GUSTO bleeding (9.1% versus 5.7%, P<0.0001) and postdischarge BARC bleeding (39.6% versus 27.9%, P<0.0001). Differences persisted after adjustment (GUSTO: hazard ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.64; BARC: incidence rate ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.56).Female and male myocardial infarction patients undergoing PCI differ regarding demographic, clinical, and treatment profiles. These differences appear to explain the higher observed major adverse cardiac event rate but not higher adjusted bleeding risk for women versus men."mycardial	OUTC	"Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Vietnam. We conducted a pilot study of Hanoi residents hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at the Vietnam National Heart Institute in Hanoi. The objectives of this observational study were to examine sex differences in clinical characteristics, hospital management, in-hospital clinical complications, and mortality in patients hospitalized with an initial AMI.The study population consisted of 302 Hanoi residents hospitalized with a first AMI at the largest tertiary care medical center in Hanoi in 2010.The average age of study patients was 66 years and one third were women. Women were older (70 vs. 64 years) and were more likely than men to have had hyperlipidemia previously diagnosed (10% vs. 2%). During hospitalization, women were less likely to have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with men (57% vs. 74%), and women were more likely to have developed heart failure compared with men (19% vs. 10%). Women experienced higher in-hospital case-fatality rates (CFRs) than men (13% vs. 4%) and these differences were attenuated after adjustment for age and history of hyperlipidemia (OR: 2.64; 95% CI: 1.01, 6.89), and receipt of PCI during hospitalization (OR: 2.09; 95% CI: 0.77, 5.09).Our pilot data suggest that among patients hospitalized with a first AMI in Hanoi, women experienced higher in-hospital CFRs than men. Full-scale surveillance of all Hanoi residents hospitalized with AMI at all Hanoi medical centers is needed to confirm these findings. More targeted and timely educational and treatment approaches for women appear warranted."mycardial	EPI	"A number of previous studies have suggested that overweight or obese patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) may have lower morbidity and mortality than their leaner counterparts. Few studies have addressed possible gender differences, and the results are conflicting. We examined the association between body mass index (BMI) and risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiovascular (CV) death and all-cause mortality in men and women with suspected stable angina pectoris.The cohort included 4164 patients with suspected stable angina undergoing elective coronary angiography between 2000 and 2004. Events were registered until the end of 2006. Hazard ratios (HR) (95% confidence intervals) were estimated using Cox regression by comparing normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2) with overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (â‰¥30 kg/m2) patients. Underweight (<18.5 kg/m2) patients were excluded from the study.Of 4131 patients with complete data, 72% were males and 75% were diagnosed with significant CAD. The mean (standard deviation (SD)) age in the total population was 62 (10) years. Mean (SD) BMI was 26.8 (3.9) kg/m2, 34% was normal weight, 48% overweight and 19% obese. During follow up, a total of 337 (8.2%) experienced an AMI and 302 (7.3%) patients died, of whom 165 (4.0%) died from cardiovascular causes. We observed a significant interaction between BMI groups and gender with regards to risk of AMI (pâ€‰=â€‰0.011) and CV death (pâ€‰=â€‰0.031), but not to risk of all-cause mortality; obese men had a multivariate adjusted increased risk of AMI (HR 1.80 (1.28, 2.52)) and CV death (HR 1.60 (1.00, 2.55)) compared to normal weight men. By contrast, overweight women had a decreased risk of AMI (HR 0.56 (0.33, 0.98)) compared to normal weight women. The risk of all-cause mortality did not differ between BMI categories.Compared with normal weight subjects, obese men had an increased risk of AMI and CV death, while overweight women had a decreased risk of AMI. These findings may potentially explain some of the result variation in previous studies reporting on the obesity paradox."mycardial	CLIN	"Emergency treatment options in myocardial infarction are guided by presence or absence of ST-elevations in electrocardiography. Occurrence and factors associated with ST-presentation in different population groups are however inadequately known.To determine likelihood and patient features associated with ST-elevations in myocardial infarction.Nationwide registry study including 22 hospitals with angiolaboratory during an eight year period in Finland.Hospitalized care.68,162 consecutive patients aged â‰¥ 30 with myocardial infarction.Likelihood and patient features associated with presence of ST-elevations.Myocardial infarction presented with ST-elevation in 37.5% (CI 37.0-37.9%) and without in 62.5% (CI 61.9-63.1%) of patients, p<0.0001. Majority of patients aged 30-59 years with myocardial infarction had ST-elevation, but among octogenarians ST-elevations were present in only 24.7%. Presence of ST-elevations decreased with age by estimated 15.6% (CI 15.0-16.2%) per 10 year increase (p<0.0001). Men aged 40-79 years had significantly higher rate for ST-elevation myocardial infarction compared to women. Sex-based difference in presentation of myocardial infarction declined with increasing age. Overall, men had a 13% (CI 11-15%, p<0.0001) higher relative risk for ST-elevations compared to women when adjusted for age and co-morbidities. Diabetes, atrial fibrillation, peripheral or cerebral artery disease, chronic pulmonary disease, malignancy, and renal insufficiency were associated with absence of ST-elevations in myocardial infarction in multivariate analysis.Myocardial infarction presents with ST-elevations more commonly in men. Presence of ST-elevations decreases with increasing age. Diabetes, atrial fibrillation, peripheral or cerebral artery disease, chronic pulmonary disease, malignancy, and renal insufficiency are associated with absence of ST-elevations in myocardial infarction. These findings may help to predict likelihood of ST-elevations in a patient with myocardial infarction."mycardial	MANAG	"It is uncertain whether gender differences in outcome after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are only attributable to different baseline characteristics or additional factors.Databases of two German myocardial infarction network registries were combined with a total of 1104 consecutive patients admitted with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and treated according to standardized protocols.Approximately 25% of patients were females. Mean age (69 vs 61 years), incidence of diabetes (28% vs 20%), hypertension (68 vs 58%) and renal insufficiency (26% vs 19%) was significantly higher compared to males. Mean prehospital delay was numerically longer in females (227 vs 209 min) as was in hospital delay (35 vs 30 min). PCI was finally performed in 92% of females and 95% of males with comparable procedural success (95% vs 97%). Use of drug eluting stents (55% vs 68%) and application of GP 2b 3a blockers (75% vs 89%) was significantly less frequent in women. At discharge, prescription of beta blockers and lipid lowering drugs was also significantly lower in females (84% vs 90% and 71% vs 84%). Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in females (10% vs 5%) without attenuation after 12 months. Adjusted mortality however did not differ significantly between genders.Higher unadjusted mortality in females after primary PCI was accompanied by significant differences in baseline characteristics, interventional approach and secondary prophylaxis in spite of the same standard of care. Lower guideline adherence seems to be less gender specific but rather a manifestation of the risk-treatment paradox."mycardial	MANAG	"The SMILE studies proved the prognostic benefit of zofenopril vs. placebo or other ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) in post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In this retrospective pooled analysis of these studies we assessed whether the zofenopril effect is influenced by gender.The four double-blind, randomized, parallel-group SMILE studies, compared the efficacy and safety of 6-48 week treatment with zofenopril 60 mg/day with that of placebo, lisinopril 10 mg/day or ramipril 10 mg/day in 3630 AMI patients. This pooled analysis compared treatment efficacy (1-year combined occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes) in 2733 men and 897 women.Women were older than men, had a higher prevalence of diabetes and of other major CV risk factors. The risk of a major CV event was significantly larger for women (23% vs. 17% men, p<0.001). Between-gender risk difference was more marked for people living in Southern (+54%) than in Northern Europe (+12%). In both genders zofenopril similarly reduced the 1-year risk of CV morbidity and mortality vs. placebo (-39% men, pâ€Š=â€Š0.0001; -40% women, pâ€Š=â€Š0.005). The risk reduction was more marked with zofenopril than with the other ACEIs, particularly in men (-27%, pâ€Š=â€Š0.012; women: -14%, pâ€Š=â€Š0.479). The drug safety profile was similar between genders in zofenopril-treated patients, while it was worse in women treated with other ACEIs.Post-AMI women are at higher risk of CV complications than men, particularly when living in Mediterranean countries. Their response to ACE-inhibition varies according to the type of drug and is usually better in men."mycardial	OUTC	"Mortality rates after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have declined, but there is uncertainty regarding the extent of improvements in early mortality in the elderly.Mixed-effects regression analysis of 30-day mortality using data from 478,242 patients with AMI at 215 hospitals in England and Wales stratified by STEMI/NSTEMI, sex, and age group. A hospital opportunity-based composite score (OBCS) for aspirin, ACE-inhibitor, statin, Î² blocker, and referral for cardiac rehabilitation was used as measure of quality of hospital care.30-day mortality rates (95% CI) fell from 10.7% (10.6 to 10.9%) in 2004/5 to 8.4% (8.3 to 8.6%) in 2008/9. The median (IQR) hospital OBCSs increased over time, 2004/5: 87.3 (7.2), 2006/7: 88.9 (6.3), 2008/9: 90.3 (6.1), P<0.001, and were similar between age groups (18 to <65 years, 65 to 79 years, and â‰¥ 80 years) for STEMI: 89.4 (6.5) vs. 89.4 (6.6), vs. 89.2 (6.5) and NSTEMI: 88.6 (7.3) vs. 88.8 (7.0) vs. 88.9 (7.0), respectively For males, all age groups except patients <65 years demonstrated a significant decrease in adjusted mortality. For females, only patients â‰¥ 80 years demonstrated a significant reduction in adjusted mortality. A 1% increase in hospital OBCS was associated with a 1% decrease in 30-day mortality (95% CI: 0.99 to 0.99, P<0.001).In England and Wales, for patients with AMI there are age and sex-dependent differences in improvements in 30-day mortality. Whereas young males with AMI have reached an acceptable performance plateau, all other groups are either improving or, more importantly, are yet to demonstrate this."mycardial	OUTC	"Previous studies of patients admitted for ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] have indicated that women have a higher risk of early mortality than do men. These studies have presented limited information on gender related differences in the short term and almost no information on the long term.We analysed a prospective, consecutively included STEMI population consisting of 54,146 patients (35% women). This population consists of almost all patients hospitalised in Sweden between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2006 as recorded in the SWEDEHEART register (formerly RIKS-HIA). Follow-up time ranged from one to 13 years (mean 4.6). Women had a lower probability of being given reperfusion therapy, odds ratio [OR] 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.88). During the time these STEMI patients were in the hospital, 13% of the women and 7% of men died, multivariable adjusted OR 1.21 (95% CI 1.11-1.32). During the follow up period, 46% of the women died as compared with 32% of the men. There was, however, no gender difference in age-adjusted risk of long term mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.98, 95% CI 0.95-1.01) whereas the multivariable adjusted risk was lower in women (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.96). The long term risk of re-infarction was the same in men and women (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93-1.03) whereas men in the youngest group had a higher risk than women in that age group (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-0.94).In STEMI, women had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality but the long-term risk of death was higher in men. More studies are needed in the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) era that are designed to determine why women fare worse than men after STEMI during the first phase when they are in hospital."mycardial	MANAG	"Gender-based differences in diabetic patients are understudied in the field of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents.Data were obtained from a multicenter registry of 2420 consecutive patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) who underwent PCI with paclitaxel- or sirolimus-eluting stents between 2003 and 2009. Among them, 679 (28.1%) women were compared to 1741 (71.9%) men in terms of clinical aspects and major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI) and target lesion revascularization (TLR). Target vessel revascularization (TVR) and any revascularization were also reported.Women were less numerous, older, used more insulin and showed more tortuous coronary arteries, while men were more frequently smokers and received larger stents. At the median follow-up of 24.3 months (interquartile range 12.3-39.7), MACE, TVR and any revascularization did not significantly differ between females and males (19.9% vs 18.7%, 12.2% vs 13.4%, 14.1% vs 15.1%, respectively). At multivariable analysis of the overall cohort, female gender was not a predictor of MACE (hazard ratio [HR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92-2.36, p=0.11), death (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84-1.24, p=0.86), MI (HR 1.48, 95% CI 0.92-2.36, p=0.11), and TLR (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.85-1.52, p=0.38).In this registry of diabetic patients treated by drug-eluting stents, women were less represented, older and needed more insulin compared to men who, on the other hand, received larger stents. Gender-related outcomes were similar and female sex did not predict MACE."mycardial	EPI	"The aim was to investigate possible gender differences in the years of life lost after acute myocardial infarction (MI) and to explore how smoking affects life expectancy in the two genders.In the years 1998-2005, 2281 patients (36.8% women) who were discharged from or died in hospital following a diagnosis of MI were included. Survivors were followed for a mean of 8 years. The age of death for each patient was subtracted from the average projected age of death for individuals in the general population with a similar age to the patient at the time of their MI. The effects of gender, smoking, and other risk factors on the years of life lost were analysed.During follow-up, 55% of the patients died. Non-smokers, ex-smokers and current smokers lost 5.4, 6.4 and 10.3 years of life, respectively. Structural equation modeling showed that currently smoking men lost 4.2 more years more than did non-smoking men (P<0.001), and this was mediated through more prematurely occurring MIs. Female current smokers lost 1.9 years more than male current smokers and female ex-smokers lost 1.8 years more than male ex-smokers (both P<0.001).MI caused a substantial number of years of life lost, with a heavier loss in current smokers than in ex-smokers and non-smokers. The effect was predominantly related to the patient's age at the event. More years of life were lost among smoking women than among smoking men, indicating that smoking is most detrimental for the female gender."mycardial	OUTC	"Previous studies on gender differences in outcome in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have been performed, but most of those are from before the current era of PCI technique and medical therapy and have a short duration of follow-up. The objective of our study is to assess the influence of gender on long-term outcome in patients with STEMI who underwent primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) between January 2006 and May 2008.Two-year follow-up data from 202 female and 668 male patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI were available from the DEBATER (A Comparison of Drug Eluting and Bare Metal Stents for Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with or without Abciximab in ST-segment elevation Myocardial Infarction: The Eindhoven Reperfusion Study) trial database. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as the composite of death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization.Women were older (64.7â€‰Â±â€‰11.7 vs. 59.0â€‰Â±â€‰10.7; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and had more often diabetes mellitus (15% vs. 9%; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) and hypertension (44% vs. 25%; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). At two years, the rate of MACE was significantly higher in women (21% vs. 14%; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02). The mortality rate in women was 8% versus 2.6% in men (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). However, multivariate analysis after adjustment for age and the baseline characteristics hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, stent diameter, and time between onset of symptoms and arrival of the ambulance showed similar MACE and mortality rates in men and women.Women have higher rates of both MACE and mortality after primary PCI for STEMI compared to men because of higher age with higher baseline risk profiles."mycardial	OUTC	"Among patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiogenic shock (CS) is the leading cause of death, complicating up to 10% of admissions. Introduction of early revascularization strategies and mechanical ventricular support have seen short-term mortality associated with CS fall from 70% to 80% in the 1970s to approximately 50% to 60% in the 1990s. Previous studies reported a higher incidence of CS after AMI in women (11.6% vs 8.3%). The aims of this study were to determine hospital mortality outcomes and gender differences following primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) in the setting of CS. Data were collected prospectively among all patients undergoing PPCI for AMI at a large UK tertiary cardiac center between April 2008 and October 2011. A sample of 2,864 patients (women: 844 [29.5%]) underwent PPCI, of which 141 (4.9%) had a confirmed diagnosis of CS. Eighty-one of 2,019 [4.0%] male patients (mean age: 64.2 years) and 60 of 844 [7.1%]) female patients (mean age: 69.9 years) with CS underwent PPCI (p <0.001). The overall hospital mortality was 35.5% with no gender difference (male: 35.8% vs female: 35%, p >0.99). In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates that in the contemporary PPCI era, there is a reduction in the incidence of CS with reduced hospital mortality rates and no gender difference. The absence of a gender difference is remarkable because higher proportions of women presented with CS and were older than their male counterparts. Long-term follow-up data are required to determine if this difference is sustained."mycardial	MANAG	"Women are underrepresented in clinical research, and few data are available from randomized head-to-head comparisons of second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) in female patients. Aim of this study was to assess safety and efficacy of two second-generation DES in women. In TWENTE-a prospective, randomized, comparative DES trial-""real-world"" patients were stratified for gender before randomization for Resolute or Xience V stents.Target vessel failure (TVF; cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, and clinically indicated target vessel revascularization) after 1 year was the predefined endpoint.Among 1,391 patients, 382 (27.5%) women were randomized to Resolute (nâ€‰=â€‰192) and Xience V (nâ€‰=â€‰190). Baseline and procedural characteristics were similar for females in both study arms, except for smaller vessel and stent diameters in Resolute-treated lesions. After 1 year, TVF (8.9 vs. 8.4%; adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-2.20, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.91) and a patient-oriented composite endpoint (13.0 vs. 12.1%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.79) did not differ significantly between women in both arms. Women were older than men (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) and had more often diabetes mellitus (26.4 vs. 19.8%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) and hypertension (63.6 vs. 52.5%, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01), but there was no significant gender difference in TVF (adjusted OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.73-1.92, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.50).This gender-stratified TWENTE trial analysis resulted in no significant difference in safety and efficacy outcomes between Resolute- and Xience V-treated females."mycardial	OUTC	"Several studies have found that among patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated by thrombolysis, female sex is associated with a worse outcome. However, still controversial is the prognostic impact of gender in primary angioplasty, especially in the era of drug-eluting stents (DES). Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate sex-related differences in clinical outcome in patients with STEMI treated with primary angioplasty with Bare-Metal Stent (BMS) or DES.Our population is represented by 6298 STEMI patients undergoing primary angioplasty and stent implantation included in the DESERT database. Follow-up data were collected from 3 to 6 years after primary angioplasty.Female gender was observed in 1466 (23.2%) out of 6298 STEMI patients. Women were older (65.3 Â± 12.4 vs 59.3 Â± 11.4 years, p < 0.001), with higher prevalence of diabetes (18.6% vs 14.5%, p < 0.001), hypertension (52.4% vs 41.4%, p < 0.001), slightly longer ischemia time (272 Â± 247 vs 258 Â± 220 min, p = 0.06). No difference was observed in terms of angiographic and procedural characteristics. Follow-up data were available at a mean of 1201 Â± 441 days. At long-term follow-up female gender was associated with a significantly higher rate of death (11.7% vs 8.5%, HR [95% CI] = 1.45 [1.18-1.78], p < 0.001), while no difference was observed in terms of reinfarction (HR [95% CI] = 1.14 [0.89-1.45], p = 0.3), ST (HR [95% CI] = 1.12 [0.85-1.48], p = 0.4), with similar temporal distribution (acute, subacute, late and very late) between male and female patients, and no difference in TVR (HR [95% CI] = 1.11 [0.95-1.3], p = 0.2, p = 0.2). These results were confirmed in both patients receiving BMS or DES. The impact of female gender on mortality disappeared after correction for baseline confounding factors (HR [95% CI] = 0.88 [0.71-1.09], p = 0.25).This study shows that in patients with STEMI treated by primary angioplasty, female gender is associated with higher mortality rate in comparison with men, and this is mainly due to their higher clinical and angiographic risk profiles. In fact, female sex did not emerge as an independent predictor of mortality."mycardial	REVIEW	"Scientific interest in ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in women has grown considerably over the past 2 decades. A substantial amount of the literature on this subject is centred on sex differences in clinical aspects of IHD. Many reports have documented sex-related differences in presentation, risk profiles, and outcomes among patients with IHD, particularly acute myocardial infarction. Such differences have often been attributed to inequalities between men and women in the referral and treatment of IHD, but data are insufficient to support this assessment. The determinants of sex differences in presentation are unclear, and few clues are available as to why young, premenopausal women paradoxically have a greater incidence of adverse outcomes after acute myocardial infarction than men, despite having less-severe coronary artery disease. Although differential treatment on the basis of patient sex continues to be described, the extent to which such inequalities persist and whether they reflect true disparity is unclear. Additionally, much uncertainty surrounds possible sex-related differences in response to cardiovascular therapies, partly because of a persistent lack of female-specific data from cardiovascular clinical trials. In this Review, we assess the evidence for sex-related differences in the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of IHD, and identify gaps in the literature that need to be addressed in future research efforts."mycardial	EPI	"To compare risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality, stroke mortality, and hospitalizations for males and females with and without diabetes and those with diabetes diagnosed early and late.We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study including 73,783 individuals aged 25 years or older in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada (15,152 with diabetes; 9,517 with late diagnoses).Males and females with diabetes had an increased risk of all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, AMI mortality, and CVD hospitalizations compared with individuals without diabetes, and the risk was stronger in females than in males. For females, risks of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.85 [95% CI 1.74-1.96]) and CVD hospitalizations (2.57 [2.24-2.94]) were significantly higher compared with their male counterparts (1.59 [1.51-1.69] and 1.92 [1.72-2.14]). Females with diabetes diagnosed late had an increased risk of CVD mortality (6.54 [4.80-8.91]) and CVD hospitalizations (5.22 [4.31-6.33]) compared with females without diabetes, and both were significantly higher compared with their male counterparts (3.44 [2.47-4.79]) and (3.33 [2.80-3.95]).Females with diabetes have a greater risk of mortality than males with diabetes. CVD has a greater impact on females with diabetes than males, especially when diagnosed at a later stage. Different management strategies should be considered for males and females and those with early and late diagnoses of diabetes."mycardial	OUTC	"Unfavourable effect of female sex on short- and long-term clinical outcomes has been demonstrated in unselected ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients; the results are conflicting in patients who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). The objective of this substudy was to determine whether there are sex-related differences in the 30-day and 1-year clinical outcomes and bleeding after PPCI for STEMI.We analyzed 2096 STEMI patients enrolled in the Risk Scoring Model to Predict Net Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes After Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (RISK-PCI) trial from February 2006 to December 2009. Composite efficacy end point comprised all-cause mortality, nonfatal infarction, and stroke. Safety end point was bleeding classified according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) criteria. Net adverse cardiovascular events included composite efficacy end point and total bleeding.Women in our study were older and presented later than men. After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no difference between sexes with respect to the composite efficacy end point. A higher rate of total bleeding was observed in women (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.61 at 30 days, adjusted OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.08-2.47 at 1 year) compared with men. Total bleeding was associated with increased mortality at 30 days (OR, 4.87; 95% CI, 2.79-8.47) and at 1 year (OR, 4.43; 95% CI, 2.79-7.02) after PPCI.We did not find a significant sex-related difference with respect to the composite efficacy end point. Women had a higher rate of total bleeding which was associated with increased short- and long-term mortality. Specific measures aimed at preventing bleeding in women might improve the prognosis of PPCI patients."mycardial	EPI	"Traditionally coronary artery disease (CAD) has been considered as disease affecting men, and for long time women were not included in researches programme. In both sexes, coronary heart disease risk increases with age. Extensive clinical and statistical studies have identified serial factors that increase the risk of coronary heart disease, some of them can be modified, and some cannot. This study was performed to analyze the extent to which cardiovascular risk factors can explain the gender difference in coronary heart disease.The study design is a cross sectional study based on 155 cardiac patients admitted to cardiology department in Al-shifa hospital Gaza. The following cardiac risk factors were determined from the patient's records, smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, Dyslipedemia and presence of family history of coronary artery disease. Catheterization results review were done. Statistical Package for Social Science version 17 was used for data entry and analysis. Frequency and cross tabulation were done to explore the relationship between the study variables. Chi-square test was used for testing statistical and P-value less than 0.05 were considered as significant.Most of risk factors were more favorable in females and increase with age. Myocardial infarction in male compared with female was 2 times higher, and chronic angina pain is common in female than male respectively 71.4% and 46.7%. Around 77% of female have two vessels disease and more. No great differences in number of diseased vessels among patients with myocardial infarction or chronic stable angina. Patients with low EF <50% have higher chance of affected vessels (82.9%).CAD stay the major problem in male and female, certain patient's characteristics and clinical conditions may place female at higher risk of coronary artery disease development or progression. This article addresses emerging knowledge regarding gender differences in CAD risk factors and responsiveness to risk reduction interventions."mycardial	EPI	"Controversies concerning the association between obesity and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are still ongoing in Japan. We investigated the association between obesity defined by body mass index of 25 kg/m(2) or higher and AMI by a case-control study using data from 1199 AMI cases and 4056 apparently healthy controls. The analysis was performed in age- and sex-matched samples of 621 case-control pairs younger than 80 years and in crude samples aged 40-79 years divided into 10-year age groups. Prevalence of obesity, diabetes, current smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia were compared between cases and controls, and a multivariable odds ratio (OR) of AMI was calculated for each risk factor in various age groups. The OR (95 % confidence interval (CI)) of AMI for obesity was 1.63 (1.23-2.17), P = 0.0008 in men younger than 80 years; 2.65 (1.41-5.00), P = 0.0025 in women younger than 80 years; 2.23 (1.46-3.41), P = 0.0002 in men aged 59 years or younger; 1.34 (0.90-2.01), P = 0.1510 in men aged 60-79 years; and 2.98 (1.56-5.71), P = 0.0010 in women aged 60-79 years using paired samples. The OR (95 % CI) of AMI for obesity was 4.92 (2.53-9.58), P < 0.0001 in men aged 40-49 years; 1.54 (1.07-2.21), P = 0.0197 in men aged 50-59 years; 1.07 (0.69-1.66), P = 0.7717 in men aged 60-69 years; 2.24 (1.20-4.20), P = 0.0118 in men aged 70-79 years; 2.48 (1.12-5.48), P = 0.0245 in women aged 60-69 years; and 3.05 (1.46-6.37), P = 0.0029 in women aged 70-79 years using crude samples. The association between obesity and AMI was age- and gender-dependent in a Japanese population. "mycardial	OUTC	"To investigate the importance of vessel size on outcome differences by comparing the effects of drug-eluting stents (DES) versus bare-metal stents (BMS) in women and men with large coronary vessels.All 2314 BASKET-PROVE patients randomized to DES versus BMS were followed for 2 years with a primary endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACE: cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, target-vessel revascularization). Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the relative risk for women and men, respectively. All comparisons were adjusted for vessel size.Age, risk factors and complexity of coronary artery disease differed between women and men. DES reduced MACE rates at 2 years compared to BMS--in women: 4% vs. 15%, p<0.0001 with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.27 (0.15-0.51), and men: 6% vs. 10%, p=0.003 (HR=0.60 (0.43-0.84)), respectively. The association persisted in both women (HR=0.25 (0.13-0.46)) and men (HR=0.60 (0.42-0.84)) following multivariable adjustments. A significant gender-treatment interaction was present (p=0.02). The reduced risk of MACE following DES vs. BMS implantation was present until 6 months in both women (HR=0.15 (0.06-0.36)) and men (HR=0.32 (0.17-0.59)) and remained significant until 2 years in women (HR=0.36 (0.15-0.87)), but not in men (HR=0.87 (0.49-1.55)).In women and men with similarly sized large coronary arteries, DES reduced 2-year MACE rates compared to BMS, but the significant gender-treatment interaction indicated a greater benefit of DES in women. Thus, factors other than vessel size seem to determine this gender difference."mycardial	EPI	"Risk factors for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are known to cluster and to be differently distributed in men and women. The aim of this study was to sex-specifically explore clusters of acknowledged AMI risk factors by factor analysis, and to study whether such clusters are associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), used as a subclinical measure of CHD.In 2001-2005, 2328 subjects (30-74 years) were randomly selected from two municipalities in Sweden (participation-rate 76%) and were assessed with regard to cardiovascular risk factors; 852 participants also had an echocardiographic examination performed.Factor analysis identified three identical factors in men and women. WHR, HOMA-ir, systolic blood pressure, and ApoB/ApoA1 loaded significantly on the principal ""metabolic factor"", leisure-time physical activity and self-rated health loaded significantly on the ""vitality factor"", and smoking and alcohol consumption loaded significantly on the ""addiction factor"". The metabolic factor was associated with LVH in both men (P<0.001) and women (P<0.001), whereas the addiction factor was associated with LVH solely in men (P=0.002).The consistent pattern in the clustering of acknowledged AMI risk factors suggests common underlying mechanisms in both men and women. However, whereas the metabolic factor was paramount in both men and women in the association with LVH, the addiction factor had an impact solely in men. As LVH often precedes AMI, a deeper understanding of risk factors for LVH, including consideration of the supposed sex differences, can be useful in order to explore prevention strategies for AMI."mycardial	OUTC	"We evaluated the effects of myocardial perfusion after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on gender-based mortality rates. Research has demonstrated a gender-specific response of cardiomyocytes to ischemia and a potential increase in myocardial salvage in women compared with men. Myocardial blush grade (MBG), an angiographic surrogate of myocardial perfusion, is an independent predictor of early and late survival after AMI. Whether the incidence and prognosis of myocardial perfusion differs according to gender among patients with AMI undergoing PCI is unknown. MBG and short- and long-term mortality were evaluated in 1,301 patients (maleÂ = 935; femaleÂ = 366) with AMI randomized to primary angioplasty Â± abciximab versus stent Â± abciximab. Following PCI, >96% of patients achieved final Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 3 flow, of which MBG 2/3 was present in 58.3% of women versus 51.1% of men (pÂ = 0.02). Worse MBG was an independent predictor of mortality in women at 30 days (7.4% for MBG 0/1 vs 2.4% for MBG 2/3, pÂ = 0.04) and at 1-year (11.0% for MBG 0/1 vs 3.4% for MBG 2/3, pÂ = 0.01); however, MBG was not associated with differences in mortality for men. In conclusion, impaired myocardial perfusion following PCI for AMI, indicated by worse MBG, is an independent predictor of early and late mortality in women but not in men. These findings imply an enhanced survival benefit from restoring myocardial perfusion for women compared with men during primary angioplasty and may have clinical implications for interventional strategies in women. "mycardial	MANAG	"A delayed Door-to-Balloon (DTB) time in women with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been associated with an increased mortality. The objectives of this study were to (a) quantify the components of the delayed DTB time in women and (b) assess the independent effect of gender on DTB time in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI.Clinical parameters were prospectively collected for 735 STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI from 2006 to 2010, with particular attention to the components of DTB time, including the onset of chest pain and the 'code' notification of the STEMI team by the Emergency Department.Women were significantly older with more co-morbidity. Upon hospital arrival they also experienced delays in Door-to-Code (23 vs. 17 min, P=.012), Code-to-Balloon (63 vs. 57 min, P=.001) and thus DTB time (88 vs. 72 min, P=.001). After multivariate adjustment, independent determinants of DTB time included female gender (ratio of geometric means [RGM]=1.13; 95% CI 1.02-1.26; P=.022), hypertension (RGM=1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.23, P=.014), maximum ST-elevation (RGM=0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.98, P<.001), office hours (RGM=0.84, 95% CI 0.78-0.92, P<.001) and triage category (RGM=1.23, 95% CI 1.09-1.40, P=.001).Women experience delays in identification of the STEMI diagnosis and also in the PCI process. Thus a multifaceted approach addressing both the diagnosis and management of STEMI in women is required."mycardial	OUTC	"To evaluate the gender differences on the short-term outcomes of patients with acute myocardial infarction in the real world.A total of 471 consecutive patients [male 368(78.1%) and female 103(21.9%)] with acute myocardial infarction <72 hours in cardiac care unit were included. The clinical data, death and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 30 days post hospitalization were analyzed.Female patients were older (66.8 Â± 10.1 vs. 56.9 Â± 12.0, P < 0.001), TIMI score (5.1 Â± 2.3 vs. 3.9 Â± 2.1, P < 0.001) and GRACE score (162 Â± 39 vs. 142 Â± 35, P < 0.001) in female patients were higher than in male patients. Female patients had lower proportion of stent implantation (P = 0.038) while higher percentage of complex lesions and contraindications to PCI (P = 0.015) compared to male patients. Proportion of cardiac rupture, mitral regurgitation, malignant arrhythmia, post-infarction angina pectoris, contrast-induced nephropathy and minor gastrointestinal bleeding were also higher in female patients tan in male patients (P < 0.05). Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in female patients than in male patients [5.8% (6/103) vs. 1.9% (7/368), P = 0.032], MACCE [10.7% (11/103) vs. 5.4% (20/368), P = 0.058] also tended to be higher in female patients than in male patients. Multi-logistic regression analysis showed that female gender was not an independent predictor for thirty-day mortality (P = 0.141) or MACCE (P = 0.426) while systolic blood pressure (OR = 1.072, 95%CI:1.016-1.130, P = 0.010) and pericardial effusion after myocardial infarction (OR = 40.518, 95%CI:1.098-1495.702, P = 0.044) were independent predictors for thirty-day mortality while systolic blood pressure (OR = 1.027, 95%CI:1.002-1.052, P = 0.036) and left ventricular ejection fraction (OR = 1.108, 95%CI:1.032-1.190, P = 0.005) were independent predictors for MACCE.Female gender itself is not an independent predictor for thirty-day mortality and MACCE despite poorer clinical characteristics, higher incidence of complications, and worse prognosis in female patients."mycardial	OUTC	"Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women worldwide. Little is known about gender-based differences in lipid goal attainment during secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. We conducted this study to analyze gender differences in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target attainment in secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction over a 5-year period. In this retrospective study, the electronic database of lipid clinic at a single center was used as the data source. Temporal trends and gender differences in demographics, lipid profile, and medication use were determined. Goal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was defined per National Cholesterol Education Program ATP III guidelines.A total of 1365 patients (823 males, 542 females) constituted the study sample. Patients in 2007 were older than those in 2003 (females 68.6 Â± 14 vs. 70.7 Â± 11.7 years; males 63.6 Â± 12 vs. 65.8 Â± 11 years; P < 0.05) and had a higher body mass index (females 27.8 Â± 1 vs. 28.6 Â± 1 kg/m; males 27.6 Â± 1 vs. 28.1 Â± 1 kg/m, in 2003 and 2007 respectively, P < 0.05). Mean LDL decreased significantly overtime in both males and females. No gender difference in lipid-lowering therapy was observed. Females had a higher LDL than did males in 2003 (115.3 Â± 12.3 vs. 99.7 Â± 12.5 mg/dL; P < 0.05), and this difference persisted through 2007 (102.2 Â± 11.7 vs. 91.3 Â± 11.2 mg/dL; P < 0.05). Overall rate of achieving goal LDL improved from 76.5% (2003) to 83.02% (2007), P < 0.05, but remained lower for females than for males both in 2003 and 2007 [69.8% vs. 80.1% (2003), P < 0.05, and 77.9% vs. 85.6% (2007), P < 0.05].The trend over a recent 5-year period shows that females are less likely to achieve goal LDL than males are, and it indicates the need for more aggressive lipid-lowering strategies in females. "mycardial	CLIN	"Little is known about whether sex differences in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentation exist in young patients and what factors determine absence of chest pain in ACS presentation.To evaluate sex differences in ACS presentation and to estimate associations between sex, sociodemographic, gender identity, psychosocial and clinical factors, markers of coronary disease severity, and absence of chest pain in young patients with ACS.We conducted a prospective cohort study of 1015 patients (30% women) 55 years or younger, hospitalized for ACS and enrolled in the GENESIS PRAXY (Gender and Sex Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease: From Bench to Beyond Premature Acute Coronary Syndrome) study (January 2009-September 2012).The McSweeney Acute and Prodromal Myocardial Infarction Symptom Survey was administered during hospitalization.The median age for both sexes was 49 years. Women were more likely to have non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (37.5 vs 30.7; P = .03) and present without chest pain compared with men (19.0% vs 13.7%; P = .03). Patients without chest pain reported fewer symptoms overall and no discernable pattern of non-chest pain symptoms was found. In the multivariate model, being a woman (odds ratio [OR], 1.95 [95% CI, 1.23-3.11]; P = .005) and tachycardia (OR, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.20-3.56]; P = .009) were independently associated with ACS presentation without chest pain. Patients without chest pain did not differ significantly from those with chest pain in terms of ACS type, troponin level elevation, or coronary stenosis.Chest pain was the most common ACS symptom in both sexes. Although women were more likely to present without chest pain than men, absence of chest pain was not associated with markers of coronary disease severity. Strategies that explicitly incorporate assessment of common non-chest pain symptoms need to be evaluated."mycardial	MANAG	"Women with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) tend to have longer treatment delays than men. This may partly be due to women delaying calling for help, difficulties for the emergency medical communication (EMC) service in interpreting a different constellation of presenting symptoms than men, or gender-specific ambulance delays due to differences in the management by the EMC service.We studied the EMC audio logs and medical records of 244 consecutive STEMI patients (65 women and 179 men) who contacted the EMC center at a single hospital directly. Patient demographics, clinical findings, and outcome after primary percutaneous coronary intervention were similar for the 2 genders. More women than men reported chest discomfort and discomfort in other areas of the upper body as debuting symptoms. The combined effects of longer patients delay and system delay led to longer total ischemic time in women (total ischemic time: median [interquartile range] 142 [180] vs 135 [83] minutes, women vs men, P = .024). Despite similar presentation, women had lower priority for emergent ambulance service (78.7% and 89.4% of women vs men, P = .035). Lower priority for ambulance service was associated with longer total ischemic time.Despite similar presentation and clinical findings, women with STEMI were given significantly lower priority for emergent ambulance service than men."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To identify sex differences in risk factors, presenting symptoms and outcomes of young patients with acute myocardial infarction.We adopted a comprehensive approach and performed two parallel studies: (1) using provincial administrative databases from Quebec, Canada from 2000 to 2007, we identified baseline characteristics and post-acute myocardial infarction survival of patients aged < 50 years (n = 10,619); (2) to overcome the lack of clinical data in the administrative databases, a medical chart review was performed on 215 patients < 50 years of age with an acute myocardial infarction between April 2000 and August 2006 from our institution.Administrative cohort: fewer women than men sought medical attention for retrosternal chest pain 1-month pre-acute myocardial infarction (P = 0.035). Diabetes and hypertension were more prevalent in women, and patients equally received interventional procedures post-infarction. Diabetes significantly reduced post-infarction survival in men and women [HR = 2.02 (95% CI 1.21-3.36) and HR = 2.25 (95% CI 1.06-4.80), respectively]. However, young women had greater post-infarction mortality in-hospital and up to 1 year after discharge (4.23% vs. 2.21%, respectively; P = 0.005). Medical chart review: diabetes and hypertension were more prevalent in women, while men were more obese. There were no significant sex differences in typical presenting symptoms, or in interventional procedures post-infarction.Young men and women with acute myocardial infarctions equally presented with retrosternal chest pain, although fewer women sought medical attention for retrosternal chest pain before admission. Diabetes and hypertension were more prevalent in young women, and mortality was higher in young female patients. Our results highlight the continued need for diabetes prevention and control in young patients, especially women."mycardial	CLIN	"Besides different risk profiles for cardiovascular events in men and women, several studies reported gender differences in mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). As infarct size has been shown to correlate with mortality, it is widely accepted as surrogate marker for clinical outcome. Currently, cardiovascular imaging studies covering the issue of gender differences are rare. As magnetic resonance scar characterization parameters are emerging as additional prognostic factors after acute myocardial infarction, we sought to evaluate gender differences in CMR infarct characteristics in patients after acute myocardial infarction. We prospectively analyzed patients (n = 448) with AMI and primary angioplasty, who underwent contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging on a 1.5 T scanner in median 5 [4, 6] days after the acute event. [corrected]. CMR scar size was measured 15 min after gadolinium injection. In addition presence and extent of microvascular obstruction (MVO) was assessed. A matched pair analysis was performed in order to exclude confounding by gender related co-morbidities and gender differences in established clinical risk factors. Matching process according to clinical risk defined by GRACE score resulted in 93 mixed gender couples. Women were significantly older than men (64.4 Â± 11.9 vs. 60.5 Â± 12.3, p = 0.03) and presented with a significantly better ejection fraction before angioplasty (48.9 Â± 8.4 vs. 46.2 Â± 8.9, p = 0.04). Infarct size did not differ significantly between women and men (13.5 Â± 10.7 vs. 15.1 Â± 11.8, p = 0.32). Size of MVO was significantly smaller in women than in men (0.48 Â± 1.3 vs. 1.2 Â± 3.0, p = 0.03). Comparing scar characterization between women and men with similar risk profiles revealed no gender differences in scar size. Size of MVO, however, was significantly smaller in women and might reflect better cardioprotective mechanisms in women. Whether these changes have prognostic implications has to be tested on a larger patient population."mycardial	MANAG	"We evaluate sex-based differences in the effectiveness of early cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) and standard emergency department (ED) evaluation in patients with acute chest pain.In the Rule-Out Myocardial Infarction With Computer-Assisted Tomography (ROMICAT)-II multicenter, controlled trial, we randomized 1000 patients (47% women) 40 to 74 years of age with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome to an early CCTA or standard ED evaluation. In this prespecified analysis, women in the CCTA arm had a greater reduction in length of stay, lower hospital admission rates, and lesser increased cumulative radiation dose than men in a comparison of ED strategies (P for interaction â‰¤0.02). Although women had lower acute coronary syndrome rates than men (3% versus 12%; P<0.0001), sex differences in length of stay persisted after adjustment for baseline differences, including acute coronary syndrome rate (P for interaction <0.03). Length of stay was similar between sexes with normal CCTA findings (P=0.11). There was no missed acute coronary syndrome for either sex. No difference was observed in major adverse cardiac events between sexes and ED strategies (P for interaction =0.39). Women had more normal CCTA examinations than men (58% versus 37%; P<0.0001), less obstructive coronary disease by CCTA (5% versus 17%; P=0.0001), but similar normalcy rates for functional testing (P=0.65). Men in the CCTA arm had the highest rate of invasive coronary angiography (18%), whereas women had comparable low 5% rates regardless of ED strategy.This trial provides data supporting an early CCTA strategy as an attractive option in women presenting to the ED with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. The findings may be explained by lower CAD prevalence and severity in women than men."mycardial	CLIN	"Sex differences in the management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) have not been well studied.We examined mortality and revascularization rates of 9750 patients with CS between 1992 and 2008 in the Ontario Myocardial Infarction Database. Men and women were compared in the entire cohort and in subgroups divided by age (aged < 75 years vs aged â‰¥ 75 years) and revascularization availability at presenting hospital. Logistic regression was used to determine the adjusted effect of sex on mortality and to determine predictors of revascularization.The incidence of CS was higher in women (3.7% of female vs 2.7% of male AMI patients; P < 0.001). Women with CS were older than men (mean age: 75.5 vs 71.1 years; P < 0.001) and less likely to present to revascularization-capable sites (16% vs 19.2%; P < 0.001). Unadjusted 1-year mortality rates were higher in women (80.3% vs 75.4%; P < 0.001). Women were less likely to be revascularized (12.6% vs 17.6%; P < 0.001) and less likely to be transferred when they presented to nonrevascularization sites (11.3% vs 14.2%; P < 0.001). The strongest predictor of revascularization was presentation to a revascularization-capable site (odds ratio, 17.69; P < 0.001). After regression adjustment, there were no significant differences in mortality or revascularization between the sexes.Women with CS are older than men with CS and are less likely to present to revascularization-capable sites. This accounts for the lower unadjusted revascularization rates among women compared with men. However, there are no significant sex-based differences in adjusted mortality rates."mycardial	CLIN	"To investigate changes in self-reported fatigue and depression from four months to two years following a myocardial infarction, as well as to explore gender differences, identify the incidence of fatigue without coexisting depression and finally predict health-related quality of life at a two-year follow-up.Depression and fatigue are associated with decreased health-related quality of life after myocardial infarction. Although there is a close relationship between fatigue and depression, it has been shown that symptoms of fatigue can occur without coexisting depression.Quantitative and longitudinal design.Participants (n = 155) were asked to complete the following questionnaires: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20) and the Short Form Survey (SF-36) following myocardial infarction (after four months and two years). Descriptive statistics, paired t-tests and multiple regressions were carried out.In the entire group, self-reported fatigue had decreased from four months to two years after myocardial infarction. After two years, 18% of respondents reported depression together with fatigue and 30% reported fatigued without depression. Women scored higher than men on the fatigue dimensions reduced activity, reduced motivation and mental fatigue. Moreover, the physical dimension of health-related quality of life two years after myocardial infarction was predicted by experienced general fatigue at four months.Fatigue with or without coexisting possible/probable depression remains as a significant symptom two years after myocardial infarction in nearly half of the entire group.Fatigue is a problem following myocardial infarction. Therefore, systematic screening and early identification of patients experiencing symptoms of depression and fatigue after myocardial infarction are important for suitable care planning. In contemporary coronary care, strategies aimed at relieving fatigue should be developed."mycardial	OUTC	"To evaluate whether gender differences in terms of up to 4-year outcome still persist within patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who uniformly underwent coronary revascularization, we performed a gender comparison in a large contemporary multicentre percutaneous intervention (PCI) registry.We retrospectively analyzed data from 18,351 patients with AMI, who underwent percutaneous coronary interventions (5093 women and 13,258 men) in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy between July 2002 and December 2007. Median follow-up was 1174 days.After propensity score adjustment, differences in gender-related mortality were not temporarily homogeneous: 30-day adjusted mortality was higher in women than in men [hazard ratio (HR): 1.40, P < 0.0001], whereas thereafter female gender showed a significantly lower mortality risk (HR: 0.84, P = 0.01). Notably, younger women (<50 years old) both in the acute and postacute period had more than 3.6 higher risk of mortality when compared with men, whereas older women, particularly after the first 30-day post AMI, had similar (50-80 years old) or even better (â‰¥ 80 years old) survival compared with men. Finally 1-month adjusted risk of heart failure and post PCI vascular complications requiring surgical treatment was higher in women while there was no detectable difference in terms of early and late AMI/unstable angina, stroke and angiographic stent thrombosis.In a contemporary large real-world AMI population treated with PCI, we found gender-related temporal and age-dependent adjusted differences in mortality. Our data suggest the hypothesis that biological gender-related differences could, in part, explain these findings."mycardial	OUTC	"Gender associations with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), remain inconsistent. Gender-specific data in the Saudi Project for Assessment of Coronary Events registry, launched in December 2005 and currently with 17 participating hospitals, were explored.A prospective multicenter study of patient with ACS in secondary and tertiary care centers in Saudi Arabia were included in this analysis.Patients enrolled from December 2005 until December 2007 included those presented to participating hospitals or transferred from non-registry hospitals. Summarized data were analyzed.Of 5061 patients, 1142 (23%) were women. Women were more frequently diagnosed with non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI [43%]) than unstable angina (UA [29%]) or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI [29%]). More men had STEMI (42%) than NSTEMI (37%) or UA (22%). Men were younger than women (57 vs 63 years) who had more diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. More men had a history of coronary artery disease. More women received angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and fewer had percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Gender differences in the subset of STEMI patients were similar to those in the entire cohort. However, gender differences in the subset of STEMI showed fewer women given b-blockers, and an insignificant PCI difference between genders. Thrombolysis rates between genders were similar. Overall, in-hospital mortality was significantly worse for women and, by ACS type, was significantly greater in women for STEMI and NSTEMI. However, after age adjustment there was no difference in mortality between men and women in patients with NSTEMI. The multivariate-adjusted (age, risk factors, treatments, door-to-needle time) STEMI gender mortality difference was not significant (OR=2.0, CI: 0.7-5.5; P=.14).These data are similar to other reported data. However, differences exist, and their explanation should be pursued to provide a valuable insight into understanding ACS and improving its management."mycardial	CLIN	"Several biologic and clinical factors contribute to the increased 30-day mortality and re-infarction rate in women with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Sex differences in cardiac hemodynamic parameters such as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) have not been examined and might play an important role. The objectives of the present study were to examine whether female sex is an independent determinant of PCWP during acute STEMI and whether an elevated PCWP contributes to all-cause 30-day mortality and re-infarction in women. The clinical, angiographic, and hemodynamic features of 470 consecutive patients with STEMI (nÂ = 135 women) undergoing emergency coronary angiography with right-side heart catheterization were evaluated with respect to sex. Women had an elevated PCWP (20 Â± 8 vs 16 Â± 7 mm Hg, p <0.001) and reduced mixed venous oxygen saturation (67 Â± 11% vs 71 Â± 9%, pÂ = 0.004). On multivariate analysis, female sex (Î²Â = 4.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.04 to 6.04, p <0.001), hypertension (Î²Â = 2.07, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.83, pÂ = 0.021), and creatine kinase-estimated infarct size (Î²Â = 0.001, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.002, p â‰¤0.001) were independent predictors of an elevated PCWP. Female sex exerted a minor independent effect on 30-day mortality and re-infarction (odds ratio 2.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.46, pÂ = 0.008). However, once PCWP was entered into the mediation model, sex was no longer significant, suggesting that the effect of sex on the post-STEMI outcomes is potentially mediated through PCWP (odds ratio 1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.12, pÂ =Â 0.011). In conclusion, during acute STEMI, women have greater left ventricular filling pressures compared with men, independent of age, hypertension, and infarct size. The biologic explanation for this difference requires additional investigation, although it does not appear to contribute to the increased 30-day mortality and re-infarction rate observed in women. "mycardial	REVIEW	"Coronary artery disease was considered a male disease for many years. However, nowadays, coronary artery disease constitutes the leading cause of death in women, although there are a lot of gender-related differences regarding the presentation of acute myocardial infarction, its diagnosis, its treatment, short- and long-term mortality rates, and post-acute myocardial infarction complications. Generally, women have smaller and stiffer hearts and cardiac vessels, suffering a greater extent of atherosclerosis and endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction. They are usually older than men and they have more comorbidities such as hypertension, renal impairment, and diabetes mellitus. Moreover, female coronary artery disease, the diagnosis of which is more complicated due to more false negative results of some diagnostic methods in women, is more often presented with atypical symptoms and women's symptoms of typical or atypical angina are more severe. Furthermore, women delay significantly more in seeking care and they are more frequently undertreated. Finally, women are associated with generally poorer in-hospital and long-term prognosis having almost two-fold higher early mortality and they are more prone to complications such as bleeding complications, shock, and heart failure, as well as to post-myocardial infarction depression and poorer physical function and mental health. In this review, we discuss these sex-related differences according to current literature. "mycardial	CLIN	"Concerns have been raised about possible gender disparities in cardiac investigations and/or outcome. This study sought to examine and compare the diagnostic and prognostic performance of selected cardiac biomarkers in women versus men.In a prospective, multicenter cohort of patients with acute chest pain cardiac troponin T (cTnT) (fourth-generation Roche assay), high-sensitivity cTnT (hs-cTnT), and copeptin were measured at presentation.Of 1,247 patients, 420 were women and 827 were men. Although the rate of acute myocardial infarction was similar in women (14.5%) and men (16.6%, P = .351), women more frequently had cardiac but noncoronary causes of chest pain (17.4% vs 10.8%, P = .001) and less frequently had unstable angina (8.8% vs 16.6%, P = .002) than men. Diagnostic accuracy as quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for acute myocardial infarction in women was 0.90 (95% CI 0.84-0.95) for cTnT, which was lower than the AUC for hs-cTnT alone (0.94, 95% CI [0.91-0.98]), the combination of cTnT with copeptin (0.96, 95% CI [0.94-0.98]) or the combination of hs-cTnT with copeptin (0.96, 95% CI [0.93-0.98]) (P = .008, P = .006, and P = .002, respectively). Prognostic accuracy as quantified by the AUCs for 1-year mortality was 0.69 (0.56-0.83), 0.86 (0.79-0.93), 0.87 (0.81-0.94), and 0.87 (0.80-0.94), respectively. No relevant gender differences in AUCs were observed.The diagnostic and prognostic performance of cTnT, hs-cTnT, and copeptin is as good in women as in men. High-sensitivity cTnT and the combination of cTnT and copeptin outperform cTnT alone, both in women and men."mycardial	Management	"Calling 911 during acute coronary syndromes (ACS) decreases time to treatment and may improve prognosis. Women may have more atypical ACS symptoms compared to men, but few data are available on differences in gender and ACS symptoms in calling 911. In this study, patient interviews and structured chart reviews were conducted to determine gender differences in calling 911. Calls to 911 were assessed by self-report and validated by medical chart review. Of the 476 patients studied, 292 (61%) were diagnosed with unstable angina and 184 (39%) with myocardial infarctions (MIs). Overall, only 23% of patients called 911. Similar percentages of women and men with unstable angina called 911 (15% and 13%, respectively, p = 0.59). In contrast, women with MIs were significantly more likely to call 911 than men (57% vs 28%, p <0.001). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, health insurance status, history of MI, the left ventricular ejection fraction, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score, and ACS symptoms, women were 1.79 times more likely to call 911 during an MI than men (prevalence ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.22 to 2.64, p <0.01). In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that initiatives to increase calls to 911 are needed for women and men."mycardial	Clinical	"A growing body of evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may adversely affect the cardiovascular system. Therefore, we thought to prospectively assess the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the most commonly used index of vitamin D status, and incident coronary heart disease.We measured serum levels of 25[OH]D in 1783 healthy middle-aged subjects (964 men, 819 women) in the population-based Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease/Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg studies. A total of 298 coronary heart disease cases were identified over a mean follow-up period of 11 yr.After adjustment for age, survey, and season of blood sampling, the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval comparing tertile extremes of serum levels of 25[OH]D was 0.32 (0.16-0.65) (P for trend = 0.001) in women and 0.56 (0.38-0.82) (P for trend = 0.005) in men. Further adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors slightly attenuated the association in women [HR 0.39 (0.18-0.84); P for trend = 0.013], whereas it became nonsignificant in men [HR 0.76 (0.49-1.17); P for trend = 0.215]. After additional adjustment for C-reactive protein, IL-6, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and interferon-Î³-inducible protein-10, the association still remained significant in women [HR 0.42 (0.19-0.93); P for trend = 0.028], and it was further reduced in men [HR 0.84 (0.52-1.35); P for trend = 0.461].Our findings suggest that higher vitamin D levels are associated with decreased risk of coronary heart disease. This effect is more pronounced in women than in men. Further clinical and experimental studies are needed to investigate the sex differences and whether vitamin D supplementation could contribute to the prevention of coronary heart disease."mycardial	Management	"Numerous reports of gender differences in the management and mortality of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients have raised concerns on gender inequity in cardiac care. However, no study has explored whether gender disparity exists among health professionals and their relatives. Therefore, this study assesses gender disparity in the management and mortality of AMI patients in Taiwan, and determines whether such disparity exists among health professionals and their relatives. National Health Insurance (NHI) files were used to obtain information on a cohort of 79,360 AMI patients aged 30-85 years in Taiwan from 1997 to 2007. The use of catheterization and revascularization (CATH/RAVS) and one-year mortality were compared between men and women in all adult patients, health professionals and their relatives, and non-health professional patients. Taiwanese women with AMI were significantly less likely than their male counterparts to receive CATH/RAVS, and showed greater one-year mortality. Similarly, women in the professional group were significantly less likely to receive CATH/RAVS. However, they did not have worse survival outcomes (hazard ratio: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.68-1.50) compared to men. Regarding mortality following CATH/RAVS, no gender disparities against women were observed in health professionals and their relatives, whereas significant gender disparities persisted in non-health professional patients. In conclusion, this study shows a substantial gender disparity against women in the management and one-year survival of AMI patients in Taiwan. This research extends earlier studies by showing similar gender gaps in treatment uses among health professionals and their relatives without strong evidence on gender disparities against women in survival."mycardial	EPI	"To investigate treatment-seeking delays in Chinese patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to compare sex differences in this behaviour.A descriptive cross-sectional study was undertaken in patients with AMI, admitted to one of three hospitals in Shanghai, China. A treatment-seeking behaviour questionnaire was administered to each patient within 48 h of hospital admission.In total, 250 patients were included: 159 men and 91 women. The median time for patients with AMI to make a treatment-seeking decision was 130 min. Women took significantly longer to seek treatment than men (240 min versus 120 min). The majority of patients (70.8%) took >1 h to decide to seek treatment. The emergency medical service (EMS) was used by 77 (30.8%) of patients, and these patients had a significantly shorter prehospital delay time than those who transported themselves to hospital. Predictive factors for using the EMS were pain level and rating AMI symptoms as severe.Chinese patients with AMI had a significant prehospital delay time and women took longer than men to seek treatment. Public awareness of the importance of seeking immediate medical assistance for AMI via the EMS needs to be increased in China."mycardial	CLIN	"Sex-specific differences affect the evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of coronary artery disease. We tested the hypothesis that long-term outcomes of fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are different between women and men.Consecutive 1090 patients, referred for PCI and undergoing FFR measurements at the Mayo Clinic between October 2002 and December 2009, were included in this registry study. Clinical events were compared between the sexes during a median follow-up of 50.9 months. Of all patients, women had higher FFR adjusted by visual coronary stenosis than men (P=0.03). The Kaplan-Meier percent of major adverse cardiac events at 5 years was 35% in women and 38% in men (P=0.54). Interestingly, in patients undergoing PCI with an FFR <0.75, the incidence of death or myocardial infarction was significantly higher in women than in men (hazard ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-4.51; P=0.04). Moreover, compared with patients with FFR >0.80, deferral of PCI for those with FFR between 0.75 and 0.80 was associated with an increased rate of major adverse cardiac events, particularly death or myocardial infarction in women (hazard ratio, 3.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-6.74; P=0.002) and revascularization in men (hazard ratio, 2.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.66-4.54; P<0.001).Long-term outcome differs between women and men undergoing FFR-guided PCI. Our data suggest that the sex-based treatment strategy is necessary to further optimize prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease."mycardial	MANAG	"This study examined clinical factors associated with sex differences in the use of acute reperfusion therapy (fibrinolysis or primary percutaneous coronary intervention) in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, and the interaction between sex and these factors in Sweden and Canada.Patients with STEMI in Sweden (n=32,676 from the Register of Information and Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive Care Admissions) were compared with similar patients in Canada (n=3375 from the Canadian Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) for the period 2004-2008.Unadjusted vs. age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) for no reperfusion (women vs. men) were for Sweden 1.57 (95% CI 1.49-1.64) vs. 1.14 (95% CI 1.08-1.20), and for Canada 1.61 (95% CI 1.39-1.87) vs. OR 1.18 (95% CI 1.01-1.39). Sex differences persisted after multivariable adjustments (including prehospital delay, atypical symptoms, diabetes), factors for which no interaction with sex was found. Among women <60 years, adjusting for atypical symptoms in Canada and angiographic data in Sweden made the greatest contribution to explaining observed sex differences.In both countries, acute reperfusion therapy in STEMI was used less often in women than in men. Factors associated with these sex differences appear to differ between older and younger women. Targeted interventions are needed to optimize care for women with STEMI, as well as sex- and age-stratified reporting of quality indicators to assess their effectiveness."mycardial	OUTC	"Poorer outcomes in women with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are often attributed to gender differences in baseline characteristics. However, these may be age dependent. We examined the importance of gender in separate age groups of patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).Data of 6746 consecutive patients with STEMI admitted for PPCI between 1998 and 2008 in our hospital were evaluated. Age was stratified into two groups, <65 years (young group) and â‰¥65 years (elderly). Endpoints were enzymic infarct size as well as 30-day and 1 year mortality. We studied a total of 4991 (74.0%) men and 1755 (26.0%) women; 40% of women were <65 years and 60% of men were <65 years of age. In the elderly group (â‰¥65 years), women had more frequently diabetes and hypertension while they smoked less frequently than men. Younger women smoked more often than similarly aged men and had more hypertension. At angiography, single-vessel disease and TIMI 3 flow before PPCI was more present in younger women than men, whereas these differences were not found in the older age group. Patient delay before admission was shorter in men at all ages, while women had lower creatine kinase levels. Younger women had a higher mortality after 30 days (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4) and at 1 year (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.6), whereas in the older age group women mortality rates were higher at 30 days (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0) but not at 1 year (HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9-1.5). After multivariate analysis, 1-year mortality remained significantly higher in women at younger age (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.5). Patient delay before admission was shorter in men in both age groups. Creatine kinase levels were in both age groups higher in men.Differences in mortality between men and women with STEMI treated with PPCI are age dependent. Although young women have less obstructive coronary artery disease and more often TIMI 3 flow before PCI (suggesting a lower risk), survival was worse compared to similarly aged men. Women had a longer patient delay compared to men, but this was not related to gender-specific mortality."mycardial	OUTC	"Data on temporal trends in outcomes, gender differences, and adherence to evidence-based therapy (EBT) of diabetic patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are sparse.We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively acquired data on 3565 diabetic (2412 males and 1153 females) STEMI patients enrolled in the Swiss AMIS Plus registry between 1997 and 2010 and compared in-hospital outcomes and adherence to EBT with the nondiabetic population (n=15,531).In-hospital mortality dramatically decreased in diabetic patients, from 19.9% in 1997 to 9.0% in 2010 (p trend<0.001) with an age-adjusted decrease of 6% per year of admission. Similar trends were observed for age-adjusted reinfarction (OR 0.86, p<0.001), cardiogenic shock (OR 0.88, p<0.001), as well as death, reinfarction, or stroke (OR 0.92, p<0.001). However, the mortality benefit over time was observed in diabetic males (p trend=0.006) but not females (p trend=0.082). In addition, mortality remained twice as high in diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic ones (12.1 vs. 6.1%, p<0.001) and diabetes was identified as independent predictor of mortality (OR 1.23, p=0.022). Within the diabetic cohort, females had higher mortality than males (16.1 vs. 10.2%, p<0.001) and female gender independently predicted in-hospital mortality (OR 1.45, p=0.015). Adherence to EBT significantly improved over time in diabetic patients (p trend<0.001) but remained inferior - especially in women - to the one of nondiabetic individuals.In-hospital mortality and morbidity of diabetic STEMI patients in Switzerland improved dramatically over time but, compared with nondiabetic counterparts, gaps in outcomes as well as EBT use persisted, especially in women."mycardial	EPI	"Although the incidence of and mortality after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is decreasing, time trends in anatomical location of STEMI and associated short-term prognosis have not been examined in a population-based community study. We determined 22-year trends in age- and race-adjusted gender-specific incidences and 28-day case fatality of hospitalized STEMI by anatomic infarct location among a stratified random sample of 35- to 74-year-old residents of 4 communities in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. STEMI infarct location was assessed by 12-lead electrocardiograms from the hospital record and was coded as anterior, inferior, lateral, and multilocation STEMIs using the Minnesota code. From 1987 to 2008, a total of 4,845 patients had an incident STEMI; 37.2% were inferior STEMI, 32.8% were anterior, 16.8% occurred in multiple infarct locations, and 13.2% were lateral STEMI. For inferior, anterior, and lateral STEMIs in both men and women, significant decreases were observed in the age-adjusted annual incidence and the associated 28-day case fatality. In contrast, for STEMI in multiple infarct locations, neither the annual incidence nor the 28-day case fatality changed over time. The age- and race-adjusted annual incidence and associated 28-day case fatality of STEMI in anterior, inferior, and lateral infarct locations decreased during 22Â years of surveillance; however, no decrease was observed for STEMI in multiple infarct locations. In conclusion, our findings suggest that there is room for improvement in the care of patients with multilocation STEMI. "mycardial	OUTC	"The impact of gender on outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with second-generation drug-eluting stents is not known in Asian patients. The authors studied outcomes after PCI with zotarolimus-eluting stent in unselected consecutive series of Asian patients according to gender.Outcomes among patients treated with zotarolimus-eluting stents from multicenter registry were evaluated by gender. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events, composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularization at 1 year.Of 2,840 patients, 855 (30.1%) were women. Comparatively, women were older; more frequently had diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; less frequently women were current smokers, had previous myocardial infarctions and previous PCIs; were more likely to have culprit lesions in left anterior descending coronary artery; and underwent more multilesion PCIs. After adjustment for baseline differences, women were still at lower risk of major adverse cardiac events (38 [4.4%] versus 137 [6.9%], adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.89, P = 0.018), mainly driven by target lesion revascularization (24 [2.8%] versus 106 [5.3%], adjusted HR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.24-0.70, P = 0.001) at 1 year, although rates of cardiac death, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis were similar between genders. These results were consistent after propensity score-matched population analysis (for major adverse cardiac events, adjusted HR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.18-0.69, P = 0.012; for target lesion revascularization, adjusted HR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.15-0.69, P = 0.004) and were also constant among various high-risk subgroups.Despite greater baseline clinical and angiographic risk, the use of the zotarolimus-eluting stent is associated with favorable outcomes among Asian women treated with PCI."mycardial	EPI	"Active smoking is a well-established risk factor for myocardial infarction, but less is known about the impact of passive smoking, and possible sex differences in risk related to passive smoking. We investigated active and passive smoking as risk factors for myocardial infarction in an 11-year follow-up of 11,762 men and 13,206 women included in the TromsÃ¸ Study. There were a total of 769 and 453 incident cases of myocardial infarction in men and women, respectively. We found linear age-adjusted relationships between both active and passive smoking and myocardial infarction incidence in both sexes. The relationships seem to be stronger for women than for men. Age-adjusted analyses indicated a stronger relationship with passive smoking in ever-smokers than in never-smokers. After adjustment for important confounders (body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and physical activity) the associations with active and passive smoking were still statistically significant. Adjusting for active smoking when assessing the effect of passive smoking and vice versa, indicated that the effect of passive smoking in men may be explained by their own active smoking. In women, living with a smoker â‰¥30Â years after the age of 20 increased the myocardial infarction risk by 40Â %, even after adjusting for active smoking. Passive smoking is a risk factor for myocardial infarction on its own, but whereas the effect for men seems to be explained by their own active smoking, the effect in females remains statistically significant.

They are 9 years older than men on average, although 25% of women with STEMI are less than 60 years of age. Management of STEMI is similar, after adjustment for baseline characteristics. However, fewer women are treated with primary percutaneous coronary angioplasty. In NSTEMI, although use of coronary angiography is similar, fewer women get treated with angioplasty. Most medications are used in a similar way in men and women, except thienopyridines, with fewer women receive prasugrel. After adjustment, in-hospital mortality is similar for men and women.Myocardial infarction is not specific to men: one out of four patients admitted for myocardial infarction is a woman. Initial management is rather similar for men and women, after taking into account differences in baseline characteristics. Percutaneous coronary angioplasty, however, remains less frequently used in women. In-hospital complications have become rarer and do not differ according to sex."mycardial	CLIN	"Emergency management of myocardial infarction (MI) is time-critical, because improved patient outcomes are associated with reduced time from symptom onset to definitive care. Previous studies have identified that women are less likely to present with chest pain.We sought to measure the effect of sex on symptoms reported to the ambulance dispatch and ambulance times for MI patients.The Western Australia Emergency Department Information System (EDIS) was used to identify patients with emergency department (ED) diagnoses of MI (ST-segment elevation MI and non-ST-segment elevation MI) who arrived by ambulance between January 1, 2008, and October 31, 2009. Their emergency telephone calls to the ambulance service were transcribed to identify presenting symptoms. Ambulance data were used to examine ambulance times. Sex differences were analyzed using descriptive and age-adjusted regression analysis.Of 3,329 MI patients who presented to Perth EDs, 2,100 (63.1%) arrived by ambulance. After predefined exclusions, 1,681 emergency calls were analyzed. The women (n = 621; 36.9%) were older than the men (p < 0.001) and, even after age adjustment, were less likely to report chest pain (odds ratio [OR] = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57, 0.88). After age adjustment, ambulance times did not differ between the male and female patients with chest pain. The women with chest pain were less likely than the men with chest pain to be allocated a ""priority 1"" (lights and sirens) ambulance response (men 98.3% vs. women 95.5%; OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.18, 0.87).Ambulance dispatch officers (and paramedics) need to be aware of potential sex differences in MI presentation in order to ensure appropriate ambulance response."mycardial	CLIN	"Previous studies have shown a relation between female gender and adverse outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of this study was to determine whether there are differences in correlates between genders for these long-term adverse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Gender differences were evaluated in the clinical outcomes of 6,929 consecutive patients with acute coronary syndromes from a large, contemporary PCI registry. Rates of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization at 1-year follow-up, are reported. Independent correlates of adverse outcomes were identified using multivariate proportional-hazards regression analysis. Women were older (p <0.001); had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (p <0.001), systemic hypertension (p <0.001), chronic renal insufficiency (p = 0.02), peripheral arterial disease (p <0.001), and congestive heart failure (p <0.001); had lower body surface areas (p <0.001); and had higher body mass indexes (p <0.001). Acute coronary syndrome presentation in women tended to be unstable angina pectoris with Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III and IV symptoms, whereas men had more acute myocardial infarctions. At 1 year, the unadjusted rates of all-cause mortality (10.7% vs 7.5%, p <0.001) and major adverse cardiovascular events (16.4% vs 12.7%, p <0.001) were higher in women. There was a stark difference between the genders in independent correlates of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events at 1 year. Moreover, the traditional correlates did not have the same impact in women as in men. In conclusion, although there are differences in clinical outcomes after PCI for women compared with men, there are different correlates for these adverse outcomes. These gender-based differences should be taken into account when women undergo contemporary PCI."mycardial	CLIN	"Previous reports have shown that female gender is associated with impaired outcomes among patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated by thrombolysis, mainly owing to a worst risk profile (more diabetes, more advanced age, and higher Killip class at presentation) compared to men. Still contrasting are data on the effect of gender on the outcome in patients with STEMI undergoing primary angioplasty. In particular, it is still unclear whether a larger infarct size might contribute to the explanation of the worse outcome in women. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate gender-related differences in infarct size as evaluated by myocardial scintigraphy in a large cohort of patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We included 830 patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The infarct size was evaluated at 30 days using technetium-99m-sestamibi. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relation between gender and infarct size (as percentage of patients above the median) after correction for baseline confounding factors. We also evaluated the presence of a potential age-gender interaction. A total of 183 patients (20.8%) were women. Female gender was associated with more advanced age and a greater prevalence of hypertension; previous infarction and smoking were more frequently observed in men. Female gender was associated with a smaller infarct size (p <0.001) that was confirmed after correction for baseline confounding factors (adjusted odds ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.7, p <0.001). No age-gender interaction was observed (p = 0.13). In conclusion, the results of the present study have shown that despite the presence of high-risk features at presentation, female gender was associated with a smaller infarct size than that in men, without any interaction between age and gender."mycardial	MANAG	"Female sex independently predicts bleeding risk after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Bivalirudin is safer than abciximab plus heparin in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Thus, a greater benefit of bivalirudin in women would be expected.We performed a sex-based analysis of the patients with NSTEMI (n = 1,721, 399 women) enrolled in the ISAR-REACT 4 trial and randomized to receive bivalirudin or abciximab plus heparin. Main outcome was a 30-day composite of death, large recurrent myocardial infarction, urgent target vessel revascularization, or major bleeding. Secondary outcome was 1-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization.No difference in the main outcome was observed in groups with bivalirudin or abciximab plus heparin: 12.6% versus 15.5% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.48-1.37) among women and 10.6% versus 9.5% (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.77-1.64) among men. Major bleeding occurred in 4.5% in the bivalirudin group versus 7.5% in the abciximab plus heparin group (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.26-1.39) among women and 2.0% versus 3.8% (HR 0.52, 0.27-1.02) among men. At 1 year, the secondary outcome was observed in 24.1% in the bivalirudin group versus 28.7% in the abciximab plus heparin group among women, HR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.55-1.17), and in 20.6% and 19.0%, respectively, HR of 1.10 (95% CI 0.86-1.40) among men.Despite a higher peri-PCI bleeding risk in women, bivalirudin is as effective as and safer than abciximab plus heparin in women and men with NSTEMI undergoing PCI."mycardial	CLIN	"Optimal management of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) due to critical stenosis of an unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) is not established. However, data from observational studies and registries encourage to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in high risk patients. We investigated gender-related discrepancies, clinical course and prognosis in patients with acute MI and ULMCA as an infarct-related artery.A total of 643 consecutive patients (184 [28.6%] females and 459 [71.4%] males) with acute MI due to critical ULMCA stenosis were selected from the population of 121,526 patients hospitalized due to acute coronary syndromes between 2003 and 2006. The primary endpoints were in-hospital, 30-day, 6-month and 12-month mortality.Women were older than men with significantly higher proportion of women older than 65 and with unfavorable risk profile. The management in men and women was similar. There was no significant gender-related differences in mortality in all follow-up periods. In multivariate analysis cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and advanced age significantly increased mortality, whereas successful PCI decreased mortality.No significant differences in clinical course, treatment and prognosis between men and women were noted. Mortality remained very high in both genders. The most unfavorable prognostic factors were cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, STEMI and advanced age. Percutaneous coronary angioplasty is feasible and offers high success rate in this subset of patients."mycardial	2013	"Mortality in female patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary angioplasty (pPCI) is higher than in men. We examined gender differences in the prevalence and prognostic performance of renal dysfunction at admission in this setting.A multicenter retrospective sub-analysis of the Belgian STEMI-registry identified 1,638 patients (20.6% women, 79.4% men) treated with pPCI in 8 tertiary care hospitals (January 2007-February 2011). The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the CKD-EPI equation. Main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality.More women than men suffered from renal dysfunction at admission (42.3% vs. 25.3%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Mortality in women was doubled as compared to men (9.5 vs. 4.7%, OR (95% CI) = 2.12 (1.36-3.32), p<0.001). In-hospital mortality for men and women with vs. without renal dysfunction was much higher (10.7 and 15.3 vs. 2.3 and 2.4%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). In a multivariable regression analysis, adjusting for age, gender, peripheral artery disease (PAD), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, diabetes and low body weight (<67â€‰kg), female gender was associated with renal dysfunction at admission (OR (95% CI) 1.65 (1.20-2.25), pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). In a multivariable model including TIMI risk score and renal dysfunction, renal dysfunction was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in both men (OR (95% CI)â€‰=â€‰2.39 (1.27-4.51), pâ€‰=â€‰0.007) and women (OR (95% CI)â€‰=â€‰4.03 (1.26-12.92), pâ€‰=â€‰0.02), with a comparable impact for men and women (p for interactionâ€‰=â€‰0.69).Female gender was independently associated with renal dysfunction at admission in pPCI treated patients.

We analysed the impact of SCARB1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs5888 with plasma lipid profile and association with coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Lithuanian population characterized by high morbidity and mortality from CAD and high prevalence of hypercholesterolemia.The study included 1976 subjects from a random sample (reference group) and an myocardial infarction (MI) group of 463 patients. Genotyping of SCARB1 (rs5888) was carried out using the real-time polymerase chain reaction method.Analysis of rs5888 C/T gene polymorphism in the reference group revealed that male TT genotype carriers (25-74 years) had significantly higher total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations (5.70 mmol/l vs. 5.49 mmol/l; pâ€‰=â€‰0.036, and 1.70 mmol/l vs. 1.40 mmol/l, pâ€‰=â€‰0.023, respectively) than CT carriers and the oldest males (65-74 years) TT carriers had significantly higher high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in comparison to heterozygous (1.52 mmol/l vs. 1.36 mmol/l, pâ€‰=â€‰0.033). The youngest female (25-44 years) TT genotype carriers had significantly lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in comparison to C homozygous (2.59 mmol/l vs. 2.92 mmol/l, pâ€‰=â€‰0.023). The frequency of the SCARB1 TT genotype in the oldest male MI group (65-74 years) was significantly lower than in the corresponding reference group subjects (9.4% vs. 22.3%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.006). SCARB1 TT genotype was associated with decreased odds of MI in males aged 65-75 years (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.24, 95% CI 0.10-0.56, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001).SCARB1 polymorphism is associated with lipid metabolism and CAD in an age- and gender- dependent manner. Analysis of SCARB1 SNP rs5888 C/T genotypes revealed an atheroprotective phenotype of lipid profile in older men and in young women TT genotype carriers in the reference group. SCARB1 TT genotype was associated with decreased odds of MI in aged men."mycardial	MANAG	"â€‚Limited data are available for sex-based differences in Japanese patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).â€‚The study patients comprised 1,197 women and 3,182 men who underwent primary PCI for AMI in 2005-2007. Compared with the men, the women were significantly older, and had significantly longer onset-to-balloon time and lower rate of follow-up coronary angiography. In-hospital mortality was higher among women than men (8.7% vs. 4.9%, P<0.001). Although the cumulative incidence of all-cause death at 3 years was also higher for women (17.7% vs. 10.7%, P<0.001), the adjusted risk for all-cause death was comparable [hazard ratio (HR, women vs. men)=0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-1.24, P=0.66]. The incidence (12.1% vs. 12.4%, P=0.77) and the adjusted risk (HR=0.99, 95% CI 0.78-1.24, P=0.92) for any clinically-driven coronary revascularization were both comparable.

A longitudinal linear mixed effects model was fitted to the acute myocardial infarction hospitalization rates for the states and counties within each state to examine the overall temporal trend.There was a significant overall decrease in age-adjusted acute myocardial infarction hospitalization rates between 2000 and 2008, with most states showing over a 20% decline during the period. The ratio of male/female rates for acute myocardial infarction hospitalization rates remained relatively consistent over time, approximately two-fold higher in men compared to women. A large geographic variability was found for age-adjusted acute myocardial infarction hospitalization rates, with the highest rates found in the Northeastern states. Results of two ecological analyses revealed that the NE region remained significantly associated with increased AMI hospitalization rates after adjustment for socio-demographic factors.This investigation is one of the first to explore geographic differences in AMI age adjusted hospital rates in individuals 35+ years of age for 2000-2008. We showed a decreasing trend in AMI hospitalization rates in men and women. A large geographic variability in rates was found with particularly higher rates in the New England/Mid-Atlantic region of the US and lower rates in the mountain and Pacific states of the tracking network. It appeared that over time this disparity in rates became less notable."mycardial	EPI	"To assess whether gender differences exist in the clinical presentation, angiographic severity, management and outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).The study comprised of 1,961 women and 8,593 men who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and were included in the Malaysian NCVD-PCI Registry from 2007-2009. Significant stenosis was defined as â‰¥70% stenosis in at least one of the epicardial vessels.Women were significantly older and had significantly higher rates of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic renal failure, new onset angina and prior history of heart failure whereas smokers and past history of myocardial infarction were higher in men. In the ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) cohort, more women were in Killip class III-IV, had longer door-to-balloon time (169.5 min. vs 127.3 min, p<0.052) and significantly longer transfer time (300.4 min vs 166.3 min, p<0.039). Overall, women had significantly more left main stem (LMS) disease (1.3% vs 0.6%, p<0.003) and smaller diameter vessels (<3.0 mm: 45.5% vs 34.8%, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality rates for all PCI, STEMI, Non-STEMI (NSTEMI) and unstable angina for women and men were 1.99% vs 0.98%, Odds ratio (OR): 2.06 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.40 to 3.01), 6.19% vs 2.88%, OR: 2.23 (95% CI: 1.31 to 3.79), 2.90% vs 0.79%, OR: 3.75 (95% CI: 1.58 to 8.90) and 1.79% vs 0.29%, OR: 6.18 (95% CI: 0.56 to 68.83), respectively.

In-hospital and six-month mortality for all PCI, STEMI and NSTEMI were higher due largely to significantly more LMS disease, smaller diameter vessels, longer door-to-balloon and transfer time in women."mycardial	OUTC	"We selected all case histories of patients living in the area served by the Syktyvkar policlinic #3 and treated in Republican Cardiological Dispensary in 2003-2009 with diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). Data on survival of patients after MI (mean duration of follow-up 4.6 years) was derived from information on date and cause of death of patients obtained from statistical office of the policlinic. Overall we analyzed data on 778 patients (46.3% women, mean age 63.7 years). For detection of independent factors related to lethal outcome we used binary logistic regression, for assessment of survival we used Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model of proportional hazards. From positions of gender differences we assessed pharmacoepidemiology of MI, efficacy of thrombolytic therapy, determined factors of hospital and long term mortality. No increase of risk of hospital or long term mortality associated with female sex was revealed by multifactorial analysis. Greatest prognostic significance in relation to unfavorable outcome irrespective of patients sex was established for the following factors: age, severity of MI course, severity of renal dysfunction. In acute period of MI in addition to these factors we revealed unfavorable influence of hyperglycemia and protective role of preceding hypertensive disease. "mycardial	OUTC	"Females with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have a higher risk of adverse outcomes because of receiving less evidence-based medical care. Our aim was to investigate the gender disparity in early death after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the current era.A total of 1429 consecutive patients with STEMI in the Liaoning district were analyzed. We compared hospital care and cardiac event data by sex for in-patients with acute STEMI within 24 hours of symptom onset.In the emergency reperfusion group (n = 754), in-hospital mortality occurred in 4.2% of the males and 11.2% of the females (P = 0.001). In the non-emergency reperfusion group (n = 675), in-hospital mortality occurred in 13.0% of the males and 22.9% of the females (P = 0.001). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis revealed female sex as an independent risk factor of death for STEMI patients during hospitalization (OR = 1.691, P = 0.007). After controlling for patients who died within 24 hr after admission, female sex was no longer an independent risk factor (OR = 1.409, P = 0.259).Female sex was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality of STEMI patients, which is explained by an excess of very early deaths."mycardial	OUTC	"â€‚Although previous randomized and non-randomized studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES), a higher revascularization rate has been reported in women than in men. A sub-analysis of the TAXUS Japan Post-market Surveillance Study (TAXUS-PMS) was done to assess the influence of gender on clinical outcome.â€‚A total of 2,132 PES-treated Japanese patients (women, n=551) from this registry were analyzed. Subjects were stratified by gender to compare 1-year clinical outcome. PES-treated women were older and more likely to have insulin-treated diabetes and hypertension. In contrast, PES-treated men were more likely to be smokers, have a previous history of myocardial infarction, and lower ejection fraction. While cardiac death, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis were similar between men and women, major cardiac events tended to be lower in women than in men (6.4% vs. 8.8%, P=0.08). Although women had significantly smaller reference vessel size (2.46Â±0.53 mm vs. 2.59Â±0.60 mm, P<0.0001), the restenosis rate tended to be lower in women than in men (11.5% vs. 14.8%, P=0.11). Subsequently, the target lesion revascularization rate was significantly lower in women than in men (4.2% vs. 6.5%, P<0.05).â€‚Despite a higher risk profile, Japanese women treated with PES did not have a higher rate of repeat revascularization or major adverse clinical outcome than PES-treated men at 1 year.â€‚"mycardial	Clinical	"There are only very few data on gender differences in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction.To compare the clinical data and prognosis of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the Hungarian Myocardial Infarction Registry database.Between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2011 4981 patients (3038 men) were included in the database.Women were significantly older (67.7Â±13.5 vs. 60.5Â±12.5 years; p<0.001). Hypertension, diabetes, and stroke were more frequent among women, whereas smoking and previous myocardial infarction were found more often among men. Percutaneous coronary intervention was significantly more frequently performed in men than in women (82.4% vs. 75.3%; p<0.001), and the time between the onset of pain and arrival of patients to the site of percutaneous coronary intervention was longer in women than in men. Hospital mortality was higher among women than men (7.5% vs. 4.4%; p<0.001).At present women have a poorer hospital outcome than men. By increasing the revascularization treatment ratio in women an improvement may be achieved in the prognosis."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"The physiological mechanisms contributing to sex differences following myocardial infarction (MI) are poorly understood. Given the strong relationship between sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and outcome, we hypothesized there may be a sex difference in SNA responses to MI. In anaesthetized, open-chest male, female and ovariectomized (OVX) female Wistar rats, mean arterial pressure, heart rate and renal SNA were recorded in response to ligation of the left coronary artery. In males, renal SNA increased by 30 Â± 6% in the first minute of coronary occlusion (P < 0.05) and remained elevated at 18 Â± 7% above baseline (P < 0.05) at 2 h following MI. In response to MI, ovary-intact females displayed no change in renal SNA, whereas OVX females displayed a significant increase, similar to that seen in the males (increases of 43 Â± 11% at 1 min and 21 Â± 7% at 2 h post-MI, P < 0.05 versus intact females). Arterial baroreflex control of renal SNA had a smaller range in females (ovary intact and OVX) than males; no changes in arterial baroreflex responses were observed 1 h post-MI in males or females. Denervating the arterial baroreceptors abolished the renal SNA response to MI in the males, whereas in ovary-intact females and OVX females the response was unaltered. These findings suggest that ovarian hormones are able to blunt the initial sympathetic activation post-MI in females and that the importance of the arterial baroreflex in mediating initial sympathetic activation post-MI is different between the sexes."mycardial	Outcomes	"We sought to better define the impact of sex on 'in-hospital outcomes' after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or stenting (CAS).Hospital discharge databases for all carotid interventions obtained from the New York State (NYS) Department of Health, Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System between 2000 and 2009 (29,917 women, 39,771 men) were analysed. Mortality, stroke and composite event (stroke/death) were compared between procedures after matching of patients by propensity score. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was our secondary 'end' point.More than 90% of patients in both sexes were asymptomatic (27,439 women and 36,295 men). Compared to men, asymptomatic women experienced more strokes after CEA (women: 1.38%, men: 1.16%, P = 0.03) and higher AMI rates after both procedures (CEA; women: 0.75%, men: 0.51%, P = 0.0009, CAS; women: 0.96%, men: 0.28%, P = 0.01). Between procedures, symptomatic women undergoing CAS showed higher rates of mortality (CAS: 4.19%, CEA: 0.47%, P = 0.01) and combined (stroke/mortality) events (CAS: 12.09%, CEA: 6.05%, P = 0.02). In all other cohorts, no statistically significant difference was found between the procedures.Compared to CEA, CAS led to inferior in-hospital outcomes only in symptomatic women in the last decade in NYS. Men and asymptomatic women showed comparable outcomes after both procedures, whereas asymptomatic females were more prone to AMI after both interventions. These sex-associated differences should be taken into account for the treatment of carotid artery disease."mycardial	Epidemiology	"The French-speaking Community of Belgium has set up a register of ischaemic cardiopathies (1983-2007). The aim consists in analyzing the evolution of fatal and non-fatal acute coronary events rates as well as the 28 days case fatality on a 25-year period and examine sex differences in lethality.This register assures a standardized procedure according to the MONICA criteria. For each period, we present attack rates and trends analysis. Hospital lethality takes again in-patients and community lethality is calculated starting from all the cases.The total attack rate is rather stable between 1983 and 2007 for women (from 12 to 19 per 10,000 residents). For men, there is a distinct decline of the total attack rate since 1991 till 1993 (63 to 43 per 10,000 residents). We systematically observe a reduction in risk between men and women according to the age. For each 5-year period, this risk decreases significantly with age and this difference is strongest during the periods 1993-1997 and 1998-2002. The analysis shows also a significant decline in lethality between the 1983-1987 and 1993-1997 periods. Among women, lethality is systematically higher than in men in spite of the presence or the absence of antecedents of myocardial infarction.Favourable evolutions in the attack rates of acute coronary events in the study population appear clearly on the 25-year period of observation. The whole lethality rates decreased during the first 15 years of the register; after that, it stabilized."mycardial	Management	"In recent years epidemiological and clinical evidence has shown gender disparities in several aspects of cardiovascular disease. Aim of this study was to identify gender differences in the clinical profile and management of patients admitted to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs.Patients enrolled in the ISYDE-2008 survey were considered.The ISYDE-2008 survey enrolled 2281 patients; 604 (26.5%) were women. Compared to men, women were older (mean age 70.8 Â± 11.5 versus men's 65.6 Â± 11.5 years), had less traditional risk factors (low cardiovascular risk profile in 45.3% of women and 38.0% of men, p=0.003), were more frequently admitted after valvular surgery and heart failure, but less for post-acute myocardial infarction and post-by-pass procedure. Women were more frequently admitted to an in-hospital rehabilitation program. Women showed a more complicated acute and rehabilitative course, with 63.2% of them having at least one complication during acute-phase, compared to 52.5% of men, and 48.3% during rehabilitation, compared to 35.0% of men (p<0.0001). During rehabilitation, women underwent exercise tests less frequently, except for the 6-minute walking test. At discharge, women received ACE-inhibitors/ARBs, Î²-blockers, statins, omega-3 fatty acids, antiplatelet agents less frequently, but more frequently digoxin, amiodarone, diuretics, oral anticoagulants, insulin and anti-depressive drugs. The duration of the rehabilitation program was longer for women. Mortality was very low in the entire population.Women are less frequently admitted to CR than men. They are older and show a greater cardiovascular burden. Women are more likely to be enrolled in CR after valvular surgery and heart failure than men."mycardial	Outcomes	"Conflicting evidence exists on sex-based outcomes after coronary stenting.Data on 426 996 patients â‰¥65 years old (42.3% women) from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry (2004-2008) were linked to Medicare inpatient claims to compare in-hospital outcomes by sex and long-term outcomes by sex and stent type. In-hospital complications were more frequent in women than in men: death (3869 [2.2%] versus 3737 [1.6%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-1.49), myocardial infarction (2365 [1.3%] versus 2858 [1.2%]; odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.27), bleeding (7860 [4.4%] versus 5627 [2.3%]; odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.79-1.93), and vascular complications (2381 [1.3%] versus 1648 [0.7%]; odds ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.73-1.99). At 20.4 months, women had a lower adjusted risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90-0.94) but similar rates of myocardial infarction, revascularization, and bleeding. Relative to bare metal stent use, drug-eluting stent use was associated with similar improved long-term outcomes in both sexes: death (women: adjusted HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.76-0.81; men: HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.74-0.79), myocardial infarction (women: HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.74-0.84; men: HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77-0.85), and revascularization (women: HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97; men: HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.94). There was no interaction between sex and stent type for long-term outcomes.In contemporary coronary stenting, women have a slightly higher procedural risk than men but have better long-term survival. In both sexes, use of a drug-eluting stent is associated with lower long-term likelihood for death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization."mycardial	Outcomes	"We aimed to study sex-related differences in temporal trends in short- and long-term mortality from 1985 to 2008 in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction.We included a total of 14 434 consecutive patients admitted to our intensive coronary care unit between 1985 and 2008 for myocardial infarction. A total of 4028 patients (28%) were women. Women were more likely to present with a higher risk profile and were equally likely to receive pharmacological and invasive reperfusion therapy compared with men. Women had a higher unadjusted mortality rate at 30 days (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.5) and during 20 years (hazard ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.2) of follow-up. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, 30-day mortality was equal (adjusted odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-1.2) but the hazard for 20-year mortality was lower (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.90) in women compared to men. For 30-day mortality, there was no significant interaction between sex and age, diagnosis, or diabetes mellitus. Survival improved between 1985 and 2008. Temporal mortality reductions between 1985 and 2008 were at least as high in women as in men with myocardial infarction for both 30-day mortality and long-term mortality hazard.The fact that adjusted mortality rates for men and women treated for myocardial infarction in an intensive coronary care unit were similar and declined markedly over a 24-year period suggests that both sexes benefit from the evidence-based therapies that have been developed and implemented during this time period."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Although the mortality of coronary heart disease (CHD) has declined in Western countries during the last decades, studies have suggested that the prevention and treatment of CHD may not have been as effective in women as in men.

Suspected coronary events were adjudicated by a review of hospital records and death certificates. A total of 1669 events fulfilled standardized criteria of first-ever fatal or non-fatal MI.In the age group 35-79 years, the age-adjusted incidence of MI declined significantly in men, whereas an increase was observed in women. For men and women â‰¥ 80 years the incidence rates remained unchanged. The severity of MI and the 28-day and 1-year case fatality rates declined significantly and similarly in men and women.Trends in MI incidence differed by sex and age; in the age group 35-79 years a marked decrease was observed among men but an increase was observed among women, while no change was observed among older patients. MI severity and case fatality were clearly reduced for both sexes. These data suggest that the burden of CHD is shifting from middle-aged men toward middle-aged women and elderly patients."mycardial	Outcomes	"Young patients (agedâ‰¤45 years) presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction present unique challenges.

The cohort was divided into those aged 45 years or less and those aged more than 45 years.Young patients accounted for 10.3% of all ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction cases. Compared with older patients, younger patients were less likely to have traditional cardiovascular risk factors and had similar or better quality/performance measures with lower in-hospital mortality (unadjusted rate 1.6 vs 6.5%, P<.0001; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.46). Time trend analysis (2002-2008) suggested an increase over time in the ""all or none"" composite performance measure in both the younger and older patients (68%-97% and 69%-96%, respectively). However, there was significantly lower quality of care and worse outcomes in women (vs men) and in the very young (â‰¤35 vs 36-45 years). Significant interaction was seen between age and gender for in-hospital death, such that the gender difference was greater in the younger cohort. Similar interaction was seen for door-to-thrombolytic time such that the gender delay was greater in the younger cohort (women:men ratio of means=1.73, 95% CI, 1.21-2.45 [younger] vs 1.08, 95% CI, 1.00-1.18 [older]; P(interaction)=.0031).Young patients aged 45 years or less presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction overall had similar quality of care and in-hospital outcomes as older counterparts. However, quality of care was significantly lower and mortality was higher in young women (vs young men) and the very young (â‰¤35 vs 36-45 years)."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Smoking is one of the most important risk factors for myocardial infarction. Smokers usually suffer their first myocardial infarction earlier in life compared to non-smokers. This age difference seems to be greater in women than in men. The aim of this study was to examine the age and sex differences in terms of smoking in patients with first myocardial infarction who were enrolled in the Swiss National Registry of myocardial infarction, AMIS Plus.Data of 15,711 patients admitted to an AMIS Plus hospital between 1999 and 2008 with a first myocardial infarction were analysed. Several multivariate regression, interaction and sensitivity analyses were conducted.The mean age at first myocardial infarction was 68.5 Â± 12.2 years for non-smokers and 56.6 Â± 11.7 years for smokers (P < 0.001). After stratification by sex the difference between non-smokers and smokers was 10.2 years in men and 13.1 years in women. Even after adjustment for risk factors (overweight, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes), comorbidities (peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease), regular cardiovascular medication intake before admission, Killip classification and ECG on admission, male smokers were 8.7 years younger than male non-smokers at first myocardial infarction. In women, the age difference between smokers and non-smokers was 10.8 years, giving a sex-specific difference of 2.1 years (P < 0.001).In the AMIS Plus cohort, smoking was associated with younger age at first myocardial infarction and this was much more pronounced in women. Public health campaigns should take into account the impact of smoking on premature first myocardial infarction, especially in women."mycardial	Management	"Many reports suggest gender disparity in cardiac care as a contributor to the increased mortality among women with heart disease.We sought to identify gender differences in the management of Myocardial Infarction (MI) Alert-activated ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients that may have resulted from prehospital initiation.A retrospective database was created for MI Alert STEMI patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) of an academic community hospital with 74,000 annual visits from April 2000 through December 2008. Included were patients meeting criteria for an MI Alert (an institutional clinical practice guideline designed to expedite cardiac catheterization for STEMI patients). Data points (before and after initiation of a prehospital alert protocol) were compared and used as markers of therapy: time to ECG, receiving Î²-blockers, and time to the catheterization laboratory (cath lab). Differences in categorical variables by patient sex were assessed using the Ï‡(2) test. Medians were estimated as the measure of central tendency. Quantile regression models were used to assess differences in median times between subgroups.A total of 1231 MI Alert charts were identified and analyzed. The majority of the study population were male (70%), arrived at the ED via ambulance (60.1%), and were taking a Î²-blocker (67.8%) or aspirin (91.6%) at the time of the ED admission. Female patients were more likely than male patients to arrive at the ED via ambulance (65.9% vs 57.6%, respectively; P = 0.014). The median age of female patients was 68 years, whereas male patients were significantly younger (median age, 59 years; P < 0.001). The proportion of patients currently taking a Î²-blocker or low-dose aspirin did not vary by gender. Overall, 78.2% of the MI Alert patients arriving at the ED were MI2 (alert initiated by ED physician), and this did not vary by gender (P = 0.33). A total of 1064 MI Alert patients went to the cath lab: 766 male patients (88.9%) and 298 female patients (80.8%). Overall, the median time to cath lab arrival was 79 minutes for men and 81 minutes for women (P = 0.38). Overall, the median time to cath lab arrival significantly decreased from MI1 to MI3, (P(trend) < 0.001). For prehospital-initiated alerts (MI3), the median time to cath lab arrival was the same for men and women (64 minutes; P = 1.0). For hospital-initiated alerts, time to cath lab arrival was 82 minutes for male patients and 84 minutes for female patients (P = 0.38). Prehospital activation of the process decreased the time to the cath lab by 19 minutes (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 13.2-24.8).No significant gender differences were apparent in the STEMI patients analyzed, whether the MI Alert was initiated in the ED or prehospital initiated. Initiating prehospital-based alerts significantly decreased the time to the cath lab."mycardial	CLIN	"There is conflicting evidence on the impact of gender on reperfusion after primary coronary angioplasty (PPCI), and on left ventricular (LV) remodelling (LVR). In a cohort of patients with reperfused ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), gender-related differences on myocardial reperfusion, and sex-related differences on LVR were assessed by using a comprehensive cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) approach.In four tertiary referral centres, 283 (238 males and 45 females) consecutive STEMI patients, treated with PPCI within 12 h from symptoms onset underwent CMR 3 Â± 2 days after STEMI and at 4-month follow-up. By CMR, the area at risk, infarct size (IS), microvascular obstruction (MVO), and myocardial salvage index (MSI) were assessed. Women were older than men (P = 0.014), more hypertensive (P < 0.001) and more frequently presented with pre-infarct angina (P = 0.018). An MSI extent was significantly higher (P = 0.013), IS was significantly smaller at both time points (acute P < 0.001, follow-up P < 0.001), and the MVO extent was significantly smaller (P < 0.001) in women. At multivariate analysis, Killip class and female sex were independently associated with a higher MSI (P = 0.02, P = 0.05, respectively). A similar incidence of LVR in both sexes was observed at follow-up (P = 0.808).The better reperfusion pattern observed in women by CMR in our population of reperfused STEMI suggests sex-based differences exist. No gender differences were observed with respect to incidence of LV remodelling at the follow-up mainly occurring in the subset of patients with a larger IS."mycardial	REVIEW	"Gender-specific data focused on cardiovascular disease (CVD) are becoming increasingly available. This is of great importance, given that CVD has become the number 1 killer of women, and unlike for men, mortality rates do not seem to be declining. Many factors are cited as the causes of sex-based differences, including delays in recognizing symptoms, underutilization of diagnostic tests and treatments, as well as anatomic, physiological, and genetic factors. Evidence of fundamental biological differences in vascular function and the underlying pathologic processes is only beginning to elucidated, motivated by growing evidence of differences in clinical presentations and outcomes between men and women. The good news is that we are starting to see improvements in outcomes for women, such as after coronary revascularization; decrease in complication rates with the advent of new techniques, such as radial access for cardiac catheterizations; as well as increased participation of women in clinical trials. The underlying mechanisms of ischemic heart disease remain to be elucidated, and will help guide therapy and ultimately may explain the higher prevalence of : subendocardial myocardial infarctions, spontaneous arterial dissections, plaque erosion, increased vasospastic disorders, such as coronary microvascular disease, and pulmonary hypertension in women compared with men. We have made great progress in understanding gender-related differences in CVDs, but much remains to be done to optimize the prevention of CVD for both men and women."mycardial	EPI	"Women with myocardial infarction (MI) have shown a 28-day survival disadvantage compared with men. However, results were less consistent when considering long-term mortality in 28-day survivors. The aim was to estimate the trends for sex-related differences in the three endpoints considered for this study: (1) 28-day mortality or severe ventricular dysfunction (acute pulmonary oedema or cardiogenic shock) during the hospital stay, (2) 28-day mortality and (3) two-year cardiovascular mortality or non-fatal MI in 28-day survivors after a first MI. A cohort of 3,982 consecutive patients with first Q-wave MI admitted to a university tertiary reference hospital between 1978 and 2007 was followed for 2 years. Short-term prognosis improved in women over the studied period; similar rates were observed in both sexes in the 2000s. After adjusting for age, co-morbidities and anterior location of MI, female sex had an odds ratio=1.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-2.17) of short-term severe MI or death over the studied period. Overall, sex differences in long-term prognosis remained similar over the studied period (hazard ratio=1.40; 95% CI 1.02-1.91). In conclusion, short-term prognosis improved over the past 30 years for first Q-wave MI patients, becoming similar for both men and women in the most recent decade. Long-term prognosis did not improve in either men or women, indicating that secondary prevention should be reinforced to achieve consistent reductions in the number of cardiovascular events."mycardial	MANAG	"The aim of this study was to determine the impact of in-hospital revascularization on different genders and to compare the gender difference in short- and long-term prognosis of Chinese patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).The benefit of invasive strategy between the genders of Asian ethnic populations with NSTEMI remains unclear.A total of 343 consecutive NSTEMI patients were enrolled, 104 (30%) of them were women. All patients were followed up for at least 3 years or until the occurrence of a major event. The primary end point was all-cause death. The secondary end point was the combined occurrence of death or myocardial (re-)infarction (MI).The adjusted in-hospital and long-term clinical outcomes were similar between men and women. However, in-hospital revascularization significantly reduced long-term mortality and composite endpoint in men (P < 0.001), but not in women. After risk stratification by GRACE score, there was favorable effect of invasive strategy in high-risk women. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, GRACE score (hazard ratio; HR, 1.017; P < 0.001) and in-hospital revascularization (HR, 0.516; P = 0.008) were the independent predictors of death or MI in men. However, only GRACE score was the independent predictor of composite endpoint in women (HR, 1.012; P = 0.004).In Asian ethnic patients with NSTEMI, the in-hospital and long-term prognosis were similar between men and women. In-hospital revascularization has a benefit in men and high-risk women for reducing the all-cause death at 1 and 3 years. Our data provide evidence supporting the guideline recommendation for an invasive strategy in high-risk women."mycardial	CLIN	"In the present study, we evaluated the performance and clinical utility of a high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT) assay. The within- and between-assay variations (coefficients of variation: CV) in the low and high concentrations of troponin T in serum samples were 0.84% to 3.34%, respectively. Analysis of interferents showed that only hemoglobin negatively influenced the assay results. Blank assay was < 0.001 ng/mL, and a limit of quantification (10% CV) was found at 0.005 ng/mL. The correlation coefficient (r) between hs-cTnT and the conventional assay was 0.997 (p < 0.000). The high-sensitivity assay system could detect cTnT in 88% of samples in which the conventional assay could not detect any immunoreactivity. The 99th percentile in healthy subjects, determined using 559 samples from medical checkups, was 0.011 ng/mL. There was a gender difference (hs-cTnT levels were higher in men than in women), and hs-cTnT levels increased with age. Because hs-cTnT level exceeded 0.011 ng/mL approximately 2 hours after the onset of chest pain in patients with acute myocardial infarction, hs-cTnT can serve as a biomarker for early detection of myocardial infarction. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.491, p < 0.001) between hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP, and hs-cTnT levels increased with the progression of the disease state, as assessed using New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. These findings indicate that the hs-cTnT assay is sensitive enough to diagnose early-stage acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure."mycardial	CLIN	"To determine gender based differences in presenting symptoms in patients with acute coronary syndrome.Cross-sectional, comparative study.National institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD), Karachi, from January to June 2010.Information was obtained by questionnaire from the patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Fisher's exact test and Chi-square analysis were used for data testing. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Four hundred and thirty-seven patients included 230 males and 207 females. Among them unstable angina was diagnosed in 112 males and 142 females, Non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was diagnosed in 37 males and 26 females. ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was diagnosed in 81 males and 39 females. Retrosternal pain was the presenting feature in 95 males and 100 females, left sided chest pain was noted in 155 males and 127 females, left arm pain was noted in 61 males and 59 females, right chest pain was noted in 74 males and 41 females, lower jaw pain was noted in 11 males and 16 females, abdominal pain was noted in 9 males and 17 females, 76 males and 88 females had dyspnea, 26 males and 38 females had vomiting, 24 males and 26 females had vertigo, 39 males and 28 females complained of sweating, 3 males and 6 females complained of palpitation, 2 males and 1 female complained of loss of consciousness.There are gender differences in the symptoms of ACS. These differences may have a bearing on clinical practice, interpretation of available clinical studies and the design of future investigations."mycardial	MANAG	"Many studies have looked at differences between men and women with acute coronary syndrome. These studies demonstrate that women have worse outcomes, receive fewer invasive interventions, and experience delay in the initiation of established medical therapies.Using innovative technology, we set out to unveil and resolve any gender disparities in the evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with a positive troponin while in the emergency department. Our goal was to assess the feasibility of using a business management query system to create an automated data report that could identify deficiencies in standards of care and be used to improve the quality of treatment we provide our patients.Over a 12-month period, key markers for patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) were tracked (e.g., time to electrocardiogram, door to medications). During this time, educational endeavors were initiated utilizing McKesson's Horizon Business Insightâ„¢ (McKesson Information Solutions, Alpharetta, GA) to illustrate gender differences in standard therapy. Subsequently, indicators were evaluated for improvement.Substantial improvements in key indicators for management of NSTEMI were obtained and gender differences minimized where education was provided.The integration of these information systems allowed us to create a successful performance improvement tool and, as an added benefit, nearly eliminated the need for manual retrospective chart reviews."mycardial	CLIN	"The value of urinary albumin excretion in the prediction of myocardial ischemia in men and women with type 2 diabetes is not well understood. We questioned whether gender influences the albuminuria-ischemic heart disease relationship in patients with type 2 diabetes.We designed a matched case-control study of 926 patients with albuminuria (cases) and 926 age and body mass index matched patients without albuminuria (controls). Ischemic heart disease was defined as the presence of (1) history of angina pectoris or angina equivalent symptoms and critical care unit admission, (2) myocardial infarction and/or electrocardiographic evidence of Q-wave myocardial infarction, (3) coronary revascularization and/or stenting, (4) positive myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography scan, (5) ischemic ST-segment or T-wave changes, and (6) positive stress testing.Patients with albuminuria had a lower glomerular filtration rate and a longer diabetes duration than patients without albuminuria. In the group of cases, there were a greater number of men with ischemic heart disease (120 of 370; 32.4%) compared to women (97 of 559; 17.4%) (P<0.001). The odds ratio of having ischemic heart disease according to the presence or absence of albuminuria was 1.25 [95% CI: 1.01-1.56] (P<0.05) in all studied populations, 0.79 [95% CI: 0.51-1.21] (P=0.14) in women, and 2.84 [95% CI: 1.68-4.79] (P<0.001) in men. We showed that diabetes duration, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and hemoglobin A(1c) influence albuminuria in women, while diabetes duration, fasting blood sugar, and diastolic blood pressure influence albuminuria in men.Men with albuminuria are at increased risk of ischemic heart disease compared to women. This may be related to the role of high-density lipoprotein on the albuminuria-gender relationship."mycardial	MANAG	"There has been controversy over the disparity between men and women with regard to the management and prognosis of acute myocardial infarction. Analyzing nationwide multicenter prospective registries in Korea, the aim of this study was to determine whether female gender independently imposes a risk for mortality. Data from 14,253 patients who were hospitalized for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction from November 2005 to September 2010 were extracted from registries. Compared to men, women were older (mean age 56 Â± 12 vs 67 Â± 10 years, p < 0.001), and female gender was associated with a higher frequency of co-morbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Women had longer pain-to-door time and more severe hemodynamic status than men. All-cause mortality rates were 13.6% in women and 7.0% in men at 1 year after the index admission (hazard ratio for women 2.01, 95% confidence interval 1.80 to 2.25, p < 0.001). The risk for death after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction corresponded highly with age. Although the risk remained high after adjusting for age, further analyses adjusting for medical history, clinical performance, and hemodynamic status diminished the gender effect (hazard ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.17, p = 0.821). Propensity score matching, as a sensitivity analysis, corroborated the results. In conclusion, this study shows that women have a comparable risk for death after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction as men. The gender effect was accounted for mostly by the women's older age, complex co-morbidities, and severe hemodynamic conditions at presentation."mycardial	OUTC	"Long-term follow-up (up to 9 years) from the OAT allows for the examination of sex differences in outcomes and the effect of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a relatively homogeneous cohort of myocardial infarction (MI) survivors.The OAT randomized 484 (22%) women and 1717 men to PCI of the occluded infarct-related artery vs medical therapy alone >24 hours post-MI. There was no benefit of PCI on the composite of death, MI, and class IV heart failure. We analyzed outcomes by sex and investigated for sex-based trial selection bias using a concurrent registry.Women were older and more likely to have left anterior descending infarct-related artery, diabetes and hypertension, history of heart failure, and rales at randomization but were less likely to smoke. The proportion and characteristics of women enrolled in the trial and the registry were similar, including left ventricular ejection fraction and extent of disease. Women had higher rates of the primary composite (hazard ratio [HR] 1.48, P = .0002), death (HR 1.50, P = .001), and heart failure (HR 2.53, P < .0001) but not reinfarction (HR 1.12, P = .57). Female sex was not independently associated with the primary end point or death on multivariate analysis. There was a trend toward independent association of female sex with heart failure (HR 1.66, P = .02).Women in OAT had a higher primary end point event rate than did men, mainly driven by heart failure. Female sex was not independently associated with death or MI in this well-defined cohort with comparable extent of coronary artery disease, similar medical therapy, and equivalent left ventricular ejection fraction by sex."mycardial	REVIEW	"More women die every year from cardiovascular disease than men from any other cause. Several fundamental variations have been reported in the mechanisms underlying coronary artery disease, which suggest that its genetic basis varies by gender. Such differences are not limited to gonadal hormones and can be seen in the physiology of atherosclerosis, including plaque components, endothelial function and hemostasis. It is possible to speculate that genetic factors are different in men and women and probably involve biological pathways that have not yet been identified. To date, studies performed by means of the candidate gene approach have identified several genetic variants associated with coronary artery disease in women. However, these scientific data have not been translated into clinical practice. It has recently become possible to search for common gene variants that affect the susceptibility to myocardial infarction on the basis of our knowledge of common single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes across the human genome using genome-wide genotyping technologies. Currently more than 20 gene regions have been associated with ischemic heart disease using this approach. However, so far we do not know several genetic variants differently associated with risk of ischemic heart disease in men and women. A challenge for the near future will therefore be to identify genetic variants that maximally differentiate males from females, and also to identify possible relationships between genes and environment and genes and hormones in both sexes."mycardial	CLIN	"Glomerular filtration rate<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Cystatin C is believed to be a better tool than creatinine for detection of mild renal dysfunction (>60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and possibly a more sensitive marker for cardiovascular risk and all-cause mortality. We examined the association of cystatin C with cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality in a prospective population-based study.Cystatin C was measured in 2852 men and 3153 women in the TromsÃ¸ Study 1994/95. Gender-specific associations during 12 years of follow-up for all-cause mortality and 9.5 years for myocardial infarction (MI) and ischaemic stroke were assessed (Cox proportional hazard ratios, HRs).During follow-up, 591 MIs, 293 ischaemic strokes and 1262 deaths occurred. In women, HR for all-cause mortality was increased in the upper cystatin C quartile (â‰¥0.93 mg/L) compared with the lowest quartile (â‰¤0.73 mg/L); 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.84. A significant interaction with gender was observed. One SD (0.17 mg/L) increase in cystatin C was associated with 9% higher risk of death in women, also when persons with a cancer history were excluded. Crude HRs for MI and ischaemic stroke were increased in both genders, but the associations did not persist after multivariable adjustments. No independent associations with end points were observed in non-gender-specific analyses.Cystatin C was not independently associated with fatal and non-fatal MI or ischaemic stroke in the general population. However, cystatin C was a risk factor for all-cause mortality in women."mycardial	CLIN	"To describe symptoms of a first myocardial infarction in men and women with and without diabetes.We conducted a population-based study of 4028 people aged 25-74 years, with first myocardial infarction registered in the Northern Sweden Multinational MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease (MONICA) myocardial infarction registry between 2000 and 2006. Symptoms were classified as typical or atypical according to the World Health Organization MONICA manual.Among patients with diabetes, 90.1% reported typical symptoms of myocardial infarction; the corresponding proportion among patients without diabetes was 91.5%. In the diabetes group, 88.8% of women and 90.8% of men had typical symptoms of myocardial infarction. No differences were found in symptoms of myocardial infarction between women with and without diabetes or between men with and without diabetes. Atypical symptoms were more prevalent in the older age groups (> 65 years) than in the younger age groups (< 65 years). The increases were approximately equal among men and women, with and without diabetes. Diabetes was not an independent predictor for having atypical symptoms of myocardial infarction.Typical symptoms of myocardial infarction were equally prevalent in patients with and without diabetes and there were no sex differences in symptoms among persons with diabetes. Diabetes was not a predictor of atypical symptoms."mycardial	CLIN	"We investigate age and sex differences in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) after cardiac surgery in a prospective study of 2038 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. An age of â‰¥ 70 years implied changes in the type of AMI from the ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI). Men were more likely than women to suffer from AMI after cardiac surgery (11.8% vs. 5.6%), as a result of the higher frequency of STEMI (6% of men vs. 1.8% of women; P < 0.001) in both age groups. A troponin-I (Tn-I) peak was significantly higher in patients â‰¥ 70 years old. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients â‰¥ 70 (7.3%) than in those < 70 years old (3.3%), because of the increased mortality observed in men with non-AMI (2.1% vs. 6.3%) and women with STEMI (0% vs. 28.6%) and non-STEMI (0% vs. 36.8%, P < 0.05). Old age was associated with a higher frequency of non-STEMI, Tn-I peak, mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Regardless of age, men more often suffer from AMI (particularly STEMI). AMI in women had a notable impact on excess mortality and ICU stay observed in patients â‰¥ 70 years of age. Clinical and Tn-I peak differences are expected in relation to age and gender after AMI post-cardiac surgery."mycardial	Management	"There is conflicting evidence regarding sex-based differences in myocardial salvage and clinical outcome in patients after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are sex-associated differences in infarct characteristics (myocardial salvage, infarct size, microvascular obstruction) and clinical outcome in STEMI patients who are reperfused by primary angioplasty.In this study, we included 96 women and 239 men with STEMI undergoing primary angioplasty <12 hours after symptom onset. T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI was used to assess myocardial salvage, infarct size, and microvascular obstruction. The primary clinical end point was mortality within 6 months after the index event. The amount of myocardium at risk and final infarct size did not differ significantly between women and men. Consequently, myocardial salvage was similar between groups (P=0.36). Women had a higher in-hospital (3% versus 10%; P=0.03) and 30-day (5% versus 11%; P=0.05) mortality rate than did men. Six months after infarction, no significant sex differences in survival were obvious (11% versus 7%; P=0.21). After adjustment for baseline differences (age, diabetes, hypertension), female sex was not an independent predictor of mortality and major adverse cardiac events.The efficacy of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (myocardial salvage) in patients with STEMI is not sex dependent. Although women STEMI patients had worse unadjusted in-hospital and 30-day clinical outcomes than did men, multivariate analysis revealed that the observed sex-based differences in early death after STEMI were likely related to differences in baseline risk and clinical characteristics."mycardial	OUTC	"The gender-based differences in adverse events after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation between Chinese women and men have not been fully studied. The present study aimed to compare the 5-year clinical outcome after DES implantation in Chinese women and men.Chinese women (n = 298) and men (n = 698) with newly diagnosed de novo coronary lesions were studied after DES implantation. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) over a 5-year follow-up, including myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death, and target vessel revascularization (TVR). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare the adjusted MACE rates between sexes.Women differed in body habitus and had increased fasting cholesterol. Fewer women presented with MI, and they had better cardiac function with less complex disease. The unadjusted rate of MI at 3 years (2.1%) and 5 years (5.0%) and MACE (25.2%) at 5 years in men was significantly higher than that of women (0.3%, 1.0% and 17.8%, P = 0.050, P = 0.032, and P = 0.011, respectively). After PSM, the adjusted adverse events between sexes were similar. The stent thrombosis rate rapidly increased after 2 years in men.There were significant gender-based differences in baseline characteristics. Chinese men had equivalent outcomes to women after DES after adjustment by PSM. The increased rate of MI in men was attributed to an increased unadjusted rate of MACE."mycardial	OUTC	"To investigate and analyze the impact of gender difference on outcome and prognosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).This was a prospective and multicentered observation study. All the patients with acute STEMI admitted to the hospitals from June 1(st) 2009 to June 1(st) 2010 were continuously recruited. In this study, a unified questionnaire was applied and the 382 patients satisfied the criteria. A unified follow-up questionnaire was used on patients who were discharged from the hospital.On average, the female patients were 8 years older than the males. The median ""symptom-to-balloon time"" was 312.5 minutes in females and 270.0 minutes in males, and it was significantly different (P = 0.007). During hospitalization, a higher proportion of female patients developed heart failure, angina and bleeding. No gender differences were found on the in-hospital mortality rates and medical therapy recommended by the guideline. The female patients were more prone to multi-vessel disease than males (P = 0.002). Success rates of primary PCI did not show any gender differences. One-month mortality and other cardiovascular events also did not show gender difference when the patients were followed for one month after being discharged. The rates of heart failure and re-hospitalization due to cardiac incidents among female patients were obviously higher than the males, three months after being discharged (P = 0.007, respectively). However, the three-month and long-term cardiac mortality did not show differences related to gender. Female patients were associated with higher all-cause mortality than that in males, but there was no statistically significant difference (female 4.2% vs. male 1.6%; P = 0.056). Data from multi-factor regression analysis showed that being female was not an independent predictor related to in-hospital mortality or during the follow-up period.Being female was not an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality or during follow-up period among patients who were treated with primary PCI. Worse long-term outcome seen in female patients was likely to be explained by older age or longer pre-hospital delayed time."mycardial	Management	"To describe gender-specific long-term outcome and initiation of secondary preventive medication among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Observational cohort study.Nationwide registries.We included 18,279 patients: 6364 women (35%) and 11,915 men (65%), admitted with AMI (median age, 67 years; range, 30-90 years) surviving for at least 2 months.According to sex, patients were stratified by invasive treatment strategy: (1) revascularized; (2) examined with coronary angiography (CAG) but not revascularized; and (3) not examined with CAG.All-cause mortality and readmission with AMI. Initiation of secondary preventive medication.Of 18,279 patients with a first AMI who survived 2 months, 1857 women (29%) and 1756 men (15%) were not examined with CAG (P<.001), 1295 women (20%) and 1563 men (13%) were examined but not revascularized (P<.001), and 3212 women (51%) and 8596 men (72%) were revascularized (P<.001). Not being examined with CAG after AMI was associated with a three-fold increase in risk of death and, importantly, a 50% increase in the risk of a recurrent AMI compared with patients who were revascularized. Among patients who were revascularized, 85-92% initiated recommended secondary preventive medication compared to 46-71% in patients not examined with CAG (P<.001). Initiation of secondary preventive medication was higher in men (81-84%) than in women (73-79%; P<.001), which could be ascribed to the differences in invasive strategy.In both sexes, those who were not examined had a highly increased risk of both recurrent AMI and death. Moreover, initiation of secondary preventive medication was closely related to the choice of invasive strategy disfavoring the women."mycardial	Outcomes	"We assessed the relation between female sex and sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) use on long-term outcomes in acute myocardial infarction.There are no data on sex-specific differences in long-term benefit of SES use compared with bare-metal stent (BMS) use among patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary interventions.We performed a post hoc analysis of the MULTISTRATEGY trial. Hazard ratios (HRs) of events with 95% CI for sex and stent type were computed using Cox proportional regression with adjustment for confounders.A total of 744 patients, 64 years old (55-73 years old), 179 (24.1%) women, were enrolled. After a follow-up of 1,080 days, SES use was associated with a significant reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events, that is, the composite of all-cause death, reinfarction, or clinically driven target vessel revascularization (TVR) (13.9% vs 23.6%, adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.94, P = .026) and of TVR (6.1% vs 15.1%, adjusted HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19-0.63, P < .001) in men. Conversely, SES use was not associated to a better outcome among women (major adverse cardiovascular events 21.9% in SES vs 18.2% in the BMS group, adjusted HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.53-3.02, P = .59; TVR 6.6% vs 9.1%, adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.17-2.21, P = .46).In this analysis, the clinical benefit of SES use, over BMS, at 3-year follow-up was restricted to men and was not observed among women."mycardial	CLIN	"Women are generally older than men at hospitalization for myocardial infarction (MI) and also present less frequently with chest pain/discomfort. However, few studies have taken age into account when examining sex differences in clinical presentation and mortality.To examine the relationship between sex and symptom presentation and between sex, symptom presentation, and hospital mortality, before and after accounting for age in patients hospitalized with MI.Observational study from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction, 1994-2006, of 1,143,513 registry patients (481,581 women and 661,932 men).We examined predictors of MI presentation without chest pain and the relationship between age, sex, and hospital mortality.The proportion of MI patients who presented without chest pain was significantly higher for women than men (42.0% [95% CI, 41.8%-42.1%] vs 30.7% [95% CI, 30.6%-30.8%]; P < .001). There was a significant interaction between age and sex with chest pain at presentation, with a larger sex difference in younger than older patients, which became attenuated with advancing age. Multivariable adjusted age-specific odds ratios (ORs) for lack of chest pain for women (referent, men) were younger than 45 years, 1.30 (95% CI, 1.23-1.36); 45 to 54 years, 1.26 (95% CI, 1.22-1.30); 55 to 64 years, 1.24 (95% CI, 1.21-1.27); 65 to 74 years, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.11-1.15); and 75 years or older, 1.03 (95% CI, 1.02-1.04). Two-way interaction (sex and age) on MI presentation without chest pain was significant (P < .001). The in-hospital mortality rate was 14.6% for women and 10.3% for men. Younger women presenting without chest pain had greater hospital mortality than younger men without chest pain, and these sex differences decreased or even reversed with advancing age, with adjusted OR for age younger than 45 years, 1.18 (95% CI, 1.00-1.39); 45 to 54 years, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.02-1.26); 55 to 64 years, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96-1.09); 65 to 74 years, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95); and 75 years or older, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79-0.83). The 3-way interaction (sex, age, and chest pain) on mortality was significant (P < .001).In this registry of patients hospitalized with MI, women were more likely than men to present without chest pain and had higher mortality than men within the same age group, but sex differences in clinical presentation without chest pain and in mortality were attenuated with increasing age."mycardial	Outcomes	"Gender-related differences in the incidence of bleeding and its relation to subsequent mortality in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with fibrinolysis are not well understood. We studied patients with STEMI receiving fibrinolysis enrolled in 6 clinical trials. Outcomes included moderate or severe bleeding defined using Global Utilization of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries (GUSTO) criteria and adjusted 1-year mortality (excluding deaths in first 24 hours). Moderate or severe bleeding was 1.9-fold higher in women compared to men (13.3% vs 7.1%, p <0.0001). Bleeding remained higher in women even after adjustment for baseline differences (odd ratios 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42 to 1.62). In fact, female gender was second most important prognostic factor (Wald chi-square 153.6) after older age (Wald chi-square 241.2) in the multivariable bleeding model. Overall 1-year mortality was similar in women and men after adjusting for prognostically important baseline differences (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.17). However, after adjustment for baseline confounders and bleeding, female gender was associated with a lower risk of 1-year death. Thus, adjusted 1-year mortality was similar in women compared to men without bleeding (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.19) but lower in women compared to men with bleeding (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98, p for interaction of gender by bleeding = 0.0016). The highest adjusted 1-year mortality was observed in men with bleeding (HR 2.42, 95% CI 2.20 to 2.66) followed by women with bleeding (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.33) and women without bleeding (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.19, referent men without bleeding). In conclusion, in patients with fibrinolytic-treated STEMI, women had a higher incidence but lower mortality with bleeding than men. These data highlight the importance of understanding factors associated with gender-related differences in bleeding and represent an opportunity for improving outcomes of women and men with fibrinolytic-treated STEMI."mycardial	MANAG	"To compare the differences on therapeutic approach and short-term outcomes between male and female patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).Data of Chinese STEMI patients were retrospectively analyzed from a global multicenter clinical trial of reviparin and metabolic modulation in acute myocardial infarction treatment evaluation (CREATE). The patients were divided into two groups according to gender and difference on demographic, baseline clinical characteristics at admission, reperfusion and drug therapy and 30-day all-cause mortality, re-infarction, stroke, hemorrhage, heart failure and combined end points were compared.Of the 7431 patients, 29.1% were female. Female patients were older than male patients [(68.2 Â± 9.1) years vs. (60.3 Â± 12.1) years]. On admission, heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and Killip class were higher and the delay between onset of chest pain and arrival at hospital was longer in female patients than in male patients (all P < 0.01). Male patients often presented MI in anterior leads while female patients often presented MI in inferior and lateral leads. History of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and heart failure was significantly higher in female than in male patients (all P < 0.01). Incidence of high blood glucose was higher in female while high blood potassium was higher in male patients (P < 0.01). Rate of reperfusion therapy was lower and the use aspirin and diuretic was more frequent in female patients than in male patients, while frequency of clopidogrel, Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor, Î²-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lipid-lowering drug use was significantly higher in male than in female patients (all P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender was a predictor for less PCI therapy (P < 0.01). Thirty-day all cause mortality (OR = 1.425, 95%CI: 1.163 - 1.747, P < 0.01) and combined end points (OR = 1.193, 95%CI: 1.010 - 1.410, P = 0.04) were significantly higher in female patients than in male patients.There are gender-related differences on therapeutic approach and short-term outcome in Chinese STEMI patients. The unfavorable demographic and baseline clinical profile could partially explain the less reperfusion therapy rate and worse prognosis in female patients."mycardial	CLIN	"Q waves have been shown to be a stronger prognostic marker than time from symptom onset to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. We examined whether the relative importance of these 2 measurements is modulated by patient gender. Q waves in the area of ST-segment elevation on baseline electrocardiogram were evaluated at a central core laboratory in 4,530 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (3,468 men and 1,062 women) without previous infarction and who underwent PCI in the Assessment of Pexelizumab in Acute Myocardial Infarction (APEX-AMI) trial. Women were older and had higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, Killip class >I, and lower creatinine clearance compared to men. Time from symptom onset to PCI >3 hours was associated with a trend toward worse 90-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 2.2) in men but not in women (0.8, 0.5 to 1.4). In contrast, presence of Q waves on baseline electrocardiogram was associated with significantly higher 90-day mortality in men (adjusted hazard ratio 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 2.7) and women (2.3, 1.2 to 4.2). In conclusion, in this gender-specific analysis, baseline Q wave was found be a better marker of risk of 90-day mortality than time from symptom onset to PCI, overall, and especially in women."mycardial	EPI	"Analyze cognitive and emotional variables between genders in terms of the decision time (DT) to seek care when experiencing symptoms of myocardial infarction. One hundred adults were interviewed at two hospitals in Salvador-BA. The analysis used percentage means, the chi-square test, and a robust linear regression model. Most participants were male, with a mean age of 58.78 years and a low socioeconomic status. The geometrical mean of the sample was 1.1h (0.9h for men, and 1.4h for women). A shorter decision time was found for those who considered their symptoms to be severe, and a longer decision time for those who expected symptoms to improve and took something to feel better, with statistically significant associations. An interaction was observed between gender and the following variables: waiting for symptoms to improve (p=0.014), concealing symptoms (p=0.016) and asking for help (p=0.050), thus an association was observed between the variables of interest and DT. The decision times were long and were affected by cognitive, emotional and gender variables. Nursing care may promote early assistance."mycardial	CLIN	"The published literature suggests differences in presenting symptoms for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), management, and outcomes according to gender and age. However, limited information exists on this topic among Hispanics.In Puerto Rican patients hospitalized with an initial AMI, we examined differences in presenting symptoms, effective cardiac therapies, and in-hospital mortality as a function of gender and age groups. We reviewed the medical records of patients hospitalized with a validated AMI in 12 greater San Juan, Puerto Rico hospitals during 2007.The average age of 1,415 patients hospitalized with a first AMI was 66 years and 45 % were women. Chest pain (81%) was the most prevalent acute presenting symptom with significant differences in its frequency between women (77%) and men (85%)(p<0.001). Right arm pain, shortness-of-breath/dyspnea, and sweating/ diaphoresis were most prevalent in patients 55-64 years old (45%), compared with patients 75 years and older (29%)(p<0.005). Relative to men and patients < 55 years old, coronary angiography/thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary interventions were used less frequently in women and older patients (>75 years old). During hospitalization for AMI the in-hospital death rate was higher in women (8.6%) than men (6.0%), and increased with advancing age (p<0.05).These findings suggest significant gender and age differences in presenting symptoms, management, and early mortality in Puerto Ricans hospitalized with an initial AMI. It remains of considerable importance that health care personnel become aware of these gender and age differences to improve the management and outcomes of these patients."mycardial	MANAG	"Recent studies have described a gender bias against women in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).We sought to measure the impact that a prehospital electrocardiogram (PH ECG) has on prehospital total scene time to hospital arrival time, comparing men and women with the complaint of chest pain (cCP).This study retrospectively analyzed San Diego Emergency Medical Services (EMS) runsheets of patients with cCP before and after implementation of the PH ECG protocol. The average scene time (ST), transport time (TT), and total scene-to-arrival-at-hospital time (STH) were compared. After stratification by gender, times were compared in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to those without STEMI.Of 21,742 EMS activations for patients with cCP, there were no significant differences overall. When stratified by gender, there was a significant reduction of ST (00:19:16 min vs. 00:20:48 min, p<0.001, 95% CI 00:01:17-00:01:48) and STH (00:33:22 min vs. 00:35:44 min, p<0.001, 95% CI 00:01:21-00:02:24) favoring men in cases without STEMI. In cases of STEMI, men had a significant reduction in ST (00:17:27 min vs. 00:20:29 min, p<0.001, 95% CI 00:01:24-00:04:40) and STH (00:30:30 min vs. 00:34:25 min, p<0.01, 95% CI 00:01:23-00:06:26) times compared to women.Prehospital ECG implementation led to no significant differences in pre- and post-implementation times. In cases of STEMI, men had significantly reduced scene time and scene-to-hospital time when compared to women. The precise reason for these disparities remains unknown."mycardial	MANAG	"To investigate possible gender differences in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and without significant stenoses on coronary angiography (CAG) regarding prognosis and use of secondary preventive medication.Nationwide register-based cohort study.By compiling data from Danish registries, we identified 20,800 patients hospitalized with AMI during 2005-2007. We included the 834 women and 761 men without significant stenoses on CAG who were discharged and alive after 60 days.All-cause mortality, recurrent AMI, and redeeming a prescription for a lipid-lowering drug, beta-blocker, clopidogrel, or aspirin within 60 days of discharge.During follow-up, 97 women and 60 men died, resulting in a crude female/male hazard ratio (HR) of 1.51 (95% CI 1.09-2.08). After adjustment for age, time-period, and comorbidity, the gender difference was attenuated (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.86-1.72). AMI recurrence was experienced by 28 women and 29 men with a female/male HR 0.88 (95% CI 0.52-1.48). After multivariable adjustment results were similar (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.50-1.43). More women than men redeemed a prescription for lipid-lowering drugs with no differences in other medication. In the adjusted models lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, clopidogrel, and aspirin were all redeemed equally with odds ratio (OR) 1.25 (95% CI 0.99-1.59), OR 1.10 (95% CI 0.88-1.37), OR 1.09 (95% CI 0.88-1.34), and OR 1.13 (95% CI 0.90-1.42), respectively.Our study shows that in a population of patients with a first admission for AMI and no significant stenoses on CAG, women share the same prospects as men regarding long-term prognosis and the extent of secondary preventive medical treatment."mycardial	MANAG	"The gender perspectives of the triage of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in a community are insufficiently explored.Patients (n=3224) with symptoms of ACS, in whom ECG was sent by the ambulance crew to a coronary care unit (CCU)/ cath lab, were investigated in the municipality of GÃ¶teborg in 2004-2007. Background, triage priority, investigations and treatment were analysed (p-values age adjusted) in relation to gender. Data were compared with three published studies (1995-2002: Surveys 1-3).Women were directly admitted to the CCU significantly less frequently than men (23 versus 35%, p<0.0001). Adjusted for ECG findings, age, symptoms and medical history, odds ratio and 95% confidence limits (for direct admission; men versus women) were 0.61; 0.46-0.82. SURVEY 1: Patients with ACS, aged <80, in CCU at a university hospital (n=1744). Only minor differences between women and men, with regard to investigations and treatment, were found. SURVEY 2: Patients discharged from hospital (dead or alive) with AMI, regardless of type of ward (n=1423). Fewer women than men were admitted to CCU and fewer women underwent coronary angiography (21% versus 40%; p=0.02) and coronary revascularisation (12% versus 27%; p=0.004). SURVEY 3: Patients with symptoms of AMI (n=930) and patients with a confirmed AMI (n=130) from a pre-hospital perspective. Women tended to be given lower priority than men both by the ambulance dispatchers and by the ambulance crew.In our practice setting, men are given priority over women in admission to CCU, but no gender differences are seen thereafter."mycardial	EPI	"Knowledge of trends in the incidence of and survival after myocardial infarction (MI) in a community setting is important to understanding trends in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rates.We estimated race- and gender-specific trends in the incidence of hospitalized MI, case fatality, and CHD mortality from community-wide surveillance and validation of hospital discharges and of in- and out-of-hospital deaths among 35- to 74-year-old residents of 4 communities in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. Biomarker adjustment accounted for change from reliance on cardiac enzymes to widespread use of troponin measurements over time. During 1987-2008, a total of 30 985 fatal or nonfatal hospitalized acute MI events occurred. Rates of CHD death among persons without a history of MI fell an average 4.7%/y among men and 4.3%/y among women. Rates of both in- and out-of-hospital CHD death declined significantly throughout the period. Age- and biomarker-adjusted average annual rate of incident MI decreased 4.3% among white men, 3.8% among white women, 3.4% among black women, and 1.5% among black men. Declines in CHD mortality and MI incidence were greater in the second decade (1997-2008). Failure to account for biomarker shift would have masked declines in incidence, particularly among blacks. Age-adjusted 28-day case fatality after hospitalized MI declined 3.5%/y among white men, 3.6%/y among black men, 3.0%/y among white women, and 2.6%/y among black women.Although these findings from 4 communities may not be directly generalizable to blacks and whites in the entire United States, we observed significant declines in MI incidence, primarily as a result of downward trends in rates between 1997 and 2008."mycardial	OUTC	"Younger women hospitalized with an acute myocardial infarction (MI) have a poorer prognosis than men. Whether this is true for patients with acute ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI) is not extensively studied. Using the MarketScan 2004 to 2007 Commercial and Medicare supplemental admission databases, we assessed gender differences in in-hospital mortality according to age in 91,088 patients (35,899 with STEMI, 55,189 with NSTEMI) who were 18 to 89 years old and had acute MI as their primary diagnosis. Patients with STEMI had significantly higher in-hospital mortality than those with NSTEMI (4.35% vs 3.53%, p <0.0001). Compared to men women were older, had higher co-morbidity scores, and were less likely to undergo revascularization during hospitalization in the STEMI and NSTEMI populations. In patients with STEMI the unadjusted women-to-men odds ratio for in-hospital mortality was 2.29 (95% confidence interval 1.48 to 3.55) for the 18- to 49-year age group, 1.68 (1.28 to 2.21) for 50 to 59, 1.48 (1.17 to 1.88) for 60 to 69, 1.28 (1.06 to 1.57) for 70 to 79, and 1.01 (0.83 to 1.23) for 80 to 89. Corresponding unadjusted odds ratios were 1.51 (0.87 to 2.61), 1.46 (1.11 to 1.92), 1.29 (1.04 to 1.61), 0.83 (0.70 to 0.99) and 0.82 (0.70 to 0.94) for patients with NSTEMI. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, excess risk for in-hospital mortality in younger women versus their men counterparts (<60 years old) persisted in STEMI. In patients with NSTEMI the difference between younger women and younger men was not statistically significant; however, older women (â‰¥70 years old) had better survival than men. In conclusion, higher risk of in-hospital mortality in younger women compared to younger men is more evident in patients with STEMI."mycardial	MANAG	"Still contrasting are data on the impact of sex on outcome in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).We sought sex-related differences in management and early outcomes in 1127 STEMI patients submitted to PCI consecutively admitted to our intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) in Florence from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2009.Females were significantly older, leaner (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, respectively), more hypertensive (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and diabetic (pâ€‰=â€‰0.016); they showed a higher incidence of neurological impairment (pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (pâ€‰=â€‰0.048). Higher Killip classes were more frequent in females (pâ€‰=â€‰0.015). Door-to-balloon time was higher in females (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) who showed a higher incidence of major bleeding (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and a higher in-ICCU mortality rate (pâ€‰=â€‰0.037). The use of IIbIIIa glycoprotein inhibitors was lower in females (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) who exhibited higher values of admission glycaemia and peak glycaemia (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 and pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, respectively), higher values of fibrinogen (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and lower eGFR and haemoglobin values (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).According to our data, STEMI women show not only a different risk profile (older age, comorbidities, lower haemoglobin values), but also a different gender-related metabolic and inflammatory responses to acute myocardial ischaemia in respect to men. All these factors can account for the higher in-ICCU mortality in women and strongly suggest that STEMI women deserve more intensive care due to a more severe haemodynamic derangement (as indicated by the higher use of inotropes, diuretics, and non-invasive ventilation) and to a more serious metabolic impairment (as inferred by higher glucose values)."mycardial	EPI	"It remains to be examined whether urbanization and lifestyle changes are associated with the incidence and mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Japan.A total of 19,921 AMI patients (male/female 14,290/5,631) registered by the MIYAGI-AMI Registry Study from 1988 to 2009 were divided into 2 groups according to their residences; inside (urban area, n=7,316) and outside (rural area, n=11,402) of Sendai City. From 1988 to 2009, the incidence of AMI (/100,000 persons/year) increased more rapidly in the rural area (24.2 to 51.4) than in the urban area (31.3 to 40.8) (P<0.001), with rapid aging in both areas. Moreover, from 1998 to 2009, the age-adjusted incidence of AMI in young (<44 years) and middle-aged (45-64 years) male patients (both P<0.05) in the rural area increased significantly, along with a markedly increased prevalence of dyslipidemia (P<0.001). Although in-hospital mortality from AMI decreased in both areas over the last 20 years (both P<0.001), it remained relatively higher in female than in male patients and was associated with higher age of the onset, longer elapsing time for admission and lower prevalence of primary coronary intervention in female patients in both areas.These results demonstrate that urbanization and lifestyle changes have been associated with the incidence and mortality from AMI, although sex differences still remain to be improved."mycardial	EPI	"It is not clear whether gender is associated with different hospitalization cost and lengths for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We identified patients hospitalized for primary diagnosis of AMI with (STEMI) or without (NSTEMI) ST elevation from 1999 to 2008 through a national database containing 1,000,000 subjects. As compared to that in 1999~2000, total (0.35â€°â€‰â€‰versus 0.06â€°, P < 0.001) and male (0.59â€°â€‰â€‰versus 0.07â€°, P < 0.001) STEMI hospitalization percentages were decreased in 2007~2008, but female STEMI hospitalization percentages were not different from 1999 to 2008. However, NSTEMI hospitalization percentages were similar over the 10-year period. The hospitalization age for AMI, STEMI, and NSTEMI was increased over the 10-year period by 14, 9, and 7 years in male, and by 18, 18, and 21 years in female. The female and male hospitalization cost and lengths were similar in the period. As compared to nonmedical center, the hospitalization cost for STEMI in medical center was higher in male patients, but not in female patients, and the hospitalization cost for NSTEMI was higher in both male and female gender. We found significant differences between male and female, medical center and non-medical center, or STEMI and NSTEMI on medical care over the 10-year period."mycardial	EPI	"Socioeconomic status has a profound effect on the risk of having a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Information on socioeconomic inequalities in AMI incidence across age-gender-groups is lacking. Our objective was to examine socioeconomic inequalities in the incidence of AMI considering both relative and absolute measures of risk differences, with a particular focus on age and gender.We identified all patients with a first AMI from 1997 to 2007 through linked hospital discharge and death records covering the Dutch population. Relative risks (RR) of AMI incidence were estimated by mean equivalent household income at neighbourhood-level for strata of age and gender using Poisson regression models. Socioeconomic inequalities were also shown within the stratified age-gender groups by calculating the total number of events attributable to socioeconomic disadvantage.Between 1997 and 2007, 317,564 people had a first AMI. When comparing the most deprived socioeconomic quintile with the most affluent quintile, the overall RR for AMI was 1.34 (95â€‰% confidence interval (CI): 1.32-1.36) in men and 1.44 (95â€‰% CI: 1.42-1.47) in women. The socioeconomic gradient decreased with age. Relative socioeconomic inequalities were most apparent in men under 35â€‰years and in women under 65â€‰years. The largest number of events attributable to socioeconomic inequalities was found in men aged 45-74â€‰years and in women aged 65-84â€‰years. The total proportion of AMIs that was attributable to socioeconomic inequalities in the Dutch population of 1997 to 2007 was 14â€‰% in men and 18â€‰% in women.Neighbourhood socioeconomic inequalities were observed in AMI incidence in the Netherlands, but the magnitude across age-gender groups depended on whether inequality was expressed in relative or absolute terms. Relative socioeconomic inequalities were high in young persons and women, where the absolute burden of AMI was low. Absolute socioeconomic inequalities in AMI were highest in the age-gender groups of middle-aged men and elderly women, where the number of cases was largest."mycardial	REVIEW	"There are still considerable differences in the medication supply for men and women. While the prescription volumes for both men and women have, for some time, been similar or have even risen for the men, there are still characteristic differences between the sexes when it comes to the prescription of certain indication groups. Women are still prescribed clearly more drugs in the field of psychotropic medication, especially antidepressants, hypnotic drugs, and tranquilisers. As the American Beers criteria for quite some time now and, more recently, the German PRISCUS list have shown, the effects of such drugs are potentially dangerous, particularly for older women. The known adverse effects are, apart from dependence problems, restricted cognitive capacities, insecure or instable walking, and badly healing wounds from falling accidents that are followed by patient's nursing care dependency. In secondary prophylaxis after acute myocardial infarction, the characteristic prescription features of the various medicinal products that are used for both men and women (such as platelet aggregation inhibitors, beta-receptor blockers, ACE-inhibitors, statins) have become similar; women's still higher mortality risk appears to go back to the fact that too much time is spent before proper hospital treatment commences. In general, more attention should be paid to the right medication, the right length of treatment, and the right dosage of the medication prescribed to women; the evidence concerning women's supply of medicinal products should also be improved."mycardial	EPI	"The aim of the study was to examine associations between intake of macronutrients and dietary fiber and incident ischemic cardiovascular disease (iCVD) in men and women.We used data from 8,139 male and 12,535 female participants (aged 44-73 y) of the Swedish population-based MalmÃ¶ Diet and Cancer cohort. The participants were without history of CVD and diabetes mellitus, and had reported stable dietary habits in the study questionnaire. Diet was assessed by a validated modified diet history method, combining a 7-d registration of cooked meals and cold beverages, a 168-item food questionnaire (covering other foods and meal patterns), and a 1-hour diet interview. Sociodemographic and lifestyle data were collected by questionnaire. iCVD cases, which included coronary events (myocardial infarctions or deaths from chronic ischemic heart disease) and ischemic strokes, were ascertained via national and local registries. Nutrient-disease associations were examined by multivariate Cox regressions.During a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, we identified 1,089 male and 687 female iCVD cases. High fiber intakes were associated with lower incidence rates of iCVD in women and of ischemic stroke in men. In post-hoc analysis, we discovered statistically significant interactions between intake of fiber and saturated fat; these interactions also differed between men and women (p<0.001).In this well-defined population, a high fiber intake was associated with lower risk of iCVD, but there were no robust associations between other macronutrients and iCVD risk. Judging from this study, gender-specific nutrient analysis may be preferable in epidemiology."mycardial	MANAG	"In ST elevation myocardial infarction women received less evidence-based medicine and had worse outcome during the fibrinolytic era. With the shift to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) as preferred reperfusion strategy, the authors aimed to investigate whether these gender differences has diminished.Cohort study including consecutive ST elevation myocardial infarction patients registered 1998-2000 (n=15â€ˆ697) and 2004-2006 (n=14â€ˆ380) in the Register of Information and Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive care Admissions.1. Use of evidence-based medicine such as reperfusion therapy (pPCI or fibrinolysis) and evidence-based drugs at discharge. 2. Inhospital and 1-year mortality.Of those who got reperfusion therapy, pPCI was the choice in 9% in the early period compared with 68% in the late period. In the early period, reperfusion therapy was given to 63% of women versus 71% of men, p<0.001. Corresponding figures in the late period were 64% vs 75%, p<0.001. After multivariable adjustments, the ORs (women vs men) were 0.86 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.94) in the early and 0.80 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.89) in the late period. As regards evidence-based secondary preventive drugs at discharge in hospital survivors (platelet inhibitors, statins, ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and Î²-blockers), there were small gender differences in the early period. In the late period, women had 14%-25% less chance of receiving these drugs, OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.81) through 0.86 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.00). In both periods, multivariable-adjusted inhospital mortality was higher in women, OR 1.18 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.36) and 1.21 (1.00 to 1.46). One-year mortality was gender equal, HR 0.95 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.05) and 0.96 (0.86 to 1.08), after adding evidence-based medicine to the multivariable adjustments.In spite of an intense gender debate, focus on guideline adherence and the change in reperfusion strategy, the last decade gender differences in use of reperfusion therapy and evidence-based therapy at discharge did not decline during the study period, rather the opposite. Moreover, higher mortality in women persisted."mycardial	CLIN	"To evaluate gender differences in the prognostic value of renal function for mortality in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).Prospective single-center cohort.Single tertiary referral center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Patients consecutive STEMI patients undergoing PPCI (1412 men and 558 women).The authors calculated adjusted HRs for 3-year all-cause mortality according to the presence of a reduced renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min) using Cox proportional hazards models. In order to investigate a possible gender difference in the prognostic value of a reduced renal function, a comparison was made between the HRs of male and female patients and an interaction term was added to the model and tested for significance. Adjustments were made for age, body mass index, history of diabetes or hypertension, systolic blood pressure and heart rate, anterior myocardial infarction and time to treatment.In male patients, a reduced renal function was associated with increased 3-year mortality (adjusted HR 6.31, 95% CI 3.74 to 10.63, p<0.001). A reduced renal function was associated with a twofold increase in the mortality hazard in female patients (adjusted HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.94, p=0.006).In this large single-centre registry of STEMI patients undergoing PPCI, renal dysfunction as assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate had prognostic significance for mortality in both male and female patients."mycardial	Clinical	"Previous studies have shown gender differences in left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. Results are varied, however, and reliable, comprehensive data for changes in cardiac myocyte shape are not available.Young adult female and male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study and randomly assigned to the myocardial infarction and sham myocardial infarction groups. Myocardial infarction was produced by ligation of the left descending coronary artery. Four weeks after surgery, left ventricular echocardiography and hemodynamics were performed before isolating myocytes for size determination.In general, left ventricular functional changes after myocardial infarction were comparable. Females developed slightly, but significantly, more left ventricular hypertrophy than males, and this was reflected by the relative increases in left ventricular myocyte volume. In both males and females, however, myocyte hypertrophy was due exclusively to lengthening of myocytes with no change in myocyte cross-sectional area.This study demonstrates that post-myocardial infarction changes in LV function and myocyte remodeling are remarkably similar in young adult male and female rats."mycardial	Outcomes	"The aim of the present study was to investigate the gender-specific mortality after acute myocardial infarction in those aged < 70 years versus â‰¥ 70 years. The present study consisted of 2,677 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction who had undergone coronary angiography within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 1,810 patients < 70 years old and 867 patients â‰¥ 70 years old. Women were older and had a greater incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus and a lower incidence of current smoking and previous myocardial infarction in both groups. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly greater in women â‰¥ 70 years old age than in men â‰¥ 70 years old (16.2% vs 9.3%, respectively; p = 0.003) but was comparable between women and men in patients < 70 years old (5.7% vs 4.9%, respectively; p = 0.59). On multivariate analysis, the association between female gender and in-hospital mortality in patients â‰¥ 70 years old remained significant (odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidential interval 1.05 to 3.00), but the gender difference was not observed in patients < 70 years old (odds ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 2.24). In conclusion, female gender was associated with in-hospital mortality after acute myocardial infarction in patients â‰¥ 70 years old but not in patients < 70 years old."mycardial	Outcomes	"The greater mortality observed in women compared to men after acute myocardial infarction remains unexplained. Using an analysis of pairs, matched on a conditional probability of being male (propensity score), we assessed the effect of the baseline characteristics and management on 30-day mortality. Consecutive patients were included from January 2006 to December 2007. Two propensity scores (for being male) were calculated, 1 from the baseline characteristics and 1 from both the baseline characteristics and treatment. Two matched cohorts were composed using 1:1 matching and computed using the best 8 digits of the propensity score. Paired analyses were performed using conditional regression analysis. During the study period, 3,510 patients were included in the registry; 1,119 (32%) were women. Compared to the men, the women were 10 years older, had more co-morbidities, less often underwent angiography and reperfusion, and received less medical treatment. The 30-day mortality rate was 12.3% (130 of 1,060) for the women and 7.2% (167 of 2,324) for the men (p <0.001). The 2 matched populations represented 1,298 and 1,168 patients. After matching using the baseline characteristics, the only difference in treatment was a lower rate of angiography and reperfusion, with a trend toward greater 30-day mortality in women. After matching using both baseline characteristics and treatment, the 30-day mortality was similar for the men and women, suggesting that the increased use of invasive procedures in women could potentially be beneficial. In conclusion, compared to men, the 30-day mortality is greater in women and explained primarily by differences in baseline characteristics and to a lesser degree by differences in management. The difference in the use of invasive procedures persisted after matching by characteristics. In contrast, after matching using the baseline characteristics and treatment, the 30-day mortality was comparable across the genders."mycardial	Review	"Significant sex differences exist between men and women with regard to coronary artery disease. Most notably, this lethal disease kills more women than men each year and remains the leading cause of death for both men and women. Women and men clearly have different risk profiles when diagnosed with coronary artery disease and fare much differently after myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting. This review summarizes the sex differences in clinical presentation, diagnosis, and the surgical treatment of coronary artery disease between men and women; and potential multifactorial reasons for sex disparities are suggested."mycardial	Epidemiology	"In recent years, the prevalence of myocardial infarction (MI) has increased among women and decreased among men aged 35 to 54 years. To determine the extent to which changes in incidence account for recent variations in prevalence, we assessed the temporal trends in gender-specific hospitalization rates for MI. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified patients aged 35 to 64 years admitted to United States hospitals with a primary discharge diagnosis of MI from 1997 to 2006 (n = 2,824,615). The age-standardized MI hospitalization rates per 100,000 subjects were assessed for men and women aged 35 to 44, 45 to 54, and 55 to 64 years. The MI hospitalization rates per 100,000 subjects decreased by 26% from 168 to 126 for men and by 18% from 56 to 46 for women (both p <0.001). The reductions in the MI hospitalization rates were greatest among men aged 45 to 54, men aged 55 to 64, and women aged 55 to 64 years (standardized rates of change -3%, -4%, and -3% annually, p <0.001). The MI hospitalization rates decreased slightly for women aged 45 to 54 years and men aged 35 to 44 years (standardized rate of change -2% annually, p <0.001) and increased for women aged 35 to 44 years (standardized rate of change 2% annually, p = 0.008). In conclusion, from 1997 to 2006, men and women aged 35 to 64 years experienced an overall decrease in MI hospitalization rates; the reductions were more pronounced in men than in women. The slight increase in MI hospitalizations among women aged 35 to 44 years might have played a small role in the previously noted increases in MI prevalence among middle-age women."mycardial	Outcomes	"Factors contributing to the sex difference of in-hospital mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI) are still unknown. We compared the clinical characteristics on admission and in-hospital outcome of consecutive 1,354 patients with acute MI between the 2 sexes. Age on admission was about 7 years older in women than in men. In-hospital death was significantly more frequent in women. Pulmonary congestion and hypertension were more likely in women with higher serum levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. A higher prevalence of current smoking and inferior wall involvement and lower serum HDL cholesterol level were observed in man. After adjusting for age, adverse in-hospital mortality for women was observed in both younger and older patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age, location of infarction, recanalization and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration were independent predictors for in-hospital mortality for overall patients, while age and recanalization were independent predictors for male gender, and pulmonary congestion and serum CRP concentration were independent predictors for female gender. In-hospital outcome after acute MI was worse in women. A multivariate logistic regression model revealed that the sexually different factors affected in-hospital mortality in females."mycardial	Review	"Recognition of sex differences in symptom presentation of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is important for timely clinical diagnosis. This review examined whether women are equally as likely as men to present with chest pain.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of English language research articles published between 1990 and 2009.Meta-analysis showed women with AMI had lower odds and a lower rate of presenting with chest pain than men (odds ratio .63; 95% confidence interval, .59-.68; risk ratio .93; 95% confidence interval, .91-.95). Women were significantly more likely than men to present with fatigue, neck pain, syncope, nausea, right arm pain, dizziness, and jaw pain.Health campaigns on symptom presentation of AMI should continue to promote chest pain as the cardinal symptom of AMI, but also reflect a wider spectrum of possible symptoms and highlight potential differences in symptom presentation between men and women."mycardial	Outcomes	"Declining trends in case fatality (CF) of MI events have been generally reported in western countries. It is, however, not clear whether the development has been equally beneficial in both sexes. Data from two large population based registers, FINAMI and the Finnish National Cardiovascular Disease Register (CVDR) were used to determine whether the CF of incident MI events has declined less in women than in men. All patients aged 35 and over were included. CF was calculated for different time periods after the onset of the MI event, the main emphasis was in pre-hospital, 28-day, and 1-year CF. Figures were compared between two study periods: 1994-1996 and 2000-2002. A total of 6,342 incident MI events were recorded in FINAMI and 117,632 events in CVDR during the study periods. Comparison between the two study periods showed that the CF was generally declining. However, a slower decline in short-term CF was seen among young (aged<55 years) women (P for sex by study period interaction in pre-hospital CF=0.028 in FINAMI and 0.003 in CVDR, and for 28-day CF P=0.016 in FINAMI and <0.0001 in CVDR). In conclusion, the short and long-term prognosis of MI events has improved in both sexes. Pre-hospital CF has declined less among younger women than among men and among older women. This slower decline in early CF was responsible for the slower improvement in 28-day and 1-year prognosis in young women."mycardial	Outcomes	"Conflicting information exists about whether sex differences affect long-term outcomes in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).This retrospective study enrolled consecutive patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary PCI within 24 hours from symptom onset. Hazard ratios (HRs) of events with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated in the overall population and in a propensity score matched cohort of women and men.Among 481 patients, median age 66 years old, 138 (28.7%) were women. Women were older than men (72 vs 63 years, P<0.001), had a higher prevalence of hypertension (68% vs 54%, P=0.006), diabetes (27% vs 19%, P=0.04), and Killip classâ‰¥3 at admission (19% vs 10%, P=0.007). After a median follow-up of 1041 days women experienced a significant higher incidence of the composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure (31.9% vs 18.4%, unadjusted HR 1.86; 95% CI, 1.26-2.74; P=0.002), driven mainly by heart failure (unadjusted HR 2.47; 95% CI, 1.12-5.41; P=0.024), without significant differences in death (unadjusted HR 1.49; 95% CI, 0.88-2.53; P=0.13), or nonfatal myocardial infarction (unadjusted HR 1.59; 95% CI, 0.78-3.27; P=0.19) and no increase in target lesion revascularization (9.4% vs 12.5%, unadjusted HR 0.77; 95% CI, 0.42-1.44; P=0.42). After propensity score matching the hazard of the composite endpoint was largely attenuated (HR 1.32; 95% CI, 0.84-2.06; P=0.23).Women undergoing primary PCI experience worse long-term outcomes than men, but this difference is largely explained by their more adverse baseline cardiovascular profile."mycardial	Management	": While cardiac rehabilitation has been established as an essential part of comprehensive cardiac care, participation rates for female patients are substantially lower than for male patients. Lower referral rates and higher ages of female patients partly explain this underutilization. Gender differences in recovery goals of cardiac patients have not been examined.: Five hundred ninety patients (22.2% women) admitted to the hospital because of an acute myocardial infarction answered a questionnaire regarding 24 goals in 5 domains of recovery (physical functioning, risk-factor modification, psychological well-being, independence in daily life, and return to work). In addition, psychological symptoms and medical data were assessed. Gender differences were tested by using Ï‡ and Student t tests, as well as multivariate logistic and linear regression models.: Gender differences were found in 7 of the 24 recovery goals. After adjustment for psychosocial and clinical characteristics, women still reported a higher importance of ""performance of household duties"" (odds ratio [OR] = 8.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.43-13.66), ""independence in activities of daily living"" (OR = 2.38; CI, 1.58-3.59), and ""emotional equilibrium"" (OR = 1.58, CI, 1.01-2.46). Men rated ""physical endurance"" and ""reducing strain at workplace"" as more important goals (OR = 0.64; CI, 0.42-0.97 and OR = 0.39; CI, 0.17-0.93). Except for psychological distress, gender differences in health status were not related to differences in goals.: Gender roles and differences in social-life conditions may have an important influence on the recovery goals of patients after an acute myocardial infarction. Recovery goals should be explored when planning intervention programs for individual patients."mycardial	Clinical	"The Myocardial Infarction Network Essen was initiated in order to establish a standardized procedure with immediate reopening of the infarcted vessel for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the city of Essen, Germany. The present study aims to evaluate gender-related differences in presentation of disease and clinical outcome.Gender is associated with differences in presentation and outcome of STEMI.All patients with STEMI were included without exception. Parameters such as risk profile, mortality, and relevant time intervals were documented. The follow-up period was 1 year.For this study, 1365 patients (72.1% male) were recruited. Women were significantly older, with higher prevalence of diabetes (28.1% vs 20.3%, P = 0.004) and hypertension (76.5% vs 64.8%, P<0.0005). Analysis of time intervals between symptoms to actions showed no significant differences. However, women tended to wait longer before calling for medical assistance (358 vs 331 min, P = 0.091). In-hospital mortality was comparable with respect to gender, whereas women had higher 1-year mortality (18.6% vs 13.2%). Age and diabetes were associated with a higher mortality. Adjusted for age, gender is no longer an independent risk factor. In the follow-up period, significantly more women were readmitted to the hospital without a difference in the frequency of reangiography, surgery, or target-vessel revascularization.The present data display a successful implementation of a standardized procedure in patients with STEMI. Although differences between genders are not as obvious as expected, efforts should be taken to perform a gender-specific risk analysis as well as to promote education about proper behavior in case of new onset of angina."mycardial	Management	"The impact of gender on clinical course after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is not fully understood. We prospectively investigated whether there are gender-related differences in epicardial and myocardial tissue-level perfusion, both of which represent important prognostic determinants in STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).A total of 594 consecutive non-selected STEMI patients undergoing PPCI were prospectively enrolled. Primary end-point of the study was post-procedural epicardial and myocardial perfusion. Secondary end-points were the 30-day and 6-month composite occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE).Women with STEMI had higher risk factor profiles than men. Although PPCI achieved equal rates of successful epicardial reperfusion, women tended to have impaired microvascular reperfusion as reflected by lower rates of normal TIMI myocardial perfusion grade (P=0.007) and complete ST-segment resolution (P=0.079). After adjustment for the risk profiles, multivariable analysis showed that gender itself was not an independent predictor of impaired microvascular reperfusion. Both female gender and impaired myocardial reperfusion were independent predictors of 30-day MACE, whereas gender lost its prognostic significance for 6-month MACE. Multivariable analysis restricted to female patients identified incomplete ST-segment resolution as the strongest determinant of 30-day MACE.The differences in microvascular reperfusion after PPCI between women and men are attributed to higher risk profiles in women. Both female gender and impaired myocardial reperfusion were independent predictors of 30-day outcomes after PPCI, emphasizing the importance of successful microvascular reperfusion in the women with STEMI."mycardial	Clinical	"Many studies have examined gender-related differences in symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, findings have been inconsistent, largely because of different study populations and different methods of symptom assessment and data analysis. This study was based on 568 women and 1,710 men 25 to 74 years old hospitalized with a first-ever AMI from January 2001 through December 2006 recruited from a population-based AMI registry. Occurrence of 13 AMI symptoms was recorded using standardized patient interview. After controlling for age, migration status, body mass index, smoking, some co-morbidities including diabetes, and type and location of AMI through logistic regression modeling, women were significantly more likely to complain of pain in the left shoulder/arm/hand (odds ratio [OR] 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10 to 1.69), pain in the throat/jaw (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.21), pain in the upper abdomen (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.91), pain between the shoulder blades (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.77), vomiting (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.97), nausea (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.39), dyspnea (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.78), fear of death (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.72), and dizziness (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.91) than men. Furthermore, women were more likely to report >4 symptoms (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.72 to 2.66). No significant gender differences were found in chest pain, feelings of pressure or tightness, diaphoresis, pain in the right shoulder/arm/hand, and syncope. In conclusion, women and men did not differ regarding the chief AMI symptoms of chest pain or feelings of tightness or pressure and diaphoresis. However, women were more likely to have additional symptoms."mycardial	Clinical	"There is little epidemiological evidence regarding the association of impaired glucose metabolism with recurrent cardiovascular events. We therefore examined potential sex differences in the effect of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) on recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a community-based study of survivors of a first acute myocardial infarction (MI).This report focuses on 1226 incident MI cases (28.4% women) discharged alive from area hospitals in the Western New York Acute MI Study (1996-2004). Deaths and underlying cause of death were determined via query of the National Death Index (Plus) Retrieval Program with follow-up through December 31, 2004. Outcomes reported included fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or coronary revascularization surgery and total stroke. Traditional CHD risk factors and other explanatory variables were determined by clinical examination after the first acute event. Impaired fasting glucose was defined as fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125mg/dl. During a mean follow-up of 4.5 years, there were 91 recurrent events (26.1%) in women and 173 recurrent events (19.7%) in men. After multivariable adjustment, the hazard ratios for recurrent cardiovascular events were 1.96 (95% CI: 1.15-3.16) and 2.59 (1.56-4.30) in women with IFG and with diabetes, respectively, compared to normoglycemic women. Among men, neither IFG nor diabetes was independently related to risk of recurrence.In this study, IFG was a strong risk factor for recurrent cardiovascular events only among women. These results suggest that increased cardiovascular risk in MI survivors begins at lower glucose levels in women than men."mycardial	CLIN	"Gender differences in the clinical presentation and management of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have been reported in different parts of the world with contradicting results. We aimed at investigating the presence of gender bias in patients admitted with ACS to Aseer Central Hospital (ACH).A retrospective cohort of all consecutive patients admitted to ACH with the diagnosis of ACS, during the period between the 1st of June 2007 and the 31st of May 2009 was studied. Data on demographic and clinical profiles, management and outcomes of ACS patients were collected and compared for both genders.The present study included 148 females and 397 males. Females were significantly older than males (62.9Â Â±Â 14.2 vs. 60Â Â±Â 13.4, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.03), were less likely ever to have smoked (0.7% vs. 26.2%, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.001), less likely to have had a history of hyperlipidemia (10.8% vs. 22.2%, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.003) or family history of ischemic heart disease (10.1% vs. 18.9%, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.014). Female patients presented more with atypical presentation (42.6% vs. 28.9%, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.003), more with unstable angina (72.3% vs. 50.4%, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.001), and less with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (18.9% vs. 40.8%, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.001). Furthermore, they had significantly lower levels of hemoglobin compared to males (12.9Â Â±Â 2.3 vs. 14.5Â Â±Â 2.2Â g/L, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.001), and higher levels of high density lipoprotein (1.1Â Â±Â 0.4 vs. 0.98Â Â±Â 0.4Â mmol/L, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.008). Left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher in female patients compared to males (50.9Â Â±Â 14 vs. 45.8Â Â±Â 14, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.003). Coronary angiography showed a higher rate of normal findings (29.3% vs. 8.9%, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.001) and less severe disease (46.7% vs. 60.3%, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.027) in women, however, they were less likely to undergo invasive revascularization procedures (31% vs. 42.8%, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.013). No significant differences were found between both sexes regarding in-hospital mortality or re-infarction rates.We documented gender differences in both clinical presentation as well as management of patients admitted with ACS to ACH. However, there were no significant differences between both genders regarding the clinical in-hospital outcomes. Emphasis should be made to avoid such bias in the future."mycardial	Management	"over the last decade, there have been major changes in the treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Whether these have resulted in changes in sex differences in time to treatment is unknown. We examined temporal trends in time to reperfusion therapy among men and women with STEMI.the study includes 2 cohorts of STEMI patients presenting to a large metropolitan region during the periods August 24, 2000, to August 20, 2002 (Cohort1, n = 753), and August 25, 2006, to December 31, 2008 (Cohort2, n = 885).in both cohorts, compared with men, women were significantly older and had more comorbidities. Rate of emergency medical services use among women increased from 55% in Cohort1 to 66% in Cohort2 (P = .02). Median time from symptom onset to first medical contact was 84 minutes among men and 121 minutes among women (P < .01) in Cohort1 and 59 minutes among men and 81 minutes among women (P < .01) in Cohort2. Median door-to-balloon time was significantly longer among women compared with men in Cohort2. After multivariable adjustment, female sex was associated with a 34% (or 27-minute) increase in time from symptom onset to first medical contact and with a 23% (or 13-minute) increase in time from hospital arrival to reperfusion therapy.in the last decade, there have been significant reductions in patient and system delay, especially among women. However, women continue to have longer presentation and treatment times, suggesting that there continue to be opportunities for improvement."mycardial	CLIN	"To assess gender-related differences in the presentation, management, and in-hospital outcomes among acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients from Oman.Data were analyzed from 1579 consecutive ACS patients from Oman during May 8, 2006 to June 6, 2006 and January 29, 2007 to June 29, 2007, as part of Gulf RACE (Registry of Acute Coronary Events). Analyses were conducted using univariate and multivariate statistical techniques.In this study, 608 (39%) patients were women with mean age 62Â Â±Â 12 vs. 57Â Â±Â 13Â years (pÂ <Â 0.001). More women were seen in the older age groups (age <55Â years: 25% vs. 43%, 55-74Â years: 60% vs. 49% and >75Â years: 15% vs. 8%; pÂ <Â 0.001). Women had higher frequencies of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, angina, and aspirin use, but less history of smoking. Women were significantly less likely to have ischemic chest pain, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI and were more likely to have dyspnea, unstable angina, ST depression and left bundle branch block. Both groups received ACS medications and cardiac catheterization equally; however, women received anticoagulants (88% vs. 79%; pÂ <Â 0.001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (70% vs. 65%; pÂ =Â 0.050) more and clopidogrel less (20% vs. 29%; pÂ <Â 0.001). Women experienced more recurrent ischemia and heart failure but with similar in-hospital mortality (4.6% vs. 4.3%) even after adjusting for age (pÂ =Â 0.500).Women admitted with ACS were older than men, had more risk factors, presented differently with no difference in hospital mortality. This is similar to Gulf RACE study except for mortality. Women received anticoagulants/ACEIs /ARBs more but were under-treated with clopidogrel."mycardial	Outcomes	"Previous studies have documented gender-ethnic disparities in outcomes following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study evaluates such disparities in the Negev, Israel, and reviews potentially responsible mechanisms.Patients discharged with AMI were classified into young (<70 years), elders (â‰¥70 years) and gender-ethnicity groups: Female Bedouins (FB), Female Jews (FJ), Male Bedouins (MB) and Male Jews (MJ). The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. Prognosis was assessed using Kaplan-Meier approach. Multivariable analyses assessing hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression models in two steps controlling for (i) the Ontario Acute Myocardial Infarction Mortality Prediction Rules (OAMIMPRs) and (ii) the OAMIMPR and additional potential confounders.Of 2669 subjects, 45.8% were elders, 66.2% male and 10.9% Bedouin. The mortality rate was 12.3% (young 4.6%, elders 22%). Survival was significantly lower in FB compared with MB in the elderly stratum (P = 0.025). Multivariate analyses demonstrated similar risks for dying among the young. In the elders, the first multivariate analysis showed greater risk for mortality in FB. Using FB as the reference group, the HRs were as follows: HR((MB)) = 0.36 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14-0.9]; HR((FJ)) = 0.5 (95% CI: 0.27-0.9) and HR((MJ)) = 0.5 (95% CI: 0.28-0.91). In the second analysis, the HRs were as follows: HR((MB)) = 0.37 (95% CI: 0.14-0.93); HR((FJ)) = 0.58 (95% CI: 0.32-1.07) and HR((MJ)) = 0.56 (95% CI: 0.31-1.03).Elderly FB have poor 1-year prognosis following AMI compared with MB, MJ and FJ when controlling for the OAMIMPR model, yet when controlling for other potential confounders the differences are of borderline significance in relation to Jewish subjects. A culturally and economically sensitive programme focusing on tertiary prevention in these patients is warranted."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To investigate temporal trends in the risk of heart failure (HF) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to determine whether these trends differ by gender or age.The national Swedish hospital discharge and death registries from 1993 to 2004 were used to calculate age- and gender-specific trends for a first episode of HF within 3 years in 175 216 patients aged 35-84 and hospitalized with a first AMI. Overall, 14.4% of patients aged 35-64 and 31.5% of those aged 65-84 with AMI in 1993-1995 had a hospital diagnosis of HF within 3 years (including the index admission). Corresponding figures for patients with AMI from 2002 to 2004 were 11.5 and 28.0%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, the risk of HF decreased by 4% per year. Having had a stroke before admission increased HF risk by 37%, diabetes increased the risk by 76% and atrial fibrillation by 80%. Patients with any kind of valvular disease had a more than doubled risk. Women had a 6% higher incidence of HF than men, whereas men with an index admission for AMI who did not develop HF had higher mortality than women.In this national sample, we observed a steady decrease in the risk of being hospitalized with HF after an AMI. However, the 3-year risk of HF remains high, with nearly one-third of AMI patients aged 65-84 developing HF within 3 years."mycardial		"Contractile dysfunction is common to many forms of cardiovascular disease. Approaches directed at enhancing cardiac contractility at the level of the myofilaments during heart failure (HF) may provide a means to improve overall cardiovascular function. We are interested in gender-based differences in cardiac function and the effect of sarcomere activation agents that increase contractility. Thus, we studied the effect of gender and time on integrated arterial-ventricular function (A-V relationship) following myocardial infarction (MI). In addition, transgenic mice that overexpress the slow skeletal troponin I isoform were used to determine the impact of increased myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity following MI. Based on pressure-volume (P-V) loop measurements, we used derived parameters of cardiovascular function to reveal the effects of sex, time, and increased myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity among groups of post-MI mice. Analysis of the A-V relationship revealed that the initial increase was similar between the sexes, but the vascular unloading of the heart served to delay the decompensated stage in females. Conversely, the vascular response at 6 and 10 wk post-MI in males contributed to the continuous decline in cardiovascular function. Increasing the myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity appeared to provide sufficient contractile support to improve contractile function in both male and female transgenic mice. However, the improved contractile function was more beneficial in males as the concurrent vascular response contributed to a delayed decompensated stage in female transgenic mice post-MI. This study represents a quantitative approach to integrating the vascular-ventricular relationship to provide meaningful and diagnostic value following MI. Consequently, the data provide a basis for understanding how the A-V relationship is coupled between males and females and the enhanced ability of the cardiovascular system to tolerate pathophysiological stresses associated with HF in females."mycardial	Management	"Elderly patients are under-represented in trials assessing strategies of early coronary revascularization in acute myocardial infarction, though they are the fastest growing segment of our population. The aims of the present investigation, performed in 357 elderly (â‰¥75 years) patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) submitted to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) consecutively admitted to our Intensive Cardiac Care Unit (ICCU) from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2009, were as follows: (a) to identify predictors for in-ICCU mortality among clinical, angiographic and metabolic factors and (b) to evaluate whether there are gender-related differences in management, outcome and in the metabolic and inflammatory responses to acute myocardial ischemia. At multivariable backward stepwise logistic regression analysis, the following variables were independent predictors for in-ICCU mortality in the overall population: age (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.05-1.27; p < 0.003), admission glycemia (OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.41-3.56; p < 0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.88-0.97; p < 0.001), primary PCI failure (OR 4.70; 95% CI 1.70-12.98; p < 0.003). In elderly STEMI patients submitted to primary PCI, early mortality can be related to age, hemodynamic derangement (as indicated by LVEF), the rate of procedural success, and increased glucose values. No gender-related differences in management were detectable in our series. Our data strongly suggest that, in elderly patients in the acute phase of STEMI, since hyperglycemia is a modifying factor, glucose values deserve a more intensive treatment. Further studies, performed specifically in elderly STEMI patients, should be addressed to identify the glucose cut-off values able to influence the outcome."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To evaluate if female gender is associated with renal insufficiency in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and if there is a gender difference in the prognostic importance of renal insufficiency in STEMI.Single-centre observational study.One tertiary cardiac centre.All consecutive patients with STEMI planned for primary percutaneous coronary intervention in one Swedish county in 2005 (98 women and 176 men).Logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the predictors of renal insufficiency, associations between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and outcome in each gender and a possible interaction between gender and eGFR regarding outcome.Renal insufficiency was defined as eGFR less than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). 67% of women had renal insufficiency compared with 26% of men, OR 5.06 (95% CI 2.66 to 9.59) after multivariable adjustment. In women each 10 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) increment of eGFR was associated with a 63% risk reduction for 1-year mortality, OR 0.37 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.89). No such association was found in men, OR 1.05 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.76). A trend towards a significant interaction between gender and eGFR regarding 1-year mortality was found, OR 2.05 (95% CI 0.93 to 4.50).A considerable gender difference in the prevalence of renal insufficiency in STEMI was found and renal insufficiency seemed to be a more important prognostic marker in women. These results are important as previous STEMI studies have shown higher multivariable adjusted mortality in women than in men but renal function has seldom been taken into consideration."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"A case-control association study on 229 Myocardial Infarction (MI) patients and 217 healthy controls was carried out to determine the role of tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) (Alu-repeat insertion (I)/deletion (D)) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) (4G/5G insertion/deletion) polymorphisms with MI in the Pakistani population. In MI patients the genotype distribution of the PAI-1 gene was not found to be different when compared with the unaffected controls (P>0.05, Ï‡2=1.03). The risk allele 4G was also not associated with MI (P>0.05, Ï‡2=0.46, odds ratio (OR)=1.1 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.84-1.43), P>0.05). Similarly, the genotype frequencies of t-PA I/I, I/D and D/D were not different from the unaffected controls (P>0.05, Ï‡2=1.60), and the risk allele ""I"" was not found to be associated with MI (P>0.05, Ï‡2=1.35, OR=0.86 (95% CI=0.66-1.11), P>0.05). However, when the data were distributed along the lines of gender a significant association of the 4G/4G PAI-1 genotype was observed with only the female MI patients (P<0.05, z-test=2.21). When the combined genotypes of both the polymorphisms were analyzed, a significant association of MI was observed with the homozygous DD/4G4G genotype (P<0.01, z-test=2.61), which was specifically because of the female samples (P=0.01, z-test=2.53). In addition smoking (P<0.001, Ï‡2=13.52, OR=3.45 (95% CI=1.77-6.94)), diabetes (P<0.001, Ï‡2=22.45, OR=8.89 (95% CI=2.96-29.95)), hypertension (OR=7.76 (95% CI=2.88-22.68), P<0.001) family history (P<0.001, Ï‡2=13.72, OR=3.7 (95% CI=1.71-8.18)) and lower HDL levels (P<0.05) were found to be significantly associated with the disease. In conclusion the PAI-1 gene polymorphism was found to have a gender specific role in the female MI patients."mycardial	Outcomes	"Clinical outcomes in the treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) differ between men and women. The aim of the study was to compare results of STEMI management in a large multicentre national registry.A total of 456 hospitals (including 58 interventional centres) participated in the registry during one year. The study group consisted of 8,989 (34.5%) females and 17,046 (65.5%) males. Women were older (69.7 Â± 11 vs. 62 Â± 12 years; p<0.0001) and had more risk factors. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed significantly less in women (47.8% vs. 57.4%; p<0.0001). There was a longer time delay in women at each stage of treatment. The incidence of in-hospital complications was higher in women. In-hospital (11.9% vs. 6.9%; p<0.0001) and 12-months (22% vs. 14.1%; p<0.0001) mortality was significantly higher in women. In multivariate analysis pulmonary oedema, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, age, diabetes and anterior infarction significantly increased both in-hospital and long-term mortality. The in-hospital mortality was higher in the female group.Despite poor clinical characteristics, less than satisfactory management and a worse prognosis of STEMI in women, being a women itself is not a risk factor for increased long-term mortality, however, other well known risk factors affecting the prognosis relate frequently to the female gender."mycardial	Review	"Major gender differences exist in cardiovascular diseases and lead to different outcomes in women and men. However, attention and incorporation of sex-/gender-specific research might vary among disciplines. We therefore conducted a systematic review comparing publication characteristics and trends between stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) with respect to sex- and gender-related aspects.A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed to identify gender-/sex-related articles published for stroke and MI between 1977 and 2008. A specifically designed text mining program was used, and all literature was rated by two independent investigators. Publications were classified according to type of research performed, publication year, funding, geographical location, and gender of first and last authors.962 articles were retrieved and limited to 405 (42%) gender-relevant publications; 131 on stroke and 274 on MI. Type of performed research differed, especially in disease management, which received little attention (17%) in stroke, while representing the major focus in MI (40%). In both areas, clinical presentation received little attention (3 and 5%). Although publications progressively increased in both fields, an 8- to 10-year time gap emerged for stroke compared to MI. Last authors in both areas were predominantly men, but female last authorship is increasing more significantly over time in the field of stroke. Research on sex and gender differences in MI and stroke is largely underfunded, particularly by the EU.The data demonstrate how sex-/gender-specific research differs between specialties, most likely due to the diverse interest, funding opportunities and authorship distributions identified."mycardial	Review	"Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in most developed countries. Many studies revealed gender differences in the presentation, prevalence, and clinical outcomes of IHD. Compared with females, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is more often diagnosed in men. They also have a higher prevalence of IHD. These findings indicate that gender may have an important influence on IHD. Appropriate prevention, rapid diagnosis, and optimal treatment may essentially improve the care of all patients. It is therefore necessary to take into account gender differences in the features of IHD between males and females."mycardial	Management	"The role of gender differences in Health Related Quality Life (HRQL) in coronary patients is controversial, so understanding the specific determinants of HRQL in men and women might be of clinical importance. The aim of this study was to know the gender differences in the evolution of HRQL at 3 and 6 months after a coronary event, and to identify the key clinical, demographic and psychological characteristics of each gender associated with these changes.A follow-up study was carried out, and 175 patients (112 men and 63 women) with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or unstable angina were studied. The SF-36v1 health questionnaire was used to assess HRQL, and the GHQ-28 (General Health Questionnaire) to measure mental health during follow-up. To study the variables related to changes in HRQL, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were performed.Follow-up data were available for 55 men and 25 women at 3 months, and for 35 men and 12 women at 6 months. Observations included: a) Revascularization was performed later in women. b) The frequency of rehospitalization between months 3 and 6 of follow-up was higher in women c) Women had lower baseline scores in the SF-36. d) Men had progressed favourably in most of the physical dimensions of the SF-36 at 6 months, while at the same time women's scores had only improved for Physical Component Summary, Role Physical and Social Functioning; e) the variables determining the decrease in HRQL in men were: worse mental health and angina frequency; and in women: worse mental health, history of the disease, revascularization, and angina frequency.There are differences in the evolution of HRQL, between men and women after a coronary attack. Mental health is the determinant most frequently associated with HRQL in both genders. However, other clinical determinants of HRQL differed with gender, emphasizing the importance of individualizing the intervention and the content of rehabilitation programs. Likewise, the recognition and treatment of mental disorders in these patients could be crucial."mycardial	Clinical	"There is accumulated evidence that clinical course and prognosis after myocardial infarction (MI) may differ between genders.To compare epidemiology, the clinical course, therapeutic approach and prognosis in men and women with non-ST segment elevation MI (NSTEMI).We analysed a total of 1219 consecutive patients with NSTEMI (43% women) treated between June 01, 2005 and May 31, 2006 in a hospital covering in a district with 1,300,000 inhabitants. The data were obtained from the Polish Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes (PL-ACS).Women in the study group were on average 6 years older than men (72.6 Â± 10.3 vs 66.7 Â± 11.4 years; p < 0.0001). The incidence of arterial hypertension (83.4% vs 73.45%; p < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (30.2% vs 20.1%; p < 0.0001) and obesity (17.9% vs 13.1%; p < 0.020) was higher in women, while cigarette smoking was more common in men (7.4% vs 32.9%; p < 0.0001). Clinical presentation was similar in both genders. Coronary angiography was performed in 360 patients, more frequently in men (32.8% vs 25.2%; p < 0.05). Less women than men underwent percutaneous coronary angioplasty (18.9% vs 12.6%; p < 0.0033). In-hospital, 30-day and 6-month mortality was similar in both genders (5.3% vs 4.9%; 6.9% vs 7.3%; and 13.2% vs 13.1%, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, female gender did not influence the prognosis.Although women with NSTEMI had worse baseline characteristic and less frequently underwent revascularisation, their outcomes were comparable with those in men."mycardial	Management	"Many studies in high-income countries have investigated gender differences in the care and outcomes of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, little evidence exists on gender differences among patients with AMI in lower-middle-income countries, where the proportion deaths stemming from cardiovascular disease is projected to increase dramatically. This study examines gender differences in patients in the lower-middle-income country of Egypt to determine if female patients with AMI have a different presentation, management, or outcome compared with men.Using registry data collected over 18 months from 5 Egyptian hospitals, we considered 1204 patients (253 females, 951 males) with a confirmed diagnosis of AMI. We examined gender differences in initial presentation, clinical management, and in-hospital outcomes using t-tests and Ï‡(2) tests. Additionally, we explored gender differences in in-hospital death using multivariate logistic regression to adjust for age and other differences in initial presentation. We found that women were older than men, had higher BMI, and were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Women were less likely to receive aspirin upon admission (p<0.01) or aspirin or statins at discharge (pâ€Š=â€Š0.001 and p<0.05, respectively), although the magnitude of these differences was small. While unadjusted in-hospital mortality was significantly higher for women (OR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.54 to 2.87), this difference did not persist in the fully adjusted model (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.55 to 2.55).We found that female patients had a different profile than men at the time of presentation. Clinical management of men and women with AMI was similar, though there are small but significant differences in some areas. These gender differences did not translate into differences in in-hospital outcome, but highlight differences in quality of care and represent important opportunities for improvement."mycardial	Clinical	"To investigate gender differences in chest pain perception among Chinese patients with acute myocardial infarction.Thrombolytic therapy is beneficial to outcomes of acute myocardial infarction if administered within 12 hours from the onset of chest pain. However, cardiac symptom interpretation may impact time of presentation to hospital. Differences in cardiac symptom reports by gender partly explain misdiagnoses and delays in treatment, particularly among women. Whether, such trends apply to Chinese patients with myocardial infarction is unknown.A descriptive prospective study.Using questionnaires, data on demographic variables, the number of patients reporting chest pain and other chest sensations at the onset of acute myocardial infarction and chest pain intensity, description, location and radiation across the chest were collected.A total of 128 participants equally divided by gender were recruited. Chest pain was more prevalent among men than women (84.37% vs. 67.19%, p < 0.05). Although no statistical significance was found, Chinese men had higher mean chest pain intensity scores (7.54 SD 2.35 vs. 7.51 SD 2.25) and reported less atypical chest pain (0.00% vs. 9.3%) compared with women. Men had more upper right sided chest pain (40.74% vs. 20.93%, p = 0.038) whereas women experienced increased neck pain and pain to the upper central chest, middle central chest, upper central back, middle central back and middle right back regions.Discreet gender differences in chest pain perceptions exist between Chinese men and women, with the latter group, who may be considered as a high-risk group for missed and delayed diagnosis from myocardial infarction, reporting more atypical presentations.Irrespective of culture, women with myocardial infarction tend to present with atypical chest pain symptoms and therefore they should be aggressively investigated."mycardial	Management	"Several studies have found that among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated by thrombolysis, female sex is associated with a worse outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate sex-related differences in clinical and angiographic findings in patients with STEMI treated with primary angioplasty and Gp IIb-IIIa inhibitors. Our population is represented by 1662 patients undergoing primary angioplasty included in the EGYPT database. Myocardial perfusion was evaluated by myocardial blush grade and ST-segment resolution. Follow-up data were collected between 30 days and 1 year after primary angioplasty. Among 1662 patients, 379 were women (22.8%). Female sex was associated with more advanced age, higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, more advanced Killip class, longer ischemia time, less often smokers, with higher prevalence of preprocedural recenalization. No difference was observed in terms of postprocedural TIMI flow, myocardial perfusion and distal embolization. Similar findings were observed in terms of enzymatic infarct size and preprocedural ejection fraction. Female gender was associated with higher mortality (6.4% vs. 3.6%, HR = 1.83 [1.12-3.0], P = 0.015). However, the difference disappeared after correction for baseline confounding factors (HR = 1.01 [0.56-1.83], P = 0.98). This study shows that in patients with STEMI treated by primary angioplasty, female gender is associated with higher mortality rate in comparison with men, and this is mainly due to their higher clinical and angiographic risk profiles. In fact, female sex did not emerge as an independent predictor of mortality."mycardial		"Despite an increasing knowledge of the importance of triggering in cardiac events and their mortality and morbidity, awareness concerning the types of physical and psychological triggers is unsatisfactory. This study aimed to address the main daily triggers of typical chest pain as a marker of acute coronary syndrome onset and assessed the sex-related differences regarding these triggers among Iranians.A case-crossover study was conducted on 198 consecutive patients with a first event of acute myocardial infarction admitted to the coronary care unit of Shafa hospital in Kerman. Patients were interviewed about the baseline characteristics as well as potential triggers of chest pain experienced over the day before the diagnosed onset of disease. The start of diagnostic chest pain was used as a marker of disease onset. The hazard period was defined as 12-h period of onset of chest pain.Among probable triggers, only unsuspected sudden bad news and sexual activity had significant relationships with chest pain appearance during the hazard period. Among patients with the experience of bad news, the risk of chest pain occurrence during the hazard period was 6.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-31.8]. Also, among those who were exposed to sexual activity, this risk was 3.4 (95% CI 1.1-10.4). Risk of chest pain following bad news was specific to men with a risk of 9.9 (95% CI 1.1-87.6) and risk of event following sexual activity was specific to women with a risk of 13.3 (95% CI 1.4-120.9).Unsuspected sudden bad news can be an important trigger for acute cardiac events in men, whereas sexual activity can act as a strong trigger for these events among women. Counseling in high-risk groups should be focused on men with considerable sudden emotional stressors in their lives and also on women during the ages of active sexual function."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Among individuals with ischemic heart disease, young women with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) represent an extreme phenotype associated with an excess mortality risk. Although women younger than 55 years of age account for less than 5% of hospitalized AMI events, almost 16 000 deaths are reported annually in this group, making heart disease a leading killer of young women. Despite a higher risk of mortality compared with similarly aged men, young women have been the subject of few studies.Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients (VIRGO) is a large, observational study of the presentation, treatment, and outcomes of young women and men with AMI. VIRGO will enroll 2000 women, 18 to 55 years of age, with AMI and a comparison cohort of 1000 men with AMI from more than 100 participating hospitals. The aims of the study are to determine sex differences in the distribution and prognostic importance of biological, demographic, clinical, and psychosocial risk factors; to determine whether there are sex differences in the quality of care received by young AMI patients; and to determine how these factors contribute to sex differences in outcomes (including mortality, hospitalization, and health status). Blood serum and DNA for consenting participants will be stored for future studies.VIRGO will seek to identify novel and prognostic factors that contribute to outcomes in this young AMI population. Results from the study will be used to develop clinically useful risk-stratification models for young AMI patients, explain sex differences in outcomes, and identify targets for intervention."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Following myocardial infarction, the prognosis for females is better than males. Estrogen is thought to be protective, but clinical trials with hormone replacement failed to show protection. Here, we sought to identify novel mechanisms that might explain this sex-based difference. By diverging from the traditional focus on sex hormones, we employed a conceptually novel approach to this question by using a non-biased approach to measure global changes in gene expression following infarction. We hypothesized that specific gene programs are initiated in the heart following infarction that might account for this sex-based difference. We induced small, medium, and large infarcts in male and female mice and measured changes in gene expression by microarray following infarction. Regardless of infarct size, survival was better in females, while mortality occurred 3-10 days following infarction in males. Two days following infarction, males developed significant ventricular dilation, the best predictor of mortality in humans. Three days following infarction, we measured gene expression by microarray, comparing male versus female and sham versus surgery/infarction. In general, our results indicate a higher relative level of gene induction in females versus males and identified programs for angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune response. This pattern of gene expression was linked to less pathologic remodeling in female hearts, including increased capillary density and decreased fibrosis. In summary, our results suggest an association between improved survival and less pathologic remodeling and the relative induction of gene expression in females following myocardial infarction."mycardial	Epidemiology	"The prompt administration of coronary reperfusion therapy for patients with an evolving acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is crucial in reducing mortality and the risk of serious clinical complications in these patients. However, long-term trends in extent of prehospital delay and factors affecting patient's care-seeking behavior remain relatively unexplored, especially in men and women of different ages. The objectives of this study were to examine the overall magnitude and 20-year trends (1986 to 2005) in duration of prehospital delay in middle-aged and elderly men and women hospitalized with AMI.The study sample consisted of 5967 residents of the Worcester, Mass, metropolitan area hospitalized at all greater Worcester medical centers for AMI between 1986 and 2005 who had information available about duration of prehospital delay. Compared with men <65 years, patients in other age-sex strata exhibited longer prehospital delays over the 20-year period under study. The multivariable-adjusted medians of prehospital delay were 1.96, 2.07, and 2.57 hours for men <65 years, men 65 to 74 years, and men â‰¥75 years and 2.08, 2.33, and 2.27 hours for women <65 years, women 65 to 74 years, and women â‰¥75 years, respectively. These age and sex differences have narrowed over time, which has been largely explained by changes in patient's comorbidity profile and AMI-associated characteristics.Our results suggest that duration of prehospital delay in persons with symptoms of AMI has remained essentially unchanged during the 20-year period under study and elderly individuals are more likely to delay seeking timely medical care than younger persons."mycardial	Management	"Despite the benefits of prompt treatment of myocardial infarction, gender disparities exist in emergency department (ED) nurses' cardiac triage decisions.To determine the feasibility and utility of the aid to cardiac triage (ACT) intervention designed to improve ED nurses' cardiac triage decisions for women with myocardial infarction.A prospective, exploratory design was used. To determine feasibility, we evaluated the 1-hour time allocated for the intervention and ED nurses' participation rates. Twenty-three participants completed a utility questionnaire at the completion of the 1-hour intervention, and 18 participants completed the questionnaire 3 months post-intervention.The ACT intervention was delivered within 30 to 40 minutes, allowing 20 minutes for questions and discussion. ED nurses viewed the ACT intervention as a useful, helpful, and practical tool for improving their cardiac triage decisions at both intervention completion and 3 months later.The evaluation supports the feasibility and utility of the ACT intervention."mycardial	Management	"Previous studies indicate that mortality from acute coronary syndromes is higher in women than in men, especially in case of interventional strategy.To assess whether the in-hospital mortality rate differs between genders during the first 48h after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (emergency PCI-STEMI) or after non-emergency PCI.All patients treated with PCI between January 2005 and June 2008 were included. The primary endpoint was frequency of death within 48h after the PCI procedure; secondary endpoints included frequency of recurrent myocardial infarction, new PCI or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, stroke, and major vascular or renal complications. Data were analysed via logistic regression with and without propensity-score matching.More than 9000 patients underwent PCI. In the emergency PCI-STEMI group (n=1753), 48-hour mortality occurred in 2.2% of men and 4.9% of women (p=0.004). However, gender disparity occurred only in elderly patients; the rate was significantly (p=0.02) higher in women (8.1%) than in men (3.3%) aged > or =75 years. There was no evidence of gender disparity in the non-emergency PCI group (n=7336) or in secondary endpoints for either PCI group. Similar results were obtained in pair analyses of men and women with matching propensity scores.Elderly women have a disproportionately high in-hospital mortality rate during the first 48h after emergency PCI for treatment of STEMI; however, there is no gender discrepancy in younger patients or patients of any age who receive non-emergency procedures."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Clinical characteristics, including risk factors for thromboembolism, and medications differ between men and women with atrial fibrillation (AF) in Western countries. Whether such a difference exists for Japanese patients with AF is unclear, so data from J-TRACE were used to investigate this issue.A total of 2,892 patients (2,028 men, 864 women; 70.3 years old) with AF were analyzed for the respective prevalences of risk factors and medications. CHADS2 score was calculated to determine thromboembolic risk level. Women were older (P<0.001), and more frequently had heart failure (P<0.001), and hypertension (P=0.051) than men. The proportion of subjects aged 75 years or older was higher among women than among men (P<0.001). CHADS2 score was therefore significantly higher in women than in men (2.05+/-1.29 vs 1.88+/-1.33, P<0.001). Sex-related differences were not observed for the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, nor did warfarin usage differ between men and women.Sex-related differences were observed in the risk factor profile and medications of Japanese patients with AF. CHADS2 score was higher in women than in men."mycardial	Review	"Sex has a profound impact on myocardial remodeling, which is defined as the molecular and cellular events after an injury to the myocardium (i.e., necrosis, pressure overload, volume overload, and aging) leading to a change in shape, dimension, and function of cardiac chambers. Indeed, experimental studies and post-mortem and observational clinical studies suggest the presence of important differences in myocardial remodeling between females and males in response to different types of injures including aging, pressure and volume overload, and myocardial infarction. Interestingly, the remodeling process appears to be more favorable in women versus men; women are more likely to present heart failure with preserved systolic function and are at greater risk for low output syndrome acutely. These differences between men and women are widely held to be related to sex hormones such as estrogen, although the molecular effects of estrogen on ventricular cardiomyocytes are incompletely understood. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting these notions and discuss the underlying mechanisms and the clinical implications."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Previous data on young patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have indicated higher rates of normal coronary angiograms but higher mortality in women than men. However, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) differs from non-ST-elevation ACS in many aspects. We elucidated sex differences in risk factors, angiographic findings and outcome in consecutive STEMI patients below 46 years of age.Retrospective cohort study.The Swedish registers for CCU care and coronary angioplasty; RIKS-HIA and SCAAR.2132 STEMI patients below 46 years of age admitted to intensive coronary care units in Sweden between 1995 and 2006 and followed for at least 1 year.Angiographic findings and short-term and long-term mortality.Risk factors were more common in women. Significant coronary lesions were equally common (92.1% vs 93.1%, p=0.64) while single vessel disease was more common (72.9% vs 59.3%; p<0.001) in women. Women had higher multivariable adjusted in-hospital mortality, OR 2.85 (95% CI 1.31 to 6.19) while long-term mortality was the same, HR 0.93 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.45). The catch-up of mortality in men might be related to a higher occurrence of re-infarctions, HR 1.82 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.65).STEMI below age 46 is a more rare condition in women than in men and more often related to cardiovascular risk factors. More than 90% of both men and women had coronary lesions, in women more often single vessel lesions. Female sex is associated with higher in-hospital mortality, while long-term mortality is low without difference between genders."mycardial	Outcomes	"In the era of fibrinolysis, women suffered from higher early and late mortality rates than men after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been determined to be the most effective therapy strategy in STEMI. It is not clear if female gender is an independent predictor of a worse long-term prognosis among patients who were systematically treated with PCI. We, therefore, examined the effect of PCI on long-term outcome between women and men.Between 1999 and 2001, 500 consecutive patients at the Wuppertal Heart Centre were treated with PCI after acute STEMI. A long-term follow-up (up to 7 years) was achieved in 97% of the patients.In comparison to men, women were 7 years older (65 +/- 12 vs. 58 +/- 11) and had significantly more diabetes mellitus. The time between onset of symptoms and intervention tended to be longer in women than men. There was no difference in 30-day mortality (8.9% vs. 6.6%), cardiac late mortality (3.6% vs. 3.2%), and long-term cardiac overall mortality up to 7 years (12.1% vs. 9.6%). Stepwise regression analysis did not identify female gender as an independent predictor of late mortality. The quality of life was comparable.There was no gender-related difference in the long-term outcome if patients were sytematically treated with PCI in STEMI. PCI in STEMI has a long-lasting positive effect in women and should, therefore, be considered the treatment of choice for women with acute myocardial infarction."mycardial	Management	"Studies have suggested that women who present with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) may differ in their clinical response to early invasive strategy compared to male patients. We examined the impact of gender difference in NSTEMI patients on outcomes following invasive versus conservative treatment.Patients enrolled in our national myocardial infarction (MI) registry between January 2000 and September 2005 with diagnosis of NSTEMI were retrospectively analysed. The study endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in the patients at 1 year.A total of 1353 patients (62.2% male) with NSTEMI were studied. The mean age of men was 62 +/- 14 versus 72 +/- 12 years in women in the cohort (P <0.001). The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were significantly higher in women. Men were more likely to undergo revascularisation than women (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 2.18-3.89, P <0.001). Among those who were revascularised, there was no gender difference in survival or recurrent MI rates during hospitalisation and at 1 year. Compared to medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was associated with a significant reduction in MACE in both women (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.95) and men (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 4.79-12.75). The most important predictor of MACE for females was diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.17-3.33).There is a gender-based difference in the rate of revascularisation among patients with NSTEMI. Women benefit from an invasive approach as much as men, despite their advanced age, with similar rates of mortality and recurrent MI at 1-year follow-up."mycardial	Clinical	"Female sex and advanced age have adverse prognostic meaning in acute myocardial infarction. Whether gender and/or age influence the relationship between infarct size, infarct severity, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is unclear.We examined 460 patients (359 men) with acute myocardial infarction submitted to successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Infarct size, infarct severity, and LVEF were evaluated with perfusion gated SPECT at one month of index infarction.There were no significant correlations between age and infarct size or infarct severity, and between age and LVEF. Moreover, elderly age (>or=75 years) did not influence the relationship between LVEF and infarct size or infarct severity. Conversely, there was a significant gender-related difference in the relationship between LVEF and infarct size (F = 20.5, P < .00001), and between LVEF and infarct severity (F = 8.6, P < .005). In practice, there was a steeper decrease in LVEF in case of moderate to large infarct size in women than in men.With increasing infarct size, LVEF decreases more sharply in women than in men. Conversely, age does not influence the relationship between infarct dimensions and LVEF."mycardial	Outcomes	"To determine 28-day and 5-year survival rates in patients who have experienced a first acute myocardial infarction and to identify prognostic factors for survival.This study involved 1,677 patients with a first acute myocardial infarction who were treated at a hospital in Guipuzcoa, Spain between 1997 and 2000.Women were approximately 10 years older than men, presented more often with diabetes and hypertension, were in a less favorable clinical condition, and consumed fewer medical resources, but were less likely to smoke. Survival rates at 28 days and 5 years were higher in men over 60 years of age. In the period from 29 days to 5 years, the relative survival rate was higher in men from all age groups. Factors associated with short- and long-term survival varied between the sexes. Disease severity in the acute phase and, later on, age were associated with survival in both men and women, whereas the effect of other variables differed between the sexes.Myocardial infarction is a condition associated with high mortality in the acute phase. There is an interaction between sex and age that affects survival after an acute myocardial infarction. A number of factors are associated with poor short- and long-term prognoses in both sexes."mycardial	Clinical	"Fatigue is a symptom of acute myocardial infarction (AMI); however, few studies have characterized the fatigue associated with AMI in men and women.The convenience sample included 88 men and 28 women admitted with a diagnosis of AMI at 6 Midwestern facilities. Data were collected upon hospital admission and 30 days after discharge. A total of 37 men and 10 women responded to the 30-day questionnaires. The Profile of Mood States Fatigue (POMS-F) subscale was used to measure fatigue and the Depression-Dejection subscale to measure depressed mood.At baseline, significant gender differences were found, with women more likely to have higher POMS-F scores (15.80, SD = 7.33) than men (11.19, SD = 7.04, P = .004). Significant gender differences were also found at 30 days (t = 2.40, df = 45, P = .02). POMS-F scores for women were higher at baseline, with decreased fatigue levels 30 days after discharge (t = 5.36, df = 9, P < or = .05). No differences were found in POMS-F scores for men (t = 1.26, df = 36, P = .213) between baseline and 30 days after discharge. Fatigue was associated with depressed mood and gender at baseline (R(2) = 0.48, P < .05) and 30 days after discharge (R(2) = 0.308, P < .05).In this sample, fatigue at baseline and at 30 days after discharge was associated with gender and depressed mood. Women reported high levels of fatigue with AMI and lower fatigue after discharge. Men reported moderate to high fatigue levels, which did not change over time. Further research is needed to discern fatigue patterns before and after AMI."mycardial	Management	"In 2001-2002, the American Heart Association and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute initiated national campaigns with the aim of increasing women's awareness of their risk of heart disease, with particular focus on women aged 40 to 60 years. Our aim is to determine if these women's awareness campaigns were associated with a reduction in the time to hospital presentation for myocardial infarction in women.The study population comprised patients who presented with a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in the Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress ADverse Outcomes with Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines Registry and the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network-Get with the Guidelines registry. Analysis was done based on the introduction of the educational intervention: preintervention 2002-2003, intermediate 2004-2005, and post 2006-2007.Of 125,161 patients, 50,162 (40.1%) are women. The median time from symptom onset to presentation was significantly longer in women than men: 3 hours (interquartile range 1.4-7.6) versus 2.8 hours (interquartile range 1.3-7.2, P < .0001), a difference that remained significant after adjusting for clinical characteristics. There was no measurable reduction in the time from symptom onset to presentation over the period of the awareness campaigns: post- versus preintervention period (-0.18%, 95% CI -3.02% to 2.74%). After adjustment for covariates, women aged 40 to 60 years had a 3.46% longer time to presentation than men (95% CI 1.06-5.92, P = .005).There was no reduction in time from symptom onset to hospital presentation for myocardial infarction patients since national awareness campaigns in women were initiated, and a significant gender gap remains."mycardial	Clinical	"Few studies have addressed gender differences in evoking preconditioning. In an experimental study, it was reported that the preconditioning effect disappeared after gonadectomy.We sought to determine the effects of preinfarction angina (PA) on myocardial damage using intravenous contrast echocardiography.We studied 334 consecutive patients with anterior myocardial infarction (AMI) who underwent successful angioplasty. All patients underwent myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) 14 days after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Contrast defect was calculated as contrast defect area/myocardial area. Typical angina occurring in the 24-hour period preceding myocardial infarction was present in 133 patients (29 women) (group PA) and absent in 201 patients (43 women) (group non-PA). All women were postmenopausal.The contrast defect size and peak creatinine phosphokinase (max CPK) level in women were both significantly higher than that of men in group PA (18.3% +/- 6.3% vs 11.9% +/- 9.0%; P < 0.01 and 5000 +/- 599 IU/L vs 2672 +/- 221 IU/L; P < 0.005). The functional status of the myocardium among group PA, as expressed by risk area wall motion score index, was better in men than in women at 14 days (1.1 +/- 0.8 vs 1.7 +/- 0.8; P < 0.01) and at 6 months (0.7 +/- 0.4 vs 1.6 +/- 0.6; P < 0.01). However there were no significant gender differences in group non-PA. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the female gender (P < 0.05) was a significant independent predictor for microvascular damage.These findings suggest that preconditioning effects were attenuated in women with reperfused AMI."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Socioeconomic inequalities in the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) are well documented for men and women. CHD incidence is greater for men but its association with socioeconomic status is usually found to be stronger among women. We explored the sex-specific association between neighborhood deprivation level and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) at a small-area scale.We studied 1193 myocardial infarction events in people aged 35-74 years in the Strasbourg metropolitan area, France (2000-2003). We used a deprivation index to assess the neighborhood deprivation level. To take into account spatial dependence and the variability of MI rates due to the small number of events, we used a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach. We fitted hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate sex-specific relative and absolute MI risks across deprivation categories. We tested departure from additive joint effects of deprivation and sex.The risk of MI increased with the deprivation level for both sexes, but was higher for men for all deprivation classes. Relative rates increased along the deprivation scale more steadily for women and followed a different pattern: linear for men and nonlinear for women. Our data provide evidence of effect modification, with departure from an additive joint effect of deprivation and sex.We document sex differences in the socioeconomic gradient of MI risk in Strasbourg. Women appear more susceptible at levels of extreme deprivation; this result is not a chance finding, given the large difference in event rates between men and women."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Gender differences in cardiovascular disease have long been recognized and attributed to beneficial cardiovascular actions of estrogen. Class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) act as key modulators of heart disease by repressing the activity of the myocyte enhancer factor (MEF)2 transcription factor, which promotes pathological cardiac remodeling in response to stress. Although it is proposed that HDACs additionally influence nuclear receptor signaling, the effect of class II HDACs on gender differences in cardiovascular disease remains unstudied.We aimed to examine the effect of class II HDACs on post-myocardial infarction remodeling in male and female mice.Here we show that the absence of HDAC5 or -9 in female mice protects against maladaptive remodeling following myocardial infarction, during which there is an upregulation of estrogen-responsive genes in the heart. This genetic reprogramming coincides with a pronounced increase in expression of the estrogen receptor (ER)alpha gene, which we show to be a direct MEF2 target gene. ERalpha also directly interacts with class II HDACs. Cardioprotection resulting from the absence of HDAC5 or -9 in female mice can be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced neoangiogenesis in the infarcted region via upregulation of the ER target gene vascular endothelial growth factor-a.Our results reveal a novel gender-specific pathway of cardioprotection mediated by ERalpha and its regulation by MEF2 and class II HDACs."mycardial	Review	"Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in American men and women. Although there have been dramatic changes in the management of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) over the past several decades, a considerable proportion of patients with AMI continue to delay seeking medical care in a timely manner. This review provides an overview of the published literature that has examined age and sex differences in extent of prehospital delay in patients hospitalized with AMI.A systematic review of the literature from 1960 to 2008, including publications that provided data on duration of prehospital delay in patients hospitalized with AMI, was conducted. A total of 44 articles (42 studies) were included in the present analysis. The majority of studies showed that in patients hospitalized with AMI, women and older persons were more likely to arrive at the hospital later than men and younger persons. Several factors associated with duration of prehospital delay, including sociodemographic, medical history, clinical, and contextual characteristics differed according to sex.The elderly and women were more likely to exhibit longer delays in seeking medical care after the development of symptoms suggestive of AMI compared with other groups. Further research is needed to more fully understand the reasons for delay in these vulnerable groups."mycardial	Review	"The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the principal sex-related differences in the presentation, clinical course, and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias as well as the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying these differences.The mechanisms behind the sex differences in arrhythmias are not well understood yet. Recent studies in animals have provided some insight to explain the molecular basis by which sex hormones may be responsible for the female predisposition to long QT syndromes as well as the higher male predisposition to lethal arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. Recently discovered preferential transmission of long QT syndrome alleles to daughters as compared with sons, as well as sex differences in the activity of membrane transporters and in recently discovered myocardial cytochrome P450 enzymes, may explain the predisposition of women to acquired and drug-induced long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes. Important sex differences in the use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy have also been reported. Women appear to be underrepresented among patients who receive implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices. However, despite higher rates of adverse mechanical events, they seem to benefit at least as much as men from these therapies.Sex-related differences should be taken into account to provide optimal diagnosis and treatment to patients with cardiac arrhythmias. Further studies are needed to explain the mechanisms behind these differences."mycardial	Review	"Heart disease is the first killer of women in the modern era, regardless of age, race and of ethnicity, although its prevalence rises after menopause. Modern women have professional and housewife responsibilities, consume excess of fat and carbohydrates, smoke, do not exercise regularly and do not have enough time to rest. This situation leads to overweight, dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. Women do not often participate in preventive studies and still undergo less intensive and invasive evaluation and treatment for chest pain when compared to men. However, the rate of coronary death is twice higher in women than in men after myocardial infarction and revascularization procedures. The objective of this review is to analyze the main gender differences regarding symptoms, diagnosis, management and prognosis of coronary heart disease and to discuss the influence of hormonal replacement therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women."mycardial	Management	"Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is increasingly being used for unprotected left main (ULM) disease. Limited data are available on sex-related differences in this setting. We investigated gender-associated differences in patients undergoing stent-based PCI for ULM.We analysed baseline, procedural and long-term data of patients with ULM undergoing stent-based PCI at participating centres. The primary end-point was the long-term rate of major cardiovascular events rate (MACE, i.e., the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularisation). The study population included 1,452 cases, with 27.8% females and 72.2% males. Women were older, more frequently diabetic, hypertensive or presenting with an acute coronary syndrome, and thus with a higher EuroSCORE, but were less commonly treated with drug-eluting stents (DES), in comparison to men (all p<0.01). After a median follow-up of 18 months, women showed an unadjusted higher risk of death (p=0.040), cardiac death (p=0.033), and the death/myocardial infarction (p=0.012). However, after multivariable adjustment, gender was no longer an independent predictor of death (hazard ratio=1.119 [0.804-1.558]), cardiac death (hazard ratio=1.045 [0.697-1.567]), or death/myocardial infarction (hazard ratio=0.531 [0.192-1.465]), given the predominant role of age, diabetes and EuroSCORE as independent predictors and confounders of the gender-based comparison.Women undergoing PCI for ULM present more often with an acute coronary syndrome, are treated less frequently with DES, and have more adverse events, but these gender biases are not confirmed after adjusting for confounders. Thus, stent-based PCI for ULM offers similarly favourable clinical results in women as well as in men."mycardial	Management	"Women are at greater risk for worse outcomes associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) than are men. One explanation may be that they tend to be treated less aggressively than men even when more aggressive treatment is warranted. The purpose of this analysis was to assess this issue.We used the Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes with Early Implementation (CRUSADE) Quality Improvement Initiative registry, an observational data collection that began in November 2001, with retrospective data collection from January 2001 to December 2006. A total of 32,888 subjects met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for our study, based on strong biochemical evidence of myocardial infarction and acute onset of typical cardiac chest pain. We stratified subjects into 16 cells for coronary intervention, based on 4 age groups and 4 cardiac catheterization findings (insignificant, 1-vessel disease, 2-vessel disease, 3-vessel disease). We also stratified subjects into 20 cells for medical treatment, based on 4 age groups and 5 medical treatments. In each cell we compared the rate of coronary intervention (coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention) or medical treatment (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blocker, and statins) for men vs women.Men demonstrated significantly higher rates (P < 0.05) of coronary intervention in 7 of the 16 cells and 9 of the 20 medical treatment cells, compared to no cells in which women had statistically higher rates than men.These findings suggest that men are more likely than women to receive coronary intervention and to be medically treated when presenting with evidence of non-ST-segment myocardial infarction, controlled for age, cardiac catheterization findings, and biochemical evidence of myocardial infarction."mycardial	Outcomes	"The aim of this study was to investigate gender-specific short- and long-term mortalities after a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). The study was based on 505 men and 196 women with DM and 1,327 men and 415 women without DM consecutively hospitalized with a first-ever AMI from January 1998 to December 2003 recruited from a population-based MI registry. Patients were followed until December 31, 2005 (median follow-up time 4.3 years). In men and women, no significantly independent association between DM and short-term mortality was observed. After multivariable adjustment odds ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for 28-day case fatality were 1.45 (95% CI 0.90 to 2.34) in men with DM compared to men without DM and 1.44 (95% CI 0.66 to 3.15) in women with DM compared to women without DM. Conversely, in 28-day AMI survivors DM was significantly associated with long-term mortality in age-adjusted analyses, in which men with DM had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.57 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.10) for all-cause mortality compared to non-DM men; the corresponding HR in women with DM was 2.91 (95% CI 1.82 to 4.65). After multivariable adjustment the strong association in women with DM remained significant (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.27); however, in men with DM it became borderline significant (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.85). In conclusion, short-term mortality was not significantly increased in men and women with DM after a first-ever AMI, although estimates were relatively high, indicating a possible relation. However, long-term mortality was higher in patients with AMI and DM, particularly in women."mycardial	Clinical	"Digit ratios, such as the second to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D), are biometric markers that are influenced by estrogen and testosterone concentrations in utero and are determined genetically by HOX genes (homeodomain-containing homeotic genes). Sex steroids also play a crucial role in the occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), which is considered to be gender dependent and related to testosterone. Additionally, first-trimester exposure to excess levels of estrogens and progesterone has been linked to cardiovascular anomalies.The aim of this work was to study digit ratios in a Greek population and assess their clinical importance as markers of predisposition to MI.Two samples were used: a group of Greek men and women hospitalized with MI, and a control group of healthy Greek men and women of the same age. Finger lengths were measured twice for both hands using electronic calipers. In the results, digits were designated as 2D (second digit), 3D (third digit), 4D (fourth digit), and 5D (fifth digit).A total of 50 Greek men and 50 Greek women with MI were recruited (mean [SD] age, 69.3 [11.2] years for men; 69.7 [11.0] years for women). The control group consisted of 40 healthy Greek men and 40 healthy Greek women (mean age, 68.0 [11.8] years for men; 66.8 [10.7] years for women). In the control group, 2D:4D, 2D:3D, and 2D:5D ratios were significantly higher in women than in men (2D:4D: right hand, P < 0.001; left hand, P = 0.002; 2D:3D: right hand, P < 0.001; left hand, P = 0.003; 2D:5D: right hand, P < 0.001; left hand, P < 0.05). The mean values of 2D:4D ratios appeared to increase in the following order: healthy men < men with MI < healthy women < women with MI, although this difference was not statistically significant. In men with MI, 2D:4D and 3D:4D ratios were significantly higher than the respective ratios in healthy men (2D:4D: right hand, P = 0.001; left hand, P < 0.05; 3D:4D: right hand, P < 0.05; left hand, P = 0.001), but no significant differences were observed in the ratios between women with MI and healthy women.Digit ratios that include ring-finger length (ie, 4D) may be useful biomarkers for predisposition to MI in Greek men, but not in Greek women. Sexual dimorphism of digit ratios was present in both groups and was independent of the individuals' health status."mycardial	Management	"HISTORIQUE : Les Ã©tudes menÃ©es au tournant du siÃ¨cle faisaient Ã©tat de diffÃ©rences de taux d'interventions selon les sexes.

RÃ‰SULTATS : Les taux de cathÃ©tÃ©rismes coronaires au bout de 90 jours ont considÃ©rablement augmentÃ© pendant la pÃ©riode de l'Ã©tude, tant chez les hommes que chez les femmes (P<0,0001 en matiÃ¨re de tendance), l'augmentation Ã©tant plus marquÃ©e Ã  compter de septembre 2000. Les femmes Ã©taient moins susceptibles de subir un cathÃ©tÃ©risme que les hommes, mÃªme aprÃ¨s rajustement des diffÃ©rences de dÃ©part. Cet effet attribuable au sexe changeait selon l'Ã¢ge et les soins Ã  l'unitÃ© de soins intensifs ou de soins cardiaques (USI-USC). Notamment, l'hospitalisation Ã  l'USI-USC Ã©liminait la diffÃ©rence selon les sexes chez les patients de moins de 65 ans. Sous rÃ©serve d'avoir reÃ§u un cathÃ©tÃ©risme cardiaque aprÃ¨s l'IAM, le sexe fÃ©minin ne s'associait pas Ã  une diminution de la probabilitÃ© d'avoir reÃ§u une revascularisation au bout d'un an (FC 0,96; 95 % IC 0,91 Ã  1,02). CONCLUSIONS : MalgrÃ© l'augmentation rÃ©cente du taux de cathÃ©tÃ©risme aprÃ¨s un IAM, les femmes Ã©taient moins susceptibles de subir un cathÃ©tÃ©risme que les hommes. Fait intÃ©ressant, l'accÃ¨s Ã  l'USI-USC faisait disparaÃ®tre la diffÃ©rence d'accÃ¨s au cathÃ©tÃ©risme chez les patients de moins de 65 ans.Studies before the turn of the century reported sex differences in procedure rates. It is unknown whether these differences persist.To examine time trends and sex differences in coronary catheterization and revascularization following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients 20 years of age or older who were admitted to hospital in British Columbia with an AMI between April 1, 1994, and March 31, 2003. Segmented regression analysis was used to examine the inflection point of the time trend in 90-day catheterization rates post-AMI. Multivariable Cox regression modelling was used to evaluate sex differences in receiving catheterization and revascularization following AMI.Ninety-day coronary catheterization rates increased significantly over the study period for both men and women (P<0.0001 for trend), with a steeper increase beginning in September 2000. Women were less likely to undergo catheterization than men, even after adjustment for baseline differences; this sex effect was modified by age and care in the intensive care unit or cardiac care unit (ICUâ„CCU). Specifically, ICUâ„CCU admission eliminated the sex difference among patients who were younger than 65 years of age. Conditional on receiving cardiac catheterization post-AMI, female sex was not associated with a lower likelihood of receiving revascularization within one year (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02).Despite recent increases in catheterization rates post-AMI, women were less likely to undergo catheterization than men. Interestingly, access to ICUâ„CCU care removed the sex difference in catheterization access in patients younger than 65 years of age."mycardial	Outcomes	"To investigate the impact of gender on outcomes in patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome undergoing intervention treatment.In a multi-center randomized trial, the patients diagnosed as non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome were randomly assigned to undergo early intervention (coronary angiography â‰¤ 24 h after randomization) or delayed intervention (coronary angiography â‰¥ 36 h after randomization). The primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction or stroke at 180 days. The secondary outcomes were death, myocardial infarction, refractory ischemia, stroke or revascularization at 180 days.Among 815 patients (545 males, 270 females), the incidences of primary and secondary outcome were equivalent for both genders (P > 0.05). Males of the early intervention group had a greater incidence of the primary outcome (7.1% vs 14.8%, P = 0.00). The secondary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction or refractory ischemia occurring in 12.5% of males in early intervention group and 21.2% in delayed intervention group. Significant difference existed (P = 0.00). The incidence of another secondary outcome as a composite of death, myocardial infarction, refractory ischemia, stroke or revascularization was equivalent for males in early intervention group and delayed intervention group (26.8% vs 32.4%, P > 0.05). The incidences of primary outcome (12.6% vs 14.3%, P > 0.05) and secondary outcome (18.5% vs 23.5% P > 0.05; 28.5% vs 27.7% P > 0.05) were equivalent for females in early intervention group and delayed intervention group (P > 0.05).Patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome undergoing intervention demonstrate no significant gender differences in efficacy and safety. Early intervention reduces the rate of myocardial infarction for males, but it is not superior to delayed intervention for females."mycardial	Review	"Many investigators have reported higher rates of cardiac procedures for males than females after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), suggesting that men are treated more aggressively than women. However, others have reported no significant differences after controlling for age, resulting in uncertainty about the existence of a true gender bias in cardiac care. In this study, a population-based cohort approach was used to calculate age-specific procedure rates by sex from administrative data. Chi-square tests and generalized linear modelling were used to assess gender differences and interactions. For all four procedures studied, rates were significantly higher for males than females (p<0.01). However, age-specific rates revealed few significant differences by gender and a sharp decrease in intervention rates with age for both males and females. Generalized linear modelling confirmed that patient age was a significant predictor of intervention rates, whereas sex was not. The significant gender difference in overall rates was completely confounded by the older age profile of female AMI patients compared to their male counterparts."mycardial	Outcomes	"Studies have suggested that women are biologically different and that female gender itself is independently associated with poor clinical outcome after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).We analyzed data from the Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry (KAMIR) to assess gender differences in in-hospital outcomes post ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).Between November 2005 and July 2007, 4037 patients who were admitted with STEMI to 41 facilities were registered into the KAMIR database; patients admitted within 72 hours of symptom onset were selected and included in this study.The proportion of patients who had reperfusion therapy within 12 hours from chest pain onset was lower in women. Women had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (8.6% vs 3.2%, P < .01), noncardiac death (1.5% vs 0.4%, P < .01), cardiac death (7.1% vs 2.8%, P < .01), and stroke (1.2% vs 0.5%, P < .05) than men. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified age, previous angina, hypertension, a Killip class > or = II, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%, and a thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow (TIMI) grade < or = 3 after angioplasty as independent risk factors for in-hospital death for all patients; however, female gender itself was not an independent risk factor.The results of this study show that although women have a higher in-hospital mortality than men, female gender itself is not an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality."mycardial	Management	"Randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated the superiority of sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as opposed to bare-metal stents, in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This study aimed to test the hypothesis that clinical benefits of SES treatment were independent of gender in this setting.A total of 2042 patients with STEMI undergoing SES-based primary PCI were prospectively enrolled into Shanghai Acute Coronary Event (SACE) registry (1574 men and 468 women). Baseline demographics, angiographic and PCI features, and in-hospital and 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were analyzed as a function of gender.Compared with men, women were older and more frequently had hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Use of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor (GPI, 65.5% vs. 62.2%, P = 0.10) and procedural success rate (95.0% vs. 94.2%, P = 0.52) were similar in both genders. In-hospital death and MACE occurred in 3.8% and 7.6%, and 4.5% and 8.1% in the male and female patients, respectively (all P > 0.05). At 30-day follow-up, survival (94.3% vs. 93.8%, P = 0.66) and MACE-free survival (90.2% vs. 89.3%, P = 0.52) did not significantly differ between men and women. After adjustment for differences in patient demographics, angiographic and procedural features, there were no significant difference in either in-hospital (OR = 0.77, 95%CI of 0.48 to 1.22, P = 0.30) or 30-day mortality (OR = 1.28, 95%CI of 0.73 to 2.23, P = 0.38) between women and men.Despite more advanced age and clustering of risk factors in women, female patients with STEMI treated by SES-based primary PCI had similar in-hospital and short-term clinical outcomes as their male counterparts."mycardial	Outcomes	"We investigated whether the time of sunrise and the number of daylight hours have an effect on the seasonality, or the daily rhythm of heart attack mortality. We analyzed retrospectively data of patients admitted to hospitals with the diagnosis of heart attack (n=32,329) and patients who deceased of a heart attack (n=5142) between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005 in Hungary. Heart attack mortality was highest during winter, while lowest number of events was recorded during summer . The daily peak of diurnality was between 6:00 am and 12:00 pm (33.77%). A positive correlation was found between the time of sunrise, time of sunset and the mortality caused by myocardial infarction (p<0,01). In the analysis of the number of daylight hours and the heart attack mortality we found a negative correlation (r=-0.105, p<0.05). No significant difference was found between sexes and different age-groups in heart attack mortality. Our data suggest, that the occurrence and the mortality of heart attack may be related to the time of sunrise and the number of daylight hours."mycardial	Management	"Prior studies have shown a relationship between female gender and adverse outcomes after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). Whether this relationship still exists with contemporary PCI remains to be determined.We evaluated gender differences in clinical outcomes in a large registry of contemporary PCI. Data were prospectively collected from 22,725 consecutive PCIs in a multicenter regional consortium (Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium) between January 2002 and December 2003. The primary end point was in-hospital all-cause mortality; other clinical outcomes evaluated included in-hospital death, vascular complications, transfusion, postprocedure myocardial infarction, stroke, and a combined major cardiovascular adverse event (MACE) end point including myocardial infarction, death, stroke, emergency coronary artery bypass grafting, and repeated PCI at the same site. Independent predictors of adverse outcomes were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis.Compared with men, women were older, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, and had a significantly higher frequency of adverse outcomes after PCI. After adjustment for baseline demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and lesion characteristics, female gender was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death, vascular complication, blood transfusion, stroke, and MACE. The relationship between female gender and increased risk of death and MACE was no longer present after further adjustment for kidney function and low body surface area.Differences in mortality rates between men and women no longer exist after PCI. However, our data suggest that technological advancements have not completely offset the relationship between gender and adverse outcomes after PCI."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Numerous studies were focused on coronary artery disease, most of them in the male population and it seems that data on gender differences in CAD were extrapolated from these studies.The multi-center prospective study was designed to analyze gender differences in features, clinical presentation, and early in-hospital mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) admitted to coronary units in 50 hospitals in Serbia, during a 12 month-period.The data were collected from the central register of ACS, analyzed with respect to gender differences. The study protocol included all consecutive patients with diagnosis of ACS. In the study 12,094 patients were analyzed, 7639 men and 4455 women. Women were significantly older than men in all ACS manifestations (p < 0.001).Incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) in women was the highest between the 7th and 8th life decade, while in men the highest incidence is observed between their sixties and seventies. Equalization in the incidences of MI in men and women is observed between the sixth and seventh life decades. There were significant differences in the incidence of fibrinolytic therapy and heart failure (p < 0.001) in favor of women. Women with unstable angina and NSTEMI had higher in-hospital mortality (2.4% vs. 1.7% and 9.0% vs. 7.1%, respectively), without statistical significance, while in STEMI the difference was highly statistically significant (16.1% compared to men 10.1), p < 0.001.The mean age of the greatest frequency of occurrence of MI has been shifted five years earlier in the population of women, different from other studies related to the analysis of MI by gender differences.Female mortalitywas significantly higher compared to the male population, thus more aggressive therapy should be administrated."mycardial	Management	"To analyze the in-hospital complication rate in women suffering from non-ST elevation myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to men.The files of 479 consecutive patients (133 women and 346 men) suffering from a Non STEMI (Non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) between the January 1st 2006 and March 21st 2009 were retrospectively analyzed with special attention to every single complication occurring during hospital stay. Data were analyzed using nonparametric tests and are reported as median unless otherwise specified. A p value < .05 was considered significant.As compared to men, women were significantly older (75.8 vs. 65.2 years; p < .005). All cardiovascular risk factors but tobacco and hypertension were similar between the groups: men were noticeably more often smoker (p < .0001) and women more hypertensive (p < .005). No difference was noticed for pre-hospital cardiovascular drug treatment. However women were slightly more severe at entry (more Killip class IV; p = .0023; higher GRACE score for in-hospital death - p = .008 and CRUSADE score for bleeding - p < .0001). All the patients underwent PCI of the infarct-related artery after 24 or 48 hrs post admission without sex-related difference either for timing of PCI or primary success rate. During hospitalization, 130 complications were recorded. Though the event rate was slightly higher in women (30% vs. 26% - p = NS), no single event was significantly gender related. The logistic regression identified age and CRP concentration as the only predictive variables in the whole group. After splitting for genders, these parameters were still predictive of events in men. In women however, CRP was the only one with a borderline p value.Our study does not support any gender difference for in-hospital adverse events in patients treated invasively for an acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation and elevated troponin."mycardial	Management	"The widespread use of primary coronary intervention (PCI) has significantly improved the prognosis of men presenting with acute coronary syndromes, but the cardiovascular event rate among women has either levelled off or increased. The purpose of the present prospective study was to compare the clinical outcome of women and men presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI with concomitant usage of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.Between January 2006 and December 2007, 297 consecutive patients presenting with STEMI were prospectively included in this single center investigation. Overall, 82 (27.6%) women and 215 (72.4%) men were treated by PCI with additional bare metal stent implantation and a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor.Women were significantly older (65 Â± 10 vs 60 Â± 12 years, p = 0.04), presented with a smaller reference luminal diameter (2.83 Â± 0.51 vs 2.94 Â± 0.43, p = 0.03) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (68% vs 53%, p = 0.025) and obesity (30% vs 18%, p = 0.03). The incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE, defined as death, re-myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization and coronary artery bypass graft) during long-term follow-up was similar in women and men (20% vs 26%, p = 0.29). Age, C-reactive protein, platelet count and cardiogenic shock were identified as independent predictors for MACE, whereas gender was not predictive.In this study, female gender did not emerge as an independent predictor for MACE, but women presenting with STEMI had a higher cardiovascular risk profile; this emphasizes the need for a more extensive therapeutic strategy. Combination therapy with primary PCI and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors might mitigate gender-related differences in clinical outcomes."mycardial	Epidemiology	"As populations in Western countries continue to change in their ethnic composition, there is a need for regular surveillance of diseases that have previously shown some health disparities. Earlier data have already demonstrated high rates of cardiovascular mortality among South Asians and relatively lower rates among people of Chinese descent. The aim of this study was to describe the differences in the incidence of hospitalized acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among the three largest ethnic groups in British Columbia (BC), Canada.Using hospital administrative data, we identified all patients with incident AMI in BC between April 1, 1995, and March 31, 2002. Census data from 2001 provided the denominator for the entire BC population. Ethnicity was determined using validated surname analysis and applied to the census and hospital administrative datasets. Direct age standardization was used to compare incidence rates.A total of 34,848 AMI cases were identified. Among men, South Asians had the highest age standardized rate of AMI hospitalization at 4.97/1000 population/year, followed by Whites at 3.29, and then Chinese at 0.98. Young South Asian men, in particular, showed incidence rates that were double that of young Whites and ten times that of young Chinese men. South Asian women also had the highest age-standardized rate of AMI hospitalization at 2.35/1000 population/year, followed by White women (1.53) and Chinese women (0.49).South Asians continue to have a higher incidence of hospitalized AMI while incidence rates among Chinese remain low. Ethnic differences are most notable among younger men."mycardial	OUTC	mycardial	Pathophysiology	"This study sought to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of the novel hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (cTnI) prototype assay from Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, California).Studies on patients with acute coronary syndromes and on seemingly healthy subjects have shown that even very minor elevations of cardiac troponins are associated with an increased risk of death. However, the normal plasma levels of cardiac troponins are still not known.cTnI plasma levels were measured in 542 healthy subjects, 319 men (age 59.9 +/- 11.8 years) and 213 women (age 59.8 +/- 13.1 years), and in 1,503 randomly selected patients of the GUSTO IV (Global Utilization of Strategies To open Occluded arteries IV) cohort with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (MIs).The cTnI levels at 10% coefficient of variation and 20% coefficient of variation imprecision were 0.0033 and 0.0016 microg/l, respectively. The cTnI levels were measurable in >95% of the healthy subjects. The median level of healthy subjects <60 years of age was 0.0032 microg/l (range 0.0011 to 0.0079 microg/l) with the 99th percentile being 0.010 microg/l. No sex differences were observed. A receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis showed an optimal discrimination between healthy subjects and patients at 0.0064 microg/l with a sensitivity of 84.8% (95% confidence interval: 82.8% to 86.6%) and specificity of 89.7% (95% confidence interval: 86.8% to 92.2%). Outcomes as to death and/or MI were significantly different at this level (p < 0.01) in the GUSTO IV cohort.The novel high-sensitivity cTnI prototype assay from Beckman Coulter allows for the first time the measurement of cTnI levels in almost all healthy subjects. Our data indicate that the assay may be a powerful aid in the diagnosis and outcome prediction of patients with suspected myocardial ischemia and question any definition of myocardial infarction."mycardial	Management	"The influence of age and comorbidities on sex-specific implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) use for primary or secondary prevention is undefined.The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of age and comorbidities on sex-specific ICD use.Sex disparities and sex-specific trends in ICD implantation according to indication in patients with cardiac arrest (1998-2007) in Ontario, Canada, were examined. Use of ICDs for primary prevention in patients with myocardial infarction (2002-2007) or heart failure (2005-2007) also was examined.Among 9,246 eligible secondary prevention patients (age 66.3 +/- 14.3 years; 3,577 women [39%]) with cardiac arrest, men were more likely to undergo ICD implantation, with an age-, comorbidity-, and arrhythmia-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.66-2.23). Among 105,516 patients with myocardial infarction (age 68.3 +/- 12.7 years; 42,987 women [41%]), men were threefold more likely to undergo ICD implantation, with an adjusted HR of 3.00 (95% CI: 2.53-3.55). Among 61,160 patients with heart failure (age 76.2 +/- 12.0 years; 31,575 women [52%]), ICD implantation was more likely in men, with an adjusted HR of 3.01 (95% CI: 2.59-3.50). The odds of ICD implant for secondary prevention increased over time by 21% (95% CI: 13%-30%) in women and by 6% (95% CI: 2%-11%) in men, but rates of ICD use in men for primary prevention indications were persistently higher.Men were more likely to undergo defibrillator implant than were women for primary and secondary prevention. Age and comorbidities did not account for the observed sex differences. Although sex differences in secondary prevention are declining over time, disparities in primary prevention persist."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"To assess whether genetic variants involved in inflammation play a role in the sex difference in depression. Depression is, in part, genetically determined and inflammation has been implicated. Women are twice as likely to develop depression as men.We examined the association, separately in men and women, between seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP) gene and 12 SNPs in the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) gene and depression in 1368 white subjects (30.4% female) referred for cardiovascular evaluation. Depression was defined as a score of >or=10 in the Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Single marker analysis was assessed by the chi(2) test. Haplotype-specific associations were performed, using likelihood ratio tests. Empirical significance levels were determined by permutation tests.Depressed individuals, comprising 14.5% of the total, were more likely to be female, current smokers, have a history of diabetes and myocardial infarction. None of the SNPs in the ALOX5AP gene, either singly or in combination, was associated with depression. The 12 SNPs in the LTA4H gene were not individually associated with depression. However, a six-SNP haplotype in LTA4H gene, named HapE, showed a significant protective effect on depression in women, but not in men, after correcting for cardiovascular effects. The interaction between HapE and sex on depression was statistically significant.This study provides the first evidence for a sex-specific association of a novel haplotype in the LTA4H gene on depression. Although replication is needed, our study suggests that genetic variations may underlie sex differences in depression."mycardial	Review	"This review summarizes some available information on gender differences of myocardial injury with particular attention to experimental approach. It has been observed that significant gender differences exist already in normal heart. They involve among others cardiac growth, contractile function, calcium metabolism and function of mitochondria. Differences, characteristic of the normal myocardium, generate the logical presumption of the different reaction of the male and female heart to various pathogenic factors. Most of the experimental studies confirm the clinical observations: increased resistance of the female heart to ischemia/reperfusion injury was shown in dogs, rats, mice and rabbits. Furthermore, gender differences in the ischemic tolerance of the adult myocardium can be influenced by interventions (e.g. hypoxia) imposed during the early phases of ontogenetic development. The already high tolerance of the adult female heart can be increased by adaptation to chronic hypoxia and ischemic preconditioning. It seems that the protective effect depends on age: it was absent in young, highly tolerant heart but it appeared with the decrease of natural resistance during aging. Both experimental and clinical studies have indicated that female gender influences favorably also the remodeling and the adaptive response to myocardial infarction. It follows from the data available that male and female heart differs significantly in many parameters under both physiological and pathological conditions. Detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms of these differences are still unknown; they involve genomic and non-genomic effects of sex steroid hormones, particularly the most frequently studied estrogens. The cardiovascular system is, however, influenced not only by estrogens but also by other sex hormones, e.g. androgens. Moreover, steroid hormone receptors do not act alone but interact with a broad array of co-regulatory proteins to alter transcription. The differences are so important that they deserve serious consideration in clinical practice in search for proper diagnostic and therapeutic procedures."mycardial	Clinical	"Many studies have compared women and men for symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but findings have been inconsistent, largely because of varying inclusion criteria, different study populations, and different methods.The purpose of this study was to analyze gender differences in symptoms in a well-defined, population-based sample of women and men who experienced a first AMI.Information on symptoms was collected from the medical charts of all patients with a first AMI, aged 25 to 74 years, who had taken part in the INTERGENE (Interplay Between Genetic Susceptibility and Environmental Factors for the Risk of Chronic Diseases) study. INTERGENE was a population-based research program on risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Medical charts were reviewed for each patient to determine the symptoms of AMI, and the prevalence of each symptom was compared according to sex.The study included 225 patients with a first AMI: 52 women and 173 men. Chest pain was the most common symptom, affecting 88.5% (46/52) of the women and 94.8% (164/173) of the men, with no statistically significant difference between the sexes. Women had significantly higher rates of 4 symptoms: nausea (53.8% [28/52] vs 29.5% [51/173]; age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.78; 95% CI, 1.47-5.25), back pain (42.3% [22/52] vs 14.5% [25/173]; OR = 4.29; 95% CI, 2.14-8.62), dizziness (17.3% [9/52] vs 7.5% [13/173]; OR = 2.60; 95% CI, 1.04-6.50), and palpitations (11.5% [6/52] vs 2.9% [5/173]; OR = 3.99; 95% CI, 1.15-13.84). No significant gender differences were found in the proportions of patients experiencing arm or shoulder pain, diaphoresis, dyspnea, fatigue, neck pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, jaw pain, or syncope/lightheadedness. No significant differences were found in the duration, type, or location of chest pain. The medical charts listed numerically more symptoms in women than in men; 73.1% (38/52) of the women but only 48.0% (83/173) of the men reported >3 symptoms (age-adjusted OR = 3.26; 95% CI, 1.62-6.54).Chest pain is the most common presenting symptom in both women and men with AMI. Nausea, back pain, dizziness, and palpitations were significantly more common in women. Women as a group displayed a greater number of symptoms than did men."mycardial	Clinical	"Identifying early warning signs of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may aid in the early diagnosis of coronary artery disease.This study was conducted to assess early warning signs (prodromal symptoms) of AMI, with comparisons made by gender. Another aim was to determine whether these early warning signs had any influence on the patients' acute symptoms of AMI.This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study of Norwegian patients (aged <or=75 years) hospitalized with their first AMI. A self-administered questionnaire was used to gather information on prodromal symptoms, defined as pain in the chest, pain in the shoulder or back, radiating pain or numbness in the arms, dyspnea, and fatigue. Symptoms were reported for the year before AMI and during the acute stage. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between prodromal symptoms and acute symptoms and the effect of medical history (hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia).The self-administered questionnaire had a 72% response rate; the study included 149 women and 384 men diagnosed with first-time AMI. Symptoms occurring during the year before AMI included pain in the chest in 45% (240/533), shoulder or back pain in 51% (270/533), arm pain in 38% (205/533), dyspnea in 33% (176/533), and fatigue in 62% (330/533). There were no statistically significant gender differences. The risk of experiencing chest symptoms in the acute phase was >5 times higher in women who had experienced prodromal symptoms in the chest (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.11; 95% CI, 1.38-18.88) and nearly 3 times higher in men (OR = 2.80; 95% CI, 1.17-6.70). The risk of experiencing shoulder or back pain was almost 5 times higher in men with prodromal shoulder or back pain (OR = 4.96; 95% CI, 3.01-8.19), but no statistically significant association was found in women. The risk of experiencing radiating arm pain or numbness in the acute phase was more than doubled in women with prodromal arm pain (OR = 2.68; 95% CI, 1.19-6.20) and more than tripled in men with prodromal arm pain (OR = 3.11; 95% CI, 1.90-5.07). The risk of experiencing dyspnea in the acute phase was more than doubled in women with prodromal dyspnea (OR = 2.67; 95% CI, 1.25-5.71) and >5 times higher in men with prodromal dyspnea (OR = 5.73; 95% CI, 3.42-9.62). Finally, the risk of fatigue was almost tripled in women (OR = 2.97; 95% CI, 1.28-6.85) and more than doubled in men (OR = 2.51; 95% CI, 1.54-4.11). Hypertensive women, but not men, were less likely to experience chest symptoms in the acute phase (OR = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.82).Almost half of the study patients (45%) experienced prodromal chest symptoms the year before their first AMI. These prodromal symptoms predicted the symptoms that occurred during the acute stage of AMI, with some differences between the sexes."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"The use of synthetic progesterone-like substances in hormone replacement therapy and birth control pills has been associated with increases in cardiovascular morbidity and the prevalence of diabetes.The primary aims of this study were to investigate whether physiologic concentrations of progesterone might also be associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and to explore potential gender differences in these associations in elderly Swedish men and women.This prospective, longitudinal study was performed in a Swedish population-based sample of opposite-sex twins aged between 71 and 80 years who were not receiving sex hormone therapy. Serum concentrations of progesterone, estradiol, C-reactive protein (CRP), and urea were measured at baseline (1996) and at 8-year follow-up (2004), and serum concentrations of cystatin and insulin were measured only at follow-up. The outcomes of interest were cardiovascular morbidity (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, congestive heart failure [CHF], cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, and thromboembolism), diabetes, and mortality throughout the observation period.At baseline, the study sample included 230 men and 195 women (mean [SD] age, 74.6 [2.6] years). At follow-up, 132 men and 145 women (mean age, 82.4 [2.5] years) met the inclusion criteria, of whom 128 men and 112 women did so at both baseline and follow-up. Serum progesterone concentrations, which did not differ significantly from reported concentrations for the age group, were significantly associated with mortality across the observation period (P < 0.001). At follow-up, higher serum progesterone was significantly associated with the occurrence of CHF (P < 0.01); this association remained robust after adjustment for CRP, cystatin, and insulin levels.In these elderly Swedish men and women, increased physiologic concentrations of progesterone were found to be associated with an increased prevalence of CHF, independent of inflammatory factors, markers of renal function, and insulin metabolism."mycardial	Outcomes	"Previous studies have shown that women younger than 55 years have higher hospital mortality rates after acute myocardial infarction (MI) than age-matched men. We examined whether such mortality differences have decreased in recent years.We investigated temporal trends in the hospital case-fatality rates of MI by sex and age from June 1, 1994, through December 31, 2006. The study population included 916,380 patients from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction with a confirmed diagnosis of MI.In-hospital mortality decreased markedly between 1994 and 2006 in all patients but more so in women than men. The mortality reduction in 2006 relative to 1994 was largest in women younger than 55 years (52.9%) and lowest in men younger than 55 years (33.3%). In patients younger than 55 years, the absolute decrease in mortality was 3 times larger in women than men (2.7% vs 0.9%). As a result, the excess mortality in younger women (<55 years) compared with men was less pronounced in 2004-2006 (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.67) than it was in 1994-1995 (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-2.24). The sex difference in mortality decrease was lower in older patients (P = .004 for the interaction among sex, age, and year). Changes in comorbidity and clinical severity features at admission accounted for more than 90% of these mortality trends.In recent years, women, particularly younger ones, experienced larger improvements in hospital mortality after MI than men. The narrowing of the mortality gap between younger women and men is largely attributable to temporal changes in risk profiles."mycardial	Review	"Evolving knowledge regarding sex differences in coronary heart disease is emerging. Given the lower burden of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and preserved systolic function in women, which contrasts with greater rates of myocardial ischemia and near-term mortality compared with men, we propose the term ""ischemic heart disease"" as appropriate for this discussion specific to women rather than CAD or coronary heart disease (CHD). This paradoxical difference, where women have lower rates of anatomical CAD but more symptoms, ischemia, and adverse outcomes, appears linked to abnormal coronary reactivity that includes microvascular dysfunction. Novel risk factors can improve the Framingham risk score, including inflammatory markers and reproductive hormones, as well as noninvasive imaging and functional capacity measurements. Risk for women with obstructive CAD is increased compared with men, yet women are less likely to receive guideline-indicated therapies. In the setting of non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, interventional strategies are equally effective in biomarker-positive women and men, whereas conservative management is indicated for biomarker-negative women. For women with evidence of ischemia but no obstructive CAD, antianginal and anti-ischemic therapies can improve symptoms, endothelial function, and quality of life; however, trials evaluating impact on adverse outcomes are needed. We hypothesize that women experience more adverse outcomes compared with men because obstructive CAD remains the current focus of therapeutic strategies. Continued research is indicated to devise therapeutic regimens to improve symptom burden and reduce risk in women with ischemic heart disease."mycardial	Outcomes	"The aim of this study was to evaluate the gender differences in baseline characteristics, therapy, and outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes in 6 Middle Eastern countries. Over a 6-month period in 2007, 8,169 consecutive patients (74% men, 24% women) presenting with acute coronary syndromes were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter study from 6 adjacent Middle Eastern countries. Women were 9 years older than men and more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Women were more likely to present with unstable angina and more often had atypical presentations of ST elevation myocardial infarction. Compared to men, women were significantly less treated with beta blockers and antiplatelet therapy, whereas reperfusion therapy was nonsignificantly less used in women. In all patients with acute coronary syndromes, women not only ranked higher on Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score but also had increased in-hospital mortality, 1.75 times that of men. This mortality difference persisted after adjusting for all confounders (odds ratios 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8, p <0.01). In conclusion, in addition to presentation with higher risk factors, female gender also independently predicted poorer outcomes in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction."mycardial	Outcomes	"Women with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) who undergo coronary angiography have no obstructive coronary lesions more often than men. Sex-specific characteristics and outcomes of patients without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) have not been described previously.Using data from NSTEMI patients enrolled in CRUSADE from 2001 to 2005, we evaluated differences in clinical features and in-hospital outcomes between men and women with no obstructive CAD.After excluding patients with missing catheterization and sex data (n = 1,494), previous coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention (47,907), catheterization contraindications (n = 6,588), and missing obstructive CAD status (n = 1,565), there were 55,514 patients (68.4%) with NSTE acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who underwent angiography (among women, 62.1% [21,294/34,290], and among men, 73% [34,220/46,875]; P < .001). Among these, a total of 5,538 patients (10.0%) had nonnonobstructive CAD-15.1% (3,221/21,294) of women and 6.8% (2,317/34,220) of men (P < .0001). In patients without obstructive CAD, women were as likely as men to have MI (troponin elevation in 89% vs 87%, P = .37). Women and men were equally likely to have larger troponin elevations (58.9% vs 58.6% with troponin >5x upper limit of normal, P = .69, respectively). In NSTEMI patients without obstructive CAD, in-hospital death (0.6% women vs 0.7% men) and cardiogenic shock (1.0% women vs 0.7% men) were infrequent.Among NSTE ACS patients undergoing coronary angiography, absence of obstructive CAD is more common in women than men. Although nonobstructive CAD was twice as common among women with NSTEMI, sex differences in characteristics and outcomes were similar to those found with obstructive CAD. Unadjusted in-hospital outcomes of NSTEMI patients with nonobstructive CAD are favorable in both sexes. Whether the underlying pathophysiology of NSTE ACS without documentation of obstructive CAD is different between women and men requires further study."mycardial	Management	"There are increasing opportunities for MI patients to attend lay-led, community based generic self-management programmes via self-referral.To determine the effectiveness of the Expert Patient Programme (EPP) for MI patients who had completed CR using a randomised controlled, wait-list design, with a nested qualitative study.The Intervention Group attends the EPP immediately after completing the baseline assessment; The Control Group had the opportunity to attend the EPP after completion of the 4-month follow-up. 192 MI patients (72% men) completed baseline assessment; 162 responded at follow-up. Telephone interviews were conducted with 10 male and 9 female Intervention group participants.Intention-to-treat analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups although a pattern of small improvements among the Intervention Group was observed over time. Interviews revealed that Intervention Group participants viewed CR as being more about instruction whereas the EPP was viewed as being more about discussion, mutual support, and goal setting. A gender difference emerged whereby male participants valued information exchange whereas female participants expressed a preference for emotional support and social interaction within the EPP context.The EPP appears to hold few benefits for MI patients who have attended CR."mycardial	Clinical	"Our aim was to utilize a community-based approach to identify sex-related differences in risk factors for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA).There are significant sex-based differences in prevalence and manifestation of SCA. Any differences related to predictors of SCA in women versus men are likely to have implications for risk stratification and prevention.The Ore-SUDS (Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study) is an ongoing prospective investigation of SCA in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area (population approximately 1 million). All cases meeting criteria for SCA were ascertained using multiple sources. Medical records were reviewed to identify clinical conditions that may contribute to SCA risk, and comparisons were made between male and female SCA cases using Pearson's chi-square tests for categorical variables, t tests for continuous variables, and multivariate logistic regression analysis.During 2002 to 2007, 1,568 adult SCA cases were identified (women 36% vs. men 64%; p < 0.0001) and women were older (mean age 71 +/- 14 years vs. 65 +/- 14 years, p < 0.0001). There were no significant sex differences in prevalence of obesity, dyslipidemia, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, or history of myocardial infarction. In multivariate analysis, women were significantly less likely to have severe LV dysfunction (odds ratio: 0.51; 95% confidence interval: 0.31 to 0.84) or previously recognized coronary artery disease (odds ratio: 0.34; 95% confidence interval: 0.20 to 0.60) compared with men.Women were significantly less likely than men to have a diagnosis of structural heart disease (LV dysfunction or coronary artery disease) before SCA. These findings suggest that fewer women may be eligible for prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement based on current guidelines and therefore may not have equal opportunity for prevention. Enhancement of SCA risk stratification may have even higher importance for women."mycardial	Review	"This study sought to investigate the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel in women and men.Previous analyses have shown sex-based differences in response to several antiplatelet medications. Little is known about the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel in women and men.This study performed a meta-analysis of all blinded randomized clinical trials comparing clopidogrel and placebo (CURE [Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events], CREDO [Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation], CLARITY-TIMI 28 [Clopidogrel as Adjunctive Reperfusion Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 28], COMMIT [Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction Trial], and CHARISMA [Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance] trials), involving a total of 79,613 patients, of whom 30% were women. The relative efficacy and safety of clopidogrel at reducing cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction [MI], or stroke) in women and men was estimated using random-effects modeling.Overall, clopidogrel was associated with a highly significant 14% proportional reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events (odds ratio [OR]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80 to 0.93), with no significant differences in treatment effect between women and men. Among the 23,533 women enrolled, there were fewer cardiovascular events in the clopidogrel group compared with the placebo group (11.0% vs. 11.8%; OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.01). In women the risk reduction with clopidogrel seemed to be greatest for MI (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.93), with the effects on stroke (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.21) or total death (OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.08) not statistically significant. Among the 56,091 men enrolled, there were fewer cardiovascular events in those receiving clopidogrel compared with placebo (7.8% vs. 9.0%; OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.91), and the risk reduction was significant for MI (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.92), stroke (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.96), and total death (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84 to 0.97). Clopidogrel increased the risk of major bleeding in both women (OR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.79) and men (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.42).Clopidogrel reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in both women and men."mycardial	Management	"Cardiac troponins are the most sensitive and specific biomarker for myocardial infarction (MI) diagnosis. If there is a gender bias in MI diagnosis, it could be reduced by more consistently applying objective diagnostic criteria to improve women's outcomes. This study set out to assess the accuracy and correlates of the cardiac troponin I (cTnI) assay in the diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation MI, to determine how the assay accuracy and correlates vary by gender, and to explore the interaction between factors that may influence cTnI accuracy and affect gender differences in diagnosis. The data were obtained from the CHECKMATE study. It included 924 patients with possible myocardial ischemia excluding subjects with ST-segment elevation. The Dade-Behring Stratus CS STAT near-patient instrument (Dade Behring, Inc, Newark, Del) was used to measure cTnI. We assessed baseline troponin accuracy using a standard MI definition. There were 125 subjects with a definite MI diagnosis. Baseline troponin was 44% sensitive and 97% specific in predicting MI, with no significant gender differences. In contrast, other positive cardiac markers, namely rising or falling creatine-kinase MB fraction and positive electrocardiogram, occurred more frequently in men. Sensitivity (SE) of baseline troponin was higher in subjects where baseline troponin was obtained longer than 2 hours after the chest pain onset. The study did not observe a significant difference in the assay SE or specificity by gender. This observation, plus the fact that other positive cardiac markers occurred more frequently in men, suggest the troponin test may help to improve the diagnosis of MI in women."mycardial	Outcomes	"A higher mortality risk for women with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been a common finding in the past, even after acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We set out to analyze whether there are gender differences in real-world contemporary treatment and outcomes of STEMI.A retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients with STEMI and acute coronary angiography with the intention of performing a PCI at our center 6/1999-6/2006 was carried out (n = 566). Data were examined for gender-specific differences regarding patients' characteristics, referral patterns, timing of acute symptoms, angiographic findings, procedural details, and adverse events at 30 days after PCI.Women (n = 161) were on average 8 years older than men (n = 405), had higher co-morbidity, were more often transported to the hospital by ambulance and presented less often to the emergency room on their own (4.2% vs. 12.6% in men, P = 0.02). The pre-hospital delay from symptom onset to admission was significantly longer for women (median 185 vs. 135 min, P < 0.02). There was no gender difference in time from admission to PCI (median 46 min vs. 48 min, P = 0.42). Both genders received PCI with similar frequency (88.8% vs. 92.4%, P = 0.19), with similar success rates (83.2% vs. 85.3%, P = 0.68). Thirty-day overall mortality for women was not significantly higher than for men (8.7% vs. 7.2%, P = 0.6). Re-infarction or stroke within 30 days were rare for both genders without gender-specific differences whereas bleeding necessitating blood replacement was significantly more frequent in women (16.8% vs. 5.9%, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, female gender was not independently associated with a higher risk of 30-day mortality (OR 0.964, P = 0.93).Women underwent PCI therapy for STEMI with the same frequency and the same angiographic success as men. Despite their more advanced age and the higher prevalence of co-morbidities, they did not have a significantly higher 30-day mortality rate than men. Female gender was not an independent risk factor of 30-day mortality. Longer pre-hospital delays before hospital admission in women indicate that awareness of risk from coronary artery disease should be further raised in women."mycardial	Review	"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in most developed countries. Gender-related differences have been found in the presentation, prevalence, and clinical outcomes of CAD in many studies. Compared to women, men present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction more often and have a higher prevalence of CAD. These findings indicate that gender may have an important influence on CAD. Appropriate diagnosis, prevention, recent patent inventions, and treatment will improve the care of all patients. It is therefore necessary to consider the differences in the features of ischemic heart disease between men and women when examining patients. Novel drugs for tailor-made therapy based on gender differences should be developed for the treatment of CAD in future."mycardial	Clinical	"To analyze the association between chronic diseases and health risk behaviors and self-perceived health status by gender.A total of 39.821 adults (30+ years old) who participated in the system VigilÃ¢ncia de Fatores de Risco e ProteÃ§Ã£o para DoenÃ§as CrÃ´nicas por InquÃ©rito TelefÃ´nico (VIGITEL--Telephone-Based Surveillance of Risk and Protective Factors for Chronic Diseases) carried out in 27 Brazilian capitals in 2006 were included in the study. The dependent variable was medical diagnosis reporting of diabetes, hypertension and myocardial infarct or stroke. Respondents were grouped into three categories: no disease; one chronic disease; and two or more. The associations between the dependent variable and sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral risk factors (smoking, consumption of fatty meat and whole milk, leisure-time physical inactivity, low fruit and vegetable intake and intake of added salt) and self-perceived health status were assessed in men and women using multinomial logistic regression.Chronic disease reporting was higher among older men and women with lower schooling, BMI > or = 30 kg/m2 and who were on a diet. There was an inverse association between number of risk behaviors and two or more chronic diseases (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54;0.76 among men and OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77;0.97 among women). Those men (OR: 33.61; 95% CI: 15.70;71.93) and women (OR: 13.02; 95% CI: 6.86; 24.73) who self-perceived their health as poor reported more chronic diseases. There was no statistical interaction between self-perceived health status and gender.An inverse association between number of risk behaviors and reporting of two or more chronic diseases suggests a reverse causality and/or higher survival rates among those who take better care of themselves. Men seem to have poorer perception of their health status compared to women, after adjustment for confounders."mycardial	Management	"Studies from several countries have documented gender disparities in the management of coronary artery disease. Whether such gender disparities are seen in Italy and, if so, whether they can be explained by factors such as age and severity of illness were investigated.77 974 Piedmontese patients, admitted between 1999 and 2002, with a primary diagnosis of myocardial infarction (ICD 410), angina (ICD 413), chronic ischaemia (ICD 414) and chest pain (ICD 786.5) were studied. The number of men and women undergoing surgical treatment was extracted and the male-female odds ratios calculated. Several risk factors and a risk adjustment technique (APR-DRG) were used to control for possible confounders. Backward stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for significant covariates.Crude analysis demonstrated that gender is a discriminating factor in the probability of surgery (OR 2.11, 95% CI 2.04 to 2.19), with similar findings among those with each main diagnosis. The odds ratios decreased after adjustment for age, co-morbidity and disease severity but remained significant.Men and women admitted to hospitals in a region of northern Italy with a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease are treated differently and this cannot be explained by age or severity of disease."mycardial	Outcomes	"Younger, but not older, women have a higher mortality than men of similar age after a myocardial infarction (MI). We sought to determine whether this relationship is true for both ST elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI).Retrospective cohort study.1057 USA hospitals participant in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction between 2000 and 2006.126 172 STEMI and 235 257 NSTEMI patients.Hospital death.For both STEMI and NSTEMI, the younger the patient's age, the greater the excess mortality risk for women compared with men, while older women fared similarly (STEMI) or better (NSTEMI) than men (p<0.0001 for the age-sex interaction). In STEMI, the unadjusted women-to-men RR was 1.68 (95% CI 1.41 to 2.01), 1.78 (1.59 to 1.99), 1.45 (1.34 to 1.57), 1.08 (1.02 to 1.14) and 1.03 (0.98 to 1.07) for age <50 years, age 50-59, age 60-69, age 70-79 and age 80-89, respectively. For NSTEMI, corresponding unadjusted RRs were 1.56 (1.31 to 1.85), 1.42 (1.27 to 1.58), 1.17 (1.09 to 1.25), 0.92 (0.88 to 0.96) and 0.86 (0.83 to 0.89). After adjusting for risk status, the excess risk for younger women compared with men decreased to approximately 15-20%, while a better survival of older NSTEMI women compared with men persisted.Sex-related differences in short-term mortality are age-dependent in both STEMI and NSTEMI patients."mycardial	Outcomes	"To examine the impact of diabetes, gender and their interaction on 30-day, 1-year and 5-year post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality in three age groups (20-64, 65-74 and > or = 75 years).Retrospective analysis including 23 700 patients aged > or = 20 years (22% with diabetes) admitted to hospital for a first AMI in any hospital in the Province of Quebec, Canada, between April 1995 and March 1997. Administrative databases were used to identify patients and assess outcomes.Regarding 30-day mortality, there was non-significant interaction between diabetes and gender. Women aged < 75 years had, independently of diabetes status, at least a 38% (P < 0.05) higher mortality than their male counterparts after adjustment for socio-economic status and co-morbid conditions. Gender difference disappeared, however, after controlling for in-hospital complications. Regarding 1-year mortality (31-365 days), there was no significant gender disparity for all age groups. During the 5-year follow-up, no gender differences were seen in any age group, except for younger (< 65 years) women with diabetes, who had a 52% (P = 0.004) higher mortality than men after controlling for co-variables. This female disadvantage was demonstrated by a significant interaction between diabetes and gender in patients aged < 65 years (P = 0.009).The higher 30-day mortality post-AMI in younger (20-64 years) and middle-aged (65-74 years) women compared with men was not influenced by diabetes status. However, during the 5-year follow-up, the similar gender mortality observed in patients without diabetes seemed to disappear in younger patients with diabetes, which may be explained by the deleterious, long-term, post-AMI impact of diabetes in younger women."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"To determine whether the magnitude of post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) sympathetic activation is greater in women (F-AMI) than men (M-AMI).Both sympatho-humoral activation and female gender are associated with worse outcome in the early phase following AMI. However, women have lower sympathetic output than men. We therefore examined matched groups of F-AMI (18) and M-AMI (18) patients 2-4 days following uncomplicated AMI, then 3 monthly to 9 months; matched normal control (NC) groups comprised M-NC (18) and F-NC (18). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was measured by microneurography. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was lower in the F-NC than M-NC (at least P < 0.05) and greater in the two AMI groups than their corresponding NC groups (at least P < 0.001). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was similar in the F-AMI and M-AMI groups indicating a post-AMI increase in women of about twice that in men (P < 0.0001). Both AMI groups returned to corresponding NC (lower in women) levels by 9 months.Following uncomplicated AMI, women developed a relatively greater magnitude of sympathetic activation lasting until its resolution at 9 months. This is consistent with reports of their worse prognosis observed during this time period, with important potential clinical implications."mycardial	Management	"Although nurses frequently determine patient priority and urgency status for emergency evaluation and treatment of symptoms suggestive of myocardial infarction (MI), surprisingly few studies have specifically examined the cardiac triage decisions of emergency department (ED) nurses. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explicate the decision-making processes of ED nurses who triage men and women for MI.A qualitative, descriptive study was conducted using focus group methodology. A synthesized conceptual model was used to guide focus group discussions and to begin the process of developing a conceptually based, quantifiable measure of ED nurses' cardiac triage decisions. Participants' (N = 12) oral descriptions were audiotape recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the Krueger content analysis method.When making MI triage decisions and determining triage urgency status, ED nurses determine the underlying cause of patients' chief complaints based on clinical presentation, patient demographics, past medical history, as well as their own attitudes, perceptions and beliefs, nursing knowledge, and ED experience. Important patient cues include general appearance, vital signs, cardiac history, chest pain, and mode of transportation. Nurse's ultimate goal when making cardiac triage decisions is to have the patient receive a prompt electrocardiogram and prompt medical evaluation and to advocate for the patient.Nurses are knowledgeable of age and sex differences in MI presentation. However, some nurses hold cultural biases and stereotypes that may interfere with the timely delivery of emergency cardiac healthcare. Findings from this study will be used to develop a quantifiable measure of ED nurses' cardiac triage decision-making processes."mycardial	Management	"Although prior studies have demonstrated disparities in the management and outcomes of women with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), there are limited large-scale contemporary data on gender differences in post-intervention outcomes in this population.We analyzed patients according to 2 ACS categories, unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who had a percutaneous coronary intervention in the ACC-NCDR from January 1, 2004, to March 30, 2006. Of 199,690 patients, 55,691 women presented with UA/NSTEMI, and 12,335 women presented with STEMI. Clinical and angiographic characteristics, procedural and treatment patterns, and in-hospital outcomes were examined.Women presented more often with UA/NSTEMI than men (82% of women vs 77% of men, P < .0001). Despite having greater comorbidities, women in both ACS categories had fewer high risk angiographic features than men. Women were less likely to receive aspirin or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and were less often discharged on aspirin or statin. For in-hospital mortality, the adjusted odds ratio for men compared to women was similar (odds ratio 0.97, P = .5). Women had higher rates of cardiogenic shock, congestive heart failure, any bleeding, and any vascular complications. Importantly, rates of subacute stent thrombosis were less in women compared to men (0.43% vs 0.57%, P = .0003).Although women had fewer high-risk angiographic features than men, they continue to have higher rates of in-hospital complications. This suggests the need for gender-tailored techniques to minimize post-intervention complications and maximize application of evidence-based antiplatelet therapies."mycardial	Outcomes	"Women have an unexplained worse outcome after myocardial infarction (MI) compared with men in many studies. Depressive symptoms predict adverse post-MI outcomes and are more prevalent among women than men. We examined whether depressive symptoms contribute to women's worse outcomes after MI.In a prospective multicenter study (PREMIER), 2411 (807 women) MI patients were enrolled. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire. Outcomes included 1-year rehospitalization, presence of angina using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, and 2-year mortality. Multivariable analyses were used to evaluate the association between sex and these outcomes, adjusting for clinical characteristics. The depressive symptoms score was added to the models to evaluate whether it attenuated the association between sex and outcomes. Depressive symptoms were more prevalent in women compared with men (29% versus 18.8%, P<0.001). After adjusting for demographic factors, comorbidities, and MI severity, women had a mildly higher risk of rehospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.40), angina (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.75), and mortality (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.64). After adding depressive symptoms to the multivariable models, the relationship further declined toward the null, particularly for rehospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.34) and angina (odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.63), whereas there was little change in the estimate for mortality (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.62). Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with each of the study outcomes with a similar magnitude of effect in both women and men.A higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in women modestly contributes to their higher rates of rehospitalization and angina compared with men but not mortality after MI. Our results support the recent recommendations of improving recognition of depressive symptoms after MI."mycardial	Outcomes	"The aim of the current study was to compare the short and mid-term outcome between males and females treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent implantation or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and drug-eluting stent implantation in the Arterial Revascularisation Therapies Study I and II (ARTS I and II).The patients included in ARTS I were randomised to PCI with bare metal stents or to CABG. The patients enrolled in ARTS II were treated with Cypher stent implantation. All patients were scheduled for clinical follow-up at one, six and twelve months, and after three and five years. Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) included death, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), myocardial infarction (MI), repeat target vessel PCI (RPCI) and CABG. At one and three-year follow-up in ARTS II, both the female and male patients had an incidence of MACCE similar to ARTS I-CABG. When comparing the female and male population of ARTS II, there were no differences between the two genders in terms of in-hospital outcome. At one year and three years there were no gender specific differences in the incidence of MACCE.Female and male patients in ARTS II had significantly lower MACCE rates compared with ARTS I-PCI, but similar to that of ARTS I-CABG. In ARTS II, MACCE free survival was similar for the two genders at three years follow-up."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Functional improvement after acute myocardial ischaemia (MI) has been achieved by transplantation of different adult stem and progenitor cell types. It is controversial whether these cell types are able to form novel functional myocardium. Alternatively, graft-related or immune-related paracrine mechanisms may preserve existing myocardium, improve neovascularisation, affect tissue remodelling or induce endogenous de novo formation of functional myocardium. We have applied an alternative somatic cell type, human cord-blood-derived unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs) in a porcine model of acute MI.USSCs were transplanted into the acutely ischaemic lateral wall of the left ventricle (LV). LV dimension and function were assessed by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) pre-MI, immediately post-MI, 48 hours and 8 weeks after USSC injection. Additionally, apoptosis, mitosis and recruitment of macrophages were examined 48 hours post-engraftment.Gender-specific and species-specific FISH/immunostaining failed to detect engrafted donor cells 8 weeks post-MI. Nevertheless, cell treatment effectively preserved natural myocardial architecture. Global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before MI was 60% (7%). Post-MI, LVEF decreased to 34% (8%). After 8 weeks, LVEF had further decreased to 27% (6%) in the control group and recovered to 52% (2%) in the USSC group (p<0.01). Left-ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) before MI was 28 (2) ml. 8 weeks post-MI, LVEDV had increased to 77 (4) ml in the control group. No LV dilation was detected in the USSC group (LVEDV: 26 (2) ml, p<0.01). Neither apoptosis nor recruitment of macrophages and mitosis were different in either groups.Transplantation of USSCs significantly improved LV function and prevented scar formation as well as LV dilation. Since differentiation, apoptosis and macrophage mobilisation at infarct site were excluded as underlying mechanisms, paracrine effects are most likely to account for the observed effects of USSC treatment."mycardial	CLIN	mycardial	Clinical	"To analyse the prognostic factors of ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction men and women.The data of 904 in-hospital patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were collected from the database of our hospital during 2003 - 2004 and 728 of them were followed-up. The patients were divided into groups of male and female.Women had more accompanying diseases such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension than men; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was lower in female. The rate of successful reperfusion was lower in women than men (P < 0.05). Mortality rate was higher in women. 728 (202 female) patients were followed up. The use of beta-blockers were statistically different between two groups during follow-up. In the female group, LVEF was lower significantly and the rate of readmission for heart failure and myocardial infarction as well as that of mortality was higher (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that sex difference was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.130, 95% CI 0.954 - 4.754, P = 0.045), but not for mortality in the followed-up period and readmission.There are many factors leading to the poor prognosis of ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction in women. It is essential to pay more attention to its clinical characteristics and begin intervention of the risk factors earlier so as to improve the prognosis."mycardial	Outcomes	"There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the role of sex on the in-hospital mortality of patients with acute myocardial infarction. The objective of this study is to determine whether there are gender differences in in-hospital mortality and angiographic findings of patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We conducted a prospective study of all patients admitted to University Hospital Center Split, Croatia with STEMI from 2004 to 2008 who underwent PCI. From March 2004 throughout September 2008, 488 patients with STEMI underwent PCI (364 men, 74.6%; 124 women, 25.4%). Compared with men, women were significantly older (mean age, 67.3 vs. 60.3 years; p < 0.001). Men had a significantly higher proportion of circumflex artery occlusion (19.5% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.022). A higher proportion of men had a multivessel disease than women (56.8% vs. 41.9%; p = 0.004). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among women (11.3% vs. 4.6%; p = 0.002) but after adjustment for the baseline difference in age, the female sex was not an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.82-1.84). In men, occlusions of left anterior descending artery showed higher mortality rate than occlusions of other coronary arteries (LM 0%, LAD 7.3%, Cx 2.8%, RCA 0.7%, p = 0.03). According to our results female gender is not an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention. In men, occlusions of left anterior descending arteries are associated with higher mortality rate comparing to occlusions of other coronary arteries."mycardial	Outcomes	"The aim of our analysis is to assess gender differences in baseline characteristics, acute therapies, and clinical outcome in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock.The Maximal Individual Therapy of Acute Myocardial Infarction PLUS registry (MITRA PLUS) is a German prospective, multicenter, observational data pool of current treatment of STEMI.STEMI was more often (P < 0.0001) complicated by cardiogenic shock in female patients (12.9%) when compared to male patients (9.3%). This was still true after adjusting for confounding variables (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09-1.30). Women with STEMI admitted in a cardiogenic shock were older (P < 0.0001) and had more often concomitant diseases (P < 0.0001). There was no differences in rates of reperfusion therapy (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77-1.09). Hospital mortality was 67.7% in female patients, when compared to 57.2% in male patients (P < 0.0001). After adjusting for confounding variables in the multivariate analysis hospital mortality did not differ between men and women (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.98-1.38). Early reperfusion therapy was associated with a significant reduction of hospital mortality in female patients with STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.90) with primary PCI being more effective than thrombolytic therapy (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31-0.68).In women, STEMI was more often complicated by cardiogenic shock when compared to men. However, the use of early reperfusion therapy did not differ between the sexes. Primary PCI was associated with the best outcome in female patients with STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock and is therefore the therapy of choice."mycardial	Outcomes	"Conflicting information exists about whether sex differences modulate short-term mortality following acute coronary syndromes (ACS).To investigate the relationship between sex and 30-day mortality in ACS, and to determine whether this relationship was modified by clinical syndrome or coronary anatomy using a large database across the spectrum of ACS and adjusting for potentially confounding clinical covariates.A convenience sample of patients pooled from 11 independent, international, randomized ACS clinical trials between 1993 and 2006 whose databases are maintained at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, North Carolina. Of 136 247 patients, 38 048 (28%) were women; 102 004 (26% women) with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 14 466 (29% women) with non-STEMI (NSTEMI), and 19 777 (40% women) with unstable angina.Thirty-day mortality following ACS.Thirty-day mortality was 9.6% in women and 5.3% in men (odds ratio [OR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-2.00). After multivariable adjustment, mortality was not significantly different between women and men (adjusted OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.15). A significant sex by type of ACS interaction was demonstrated (P < .001). In STEMI, 30-day mortality was higher among women (adjusted OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.24), whereas in NSTEMI (adjusted OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95) and unstable angina, mortality was lower among women (adjusted OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.43-0.70). In a cohort of 35 128 patients with angiographic data, women more often had nonobstructive (15% vs 8%) and less often had 2-vessel (25% vs 28%) and 3-vessel (23% vs 26%) coronary disease, regardless of ACS type. After additional adjustment for angiographic disease severity, 30-day mortality among women was not significantly different than men, regardless of ACS type. The relationship between sex and 30-day mortality was similar across the levels of angiographic disease severity (P for interaction = .70).Sex-based differences existed in 30-day mortality among patients with ACS and vary depending on clinical presentation. However, these differences appear to be largely explained by clinical differences at presentation and severity of angiographically documented disease."mycardial	Clinical	"The purpose of this secondary analysis was to compare gender differences in retrospective reports of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) symptoms resulting from two different assessment methods: the open-ended inquiry and the combined assessment approach. Women reported more atypical symptoms in their responses to the open-ended inquiry and a greater number of typical, atypical, and total symptoms in the combined assessment approach in which the open-ended inquiry was followed by a series of closed-ended questions. Women reported more jaw/neck pain, dyspnea, and palpitations in response to the open-ended inquiry. In the combined assessment, men reported more chest pain/discomfort than women, whereas women were more likely to report jaw/neck pain, dyspnea, back pain, fatigue, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and palpitations. The data suggest that careful attention to the type of questions used to assess AMI symptoms could lead to more definitive conclusions regarding gender differences in AMI symptoms."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Complex diseases often aggregate within families and using the history of family members' disease can potentially increase the accuracy of the risk assessment and allow clinicians to better target on high risk individuals. However, available family risk scores do not reflect the age of disease onset, gender and family structures simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for a family risk score, the stratified log-rank family score (SLFS), which incorporates the age of disease onset of family members, gender differences and the relationship among family members. Via simulation, we demonstrate that the new SLFS is more closely associated with the true family risk for the disease and more robust to family sizes than two existing methods. We apply our proposed method and the two existing methods to a study of stroke and heart disease. The results show that assessing family history can improve the prediction of disease risks and the SLFS has strongest positive associations with both myocardial infarction and stroke."mycardial	Clinical	"It has been debated whether smoking increases the risk of heart disease relatively more in women than in men. It is not known whether there are sex differences with regard to how many years prematurely smoking causes acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to occur. We aimed to determine how smoking affects the age of onset of first myocardial infarction in both the sexes.Clinical data were consecutively entered into a database and were analysed with a multivariate regression technique.In the years 1998-2005, data on 1784 consecutive patients (38.3% women) who were discharged from or died in a district general hospital with a diagnosis of first myocardial infarction were included in the study. Age at first AMI was analysed.Unadjusted mean ages were 76.2 years for women and 69.8 years for men, a difference of 6.4 years (P<0.001). Mean age within the various groups was: women nonsmokers 80.7 years, women smokers 66.2 years, difference 14.4 years (P<0.001); men nonsmokers 72.2 years, men smokers 63.9 years, difference 8.3 years (P<0.001). After adjustment for risk factors (hypertension, cholesterol levels, diabetes) and patient characteristics (history of angina, history of stroke) 13.7 years of the age difference in women were attributed to smoking; the corresponding figure in men was 6.2 years (P<0.001).First AMI occurred significantly more prematurely in women than in men smokers, implying that twice as many years were lost by women as by men smokers."mycardial	Review	"This article reviews gender-specific differences in platelet function and response to aspirin. In contrast with men, women under 65 years of age do not benefit from aspirin therapy in primary prevention of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the overall mortality after myocardial infarction is higher among women, which cannot simply be explained by age or individual treatment. Platelets play a central role in thrombo-ischemic events leading to myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Gender differences in platelet reactivity and ""aspirin resistance"" have been reported. Several studies using female platelets have shown increased platelet reactivity at baseline and a less effective inhibition of platelet aggregation by aspirin. The mechanisms underlying these differences are still to be elucidated, but influences of female sex hormones may play an important role. As a consequence, inhibition of platelet aggregation in women treated with aspirin may be insufficient, and female patients might benefit from higher maintenance dosages or the use of alternative antiplatelet medications. A potential future role of pharmacogenomics and laboratory monitoring of antiplatelet medications in predicting individual responsiveness is likely. Overall, primary prevention of myocardial infarction in women should be correlated with the individual risk score of the female patient. More studies focused on women are needed to optimize gender-specific therapy and, therefore, to improve clinical outcomes in women with atherosclerosis."mycardial	Review	"In this article, we review the impact of gender on the pathophysiology, management and outcomes after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We searched the English-language literature indexed in MEDLINE, Scopus and EBSCOhost Research databases from 1988 through January 2009 using the indexing terms 'gender', 'short- and long-term outcomes' and 'acute coronary syndrome' and 'myocardial infarction'. Data comparing gender differences in outcomes after ACS showed that females have a higher mortality rate than males. Observational studies showed that guideline-recommended management strategies are used significantly less frequently in females than males. The undertreatment and worse outcome of female patients with ACS are probably multifactorial and have been reported in different ethnicities and cultures. However, there are conflicting data regarding to the impact of gender on early versus long-term outcomes, the benefit of early intervention in low- and high-risk females and the influence of unmeasured selection biases in the use of therapies in the observational data. These gender discrepancy trends warrant close follow-up, as this might reflect changes in primary and secondary prevention in the community. Furthermore, gender discrepancy gives an indication of healthcare quality and whether care is given in an unbiased manner. All high-risk females, and males with ACS, should receive optimal medical management, coronary angiography and revascularization whenever indicated."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Cardiac troponins are the markers of choice for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The objective of this study was to compare the frequency of ""aborted myocardial infarction"" (no detectable myocardial injury) determined by measurement of troponin versus that determined by creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-muscle brain (CK-MB) measurement criteria among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who received reperfusion therapy.Since 2004, the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) has had a standard reperfusion protocol for the treatment of patients with STEMI. During the study period, 767 patients presented with new or presumed new ST elevation or left bundle block.The diagnosis of STEMI was confirmed in 765 (99.7%) patients. Using the 99th percentile cutoff value, troponin T elevations occurred in 765 (100%) of 765 patients when serial samples were available. Creatine kinase-MB levels of twice or more the upper limit of normal occurred in 681 (90.1%) of 749 patients with serial samples for CK-MB, and CK equal or greater than twice the gender-specific upper limits of normal occurred in 521 (78.8%) of 661 patients with serial samples for CK available.The frequency of aborted myocardial infarction is 0% when using troponin at the 99th percentile cutoff as recommended by contemporary guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (Nice, France) and American College of Cardiology (Washington, DC)."mycardial	Outcomes	"Women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) previously received less invasive evaluation and experienced higher mortality than men. After improvements in AMI care it is unclear whether gender differences still exist in management and outcome of AMI.All patients admitted to UllevÃ¥l University Hospital for AMI during 2006 and 2007 were included in this cohort study. Predefined data were recorded during the hospital stay, and the survival status of the patients was ascertained on June 30, 2008.A total of 931 women and 2,174 men were included. No gender differences were observed in treatment delay or age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of invasive evaluation in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), women were less likely than men to undergo coronary angiography (adjusted OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.99, p = 0.044) and percutaneous coronary intervention (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47-0.76, p = 0.0001). Age-adjusted in-hospital mortality and long-term survival were similar between men and women.Women with STEMI experienced similar treatment delays and odds of invasive evaluation as men. However, gender differences in invasive evaluation were still observed in NSTEMI patients. No sex differences were observed in age-adjusted early and long-term mortality."mycardial	Clinical	"To identify predictors of decision delay time for health care seeking among Jordanians with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).The study was a cross-sectional descriptive survey. A convenience sample of Jordanians with AMI were interviewed at the coronary care units of two teaching hospitals in Jordan.The Arabic version of the modified Response to Symptom Questionnaire was used to assess predictors of decision delay and patterns of health care-seeking behaviors. Decision delay was evaluated by assisting patients to triangulate time of symptom onset and time of decision to seek professional health care by placing both times in context of daily activities that participants could easily remember. Regression analysis was conducted to elicit predictors of decision delay.Decision delay time among Jordanian men (n=110) and women (n=24) with AMI was alarmingly long (medians 3.5 and 3.6 hours, respectively). Variables that correspondingly predicted decision delay among men and women were age, waiting for symptoms to go away, anxiety due to symptom presentation, and others' responses to patients' symptoms. While 16 other variables (cognitive, emotional, and clinical) independently predicted delay among men, equivalent evidence was not established among women due to the relatively small sample size.Similarities and differences existed between Jordanian men's and women's decision delay to seek health care for AMI. Decision delay time among Jordanians with AMI requires intervention that incorporates awareness of delay predictors. Future research needs to utilize adequate sample sizes of both sexes to obtain a better understanding of sex differences.To reduce decision delay among Jordanians, health educators should emphasize early symptom recognition and the value of prompt health care-seeking behaviors."mycardial	Outcomes	"To ascertain the risk of acute myocardial infarction, invasive cardiac procedures, and mortality among patients with newly diagnosed angina over five years.Incident cohort study of patients with primary care data linked to secondary care and mortality data.40 primary care practices in Scotland.1785 patients with a diagnosis of angina as their first manifestation of ischaemic heart disease, 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2001.Adjusted hazard ratios for acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, death from ischaemic heart disease, and all cause mortality, adjusted for demographics, lifestyle risk factors, and comorbidity at cohort entry.Mean age was 62.3 (SD 11.3). Male sex was associated with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 2.01, 95% confidence interval 1.35 to 2.97), death from ischaemic heart disease (2.80, 1.73 to 4.53), and all cause mortality (1.82, 1.33 to 2.49). Increasing age was associated with acute myocardial infarction (1.04, 1.02 to 1.06, per year of age increase), death from ischaemic heart disease (1.09, 1.06 to 1.11, per year of age increase), and all cause mortality (1.09, 1.07 to 1.11, per year of age increase). Smoking was associated with subsequent acute myocardial infarction (1.94, 1.31 to 2.89), death from ischaemic heart disease (2.12, 1.32 to 3.39), and all cause mortality (2.11, 1.52 to 2.95). Obesity was associated with death from ischaemic heart disease (2.01, 1.17 to 3.45) and all cause mortality (2.20, 1.52 to 3.19). Previous stroke was associated with all cause mortality (1.78, 1.13 to 2.80) and chronic kidney disease with death from ischaemic heart disease (5.72, 1.74 to 18.79). Men were more likely than women to have coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty after a diagnosis of angina; older people were less likely to receive percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Acute myocardial infarction after a diagnosis of angina was associated with an increased risk of death from ischaemic heart disease and all cause mortality (8.84 (5.31 to 14.71) and 4.23 (2.78 to 6.43), respectively). Neither of the invasive cardiac procedures significantly reduced the subsequent risk of all cause mortality.In this sample of people with incident angina from primary care, there were sex differences in survival and age and sex differences in the provision of revascularisation after a diagnosis. Acute myocardial infarction after a diagnosis of angina was strongly predictive of mortality. To minimise adverse outcomes, optimal preventive treatments should be used in patients with angina."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"We have previously shown that populations of skeletal muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) exhibit sex-based differences for skeletal muscle and bone repair, with female cells demonstrating superior engrafting abilities to males in skeletal muscle while male cells differentiating more robustly toward the osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the therapeutic capacity of MDSCs transplanted into myocardium is influenced by sex of donor MDSCs or recipient. Male and female MDSCs isolated from the skeletal muscle of 3-week-old mice were transplanted into recipient male or female dystrophin-deficient (mdx) hearts or into the hearts of male SCID mice following acute myocardial infarction. In the mdx model, no difference was seen in engraftment or blood vessel formation based on donor cell or recipient sex. In the infarction model, MDSC-transplanted hearts showed higher postinfarction angiogenesis, less myocardial scar formation, and improved cardiac function compared to vehicle controls. However, sex of donor MDSCs had no significant effects on engraftment, angiogenesis, and cardiac function. VEGF expression, a potent angiogenic factor, was similar between male and female MDSCs. Our results suggest that donor MDSC or recipient sex has no significant effect on the efficiency of MDSC-triggered myocardial engraftment or regeneration following cardiac injury. The ability of the MDSCs to improve cardiac regeneration and repair through promotion of angiogenesis without differentiation into the cardiac lineage may have contributed to the lack of sex difference observed in these models."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Over the last decade, C-reactive protein concentration analyzed by the high sensitivity method (hsCRP) has been proven as a marker of premature atherosclerosis. Concentration exceeding 2 mg/l represents an increased individual risk of myocardial infarction and stroke but strict application of this borderline is complicated by relations of CRP concentrations to other risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. In a large 1 % representative sample of the Czech population, a positive relation of hsCRP to BMI, a waist circumference and triglyceride concentration was documented. Substantial sex differences were found in its relationship to age. Whereas it is continuously increasing in men, this increase appears in women only after menopause. A substantial decrease of body weight and visceral fat volume by increased physical activity is accompanied by significant decrease of hsCRP in young obese women. This decrease was not related to a change of interleukin-6 concentration, although it is supposed to regulate CRP production. CRP concentration is partly under genetic control as a higher concentration in young siblings of probands with proved coronary atherosclerosis was documented. The participation of genes related to lipoprotein metabolism (genes for apolipoprotein CI and apolipoprotein E) influence hsCRP concentrations. We hypothesized that an increased concentration of hsCRP represents a certain marker of proinflammatory status related to central obesity and triglyceride metabolism and it might be related to individual properties of monocytes in atherogenesis."mycardial	Epidemiology	"In Spain, more than 85% of coronary heart disease deaths occur in adults older than 65 years. However, coronary heart disease incidence and mortality in the Spanish elderly have been poorly described. The aim of this study is to estimate the ten-year incidence and mortality rates of myocardial infarction in a population-based large cohort of Spanish elders.A population-based cohort of 3729 people older than 64 years old, free of previous myocardial infarction, was established in 1995 in three geographical areas of Spain. Any case of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction was investigated until December 2004 using the ""cold pursuit method"", previously used and validated by the the WHO-MONICA project.Men showed a significantly (p < 0.001) higher cumulative incidence of myocardial infarction (7.2%; 95%CI: 5.94-8.54) than women (3.8%; 95%CI: 3.06-4.74). Although cumulative incidence increased with age (p < 0.05), gender-differences tended to narrow. Adjusted incidence rates were higher in men (957 per 100 000 person-years) than in women (546 per 100 000 person-years) (p < 0.001) and increased with age (p < 0.001). The increase was progressive in women but not in men. Adjusted mortality rates were also higher in men than in women (p < 0.001), being three times higher in the age group of > or = 85 years old than in the age group of 65-74 years old (p < 0.001).Incidence of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction is high in the Spanish elderly population. Men show higher rates than women, but gender differences diminish with age."mycardial	Outcomes	"The role of sex differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after myocardial infarction (MI) remains controversial.In total 408 Norwegian patients completed the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire 2.5 years after MI. We compared HRQoL between sexes and with national norms. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the association of scores on the Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS) component summary scales with clinical and sociodemographic variables.Women scored lower than norms on the Physical functioning, Role functioning-physical, General health, and Role functioning-emotional scales. Men scored higher on Bodily pain, and lower on the other 7 scales compared to norms. Women <70 years scored lower than men on 3 out of 8 scales and on PCS. Women >/=70 scored lower than men on 5 out of 8 scales and on PCS. Relative to sex- and age-specific norms, there were no sex-differences in SF-36 scores. Age, time since the index MI, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), previous MI, and stroke predicted PCS scores in women. Education, COPD, infarct localization, number of indications for cardiovascular medication at discharge, medication for heart failure, and subsequent MI predicted PCS scores in men. Smoking status, education, and Q-wave MI were determinants for MCS scores in men.Patients had impaired HRQoL compared to sex- and age-specific norms 2.5 years after MI. Women had lower HRQoL scores than men, but relative to norms HRQoL was equally affected in both sexes. Men and women had different determinants of HRQoL."mycardial	Management	"The first on-line prospective, open and observational registration, Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry (KAMIR), has been carried out throughout 41 primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) centers by the support of the Korean Circulation Society (KCS) in the memorandum of the 50th Anniversary of the KCS.Between Nov 2005 and Aug 2006, 5624 enrolled patients (3925 male, 1699 female; age=64.0+/-13.0 years) were analyzed. The treatment strategy of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was analyzed according to the sex differences in the field of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).In the initial selection of treatment strategy, invasive treatment was more commonly performed in males than females with both STEMI and NSTEMI (82.0% vs. 78.7%, p=0.001; 50.4% vs. 43.7%, p=0.004). Severe heart failure was the most important predictor of invasive treatment after multivariate adjustment. During hospital stay, PCI regardless of its subtype was more frequently performed in males than in females with both STEMI and NSTEMI (STEMI: 89.5% vs. 84.7%, p<0.001; NSTEMI: 77.0% vs. 66.7%, p<0.001). Success rate of PCI in STEMI was not different between the sexes (95.8% vs. 93.8%, p=0.075), but that of NSTEMI was higher in males than females (96.8% vs. 95.6%, p=0.005). Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) developed more frequently in women than men with both STEMI (9.2% vs. 17.0%, p<0.001) and NSTEMI (7.3% vs. 12.0%, p<0.001) during 1 month clinical follow-up.In the initial treatment of AMI in Korea, there is no gender difference for invasive treatment. However, success rate of PCI in NSTEMI was lower and 1 month MACE was higher in females than males in Korea."mycardial	Clinical	"Assessment of left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony after myocardial infarction has prognostic value. There were no reference ranges for 2-dimensional (2D) speckle tracking synchrony, and it was unclear whether color tissue Doppler imaging and 2D speckle tracking synchrony indexes were comparable. One hundred twenty-two healthy volunteers and 40 patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) had LV systolic and diastolic synchrony, defined as the SD of time to peak systolic (2D-SDTs) and early diastolic (2D-SDTe) velocities in the 12 basal and mid segments using 2D speckle tracking, respectively. Mean 2D-SDTs and 2D-SDTe were 29.4 +/- 16.1 and 14.2 +/- 6.1 ms in healthy subjects, respectively. Gender and mean 2D systolic velocity independently predicted 2D-SDTs, and mean 2D early diastolic velocity independently predicted 2D-SDTe. Bland-Altman analysis showed suboptimal agreement between 2D speckle tracking and tissue Doppler imaging dyssynchrony indexes. 2D speckle tracking showed lower coefficients of variation for time to peak systolic and early diastolic velocities than tissue Doppler imaging. There were no significant differences in coefficients of variation for 2D speckle tracking systolic and diastolic synchrony for high versus low frame rates. Patients with NSTEMI had significantly lower ejection fraction, but higher LV mass and wall stress than healthy subjects. Only 2D-SDTs was significantly higher in patients with NSTEMI compared with healthy subjects (37.1 +/- 22.5 vs 29.4 +/- 16.1 ms; p = 0.02). In conclusion, 2D-SDTs was gender specific and influenced by global systolic function, and 2D-SDTe was influenced by global diastolic function. 2D speckle tracking and tissue Doppler imaging dyssynchrony indexes were not comparable. 2D speckle tracking may be a more sensitive discriminator of LV systolic dyssynchrony than tissue Doppler imaging."mycardial	Review	"Women and men differ in drug needs and drug metabolism. Usually women are smaller and lighter and have a higher body fat percentage and lower kidney function. Primary drug-metabolizing enzymes in the intestinal wall and liver, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family, have different activities in men and women. Their substrates (beta-blockers, blockers of calcium channels such as nifedipine and verapamil, cyclosporine, and many others) are metabolized differently. Sex differences were observed after administration of digitalis, which is often overdosed in women. Furthermore, beta-blockers are found at higher plasma levels in women and ACE inhibitors cause more side effects in women than in men. In women, acetylsalicylic acid provides effective primary prophylaxis against stroke but not myocardial infarction. In men, these drugs have opposite effects. Anticoagulants and thrombolytics often lead to bleeding complications in women, QT prolonging drugs produce more frequently arrhythmia. It is therefore very important to control drugs following approval and to look out for these differences between men and women."mycardial	Epidemiology	"to define and implement an algorithm, based on current databases, in order to estimate acute myocardial infarction (AMI) incidence in six Italian areas.Local Health Units of Firenze and Venezia, and the municipalities of Pisa, Roma, Taranto, and Torino.residents in the above mentioned six areas in the period 2002-2004, for a total of about 4,447,000 subjects (30th June 2003).acute myocardial infarction incident cases were identified through hospitalization databases and causes of death. Hospital discharges (excluding outpatient discharges) with ICD9-CM code 410* as primary discharge diagnosis, or as secondary diagnosis when associated with selected codes suggestive of ischemic symptoms in primary diagnosis, and deaths with the ICD9-CM code 410* as underlying cause were selected. Patients without a previous hospitalization for ICD9-CM codes 410* and 412* during the previous 60 months were considered as incident cases. Crude, age-specific and age-standardized incidence rates (standard: total Italian population at the 2001 census) were calculated. A number of data quality indicators were also evaluated.age-standardized incidence rates show different levels of incidence in the areas included in the study. Both for males and females, higher incidence is observed in Rome and Turin (males: respectively 260.5 and 260.2 cases/100,000; females: 105.6 cases/100,000 in both areas). The lowest incidence is observed in Taranto (males: 219.5 cases/100,000; females: 87.0 cases/100,000). Quality indicators suggest a good comparability of incidence estimates among the studied areas. In particular, in both genders, the differences observed in the incidence rates are consistent with the differences of current AMI mortality rates.although limitations in data comparability among the studied areas and in the quality of disease coding cannot be completely excluded, results suggest that the algorithm we used provides estimates of AMI incidence rates comparable among the studied areas. Only a validation study with standardized criteria will make it possible to more closely evaluate the diagnostic quality and comparability of AMI cases identified through this algorithm."mycardial	Clinical	"To compare gender-related normal limits for left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV and ESV), obtained using two myocardial perfusion-gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) quantification methods. A total of 185 patients were retrospectively selected from a consecutive series of patients examined for coronary artery disease (CAD) or for management of known CAD. Patients were included in the study group if they had normal or probably normal results with stress and rest perfusion imaging and if the combined interpretation of perfusion studies and gated rest studies showed no signs or suspicion of myocardial infarction. The gated SPECT studies were performed using a 2-day stress/gated rest Tc-99m sestamibi protocol. All patient studies were processed using CAFU and quantitative-gated SPECT (QGS), the two software packages for quantification of gated SPECT images. The lower normal limits for EF were higher for CAFU compared with QGS for both women (59% versus 53%) and men (54% versus 47%). The upper normal limits for EDV were also higher for CAFU compared with QGS for both women (133 versus 107 ml) and men (182 versus 161 ml). The differences between the software packages were small for ESV (women 44 versus 44 ml; men 69 versus 74 ml). Gender-specific normal limits need to be applied for LV EF and volumes determined by gated SPECT. Separate criteria for abnormal LV EF and EDV need to be used for women and men depending on the software package used."mycardial	Management	"The purpose of this study was to determine whether, in recent years, sex differences in the type of care during coronary artery bypass graft surgery procedures occurred.Between 1995 and 2004, 5,935 consecutive patients (4,867 men and 1,068 women) underwent isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery; propensity score matching was used to investigate whether sex adversely impacts standard care and early outcomes of coronary revascularization.Of the 1,068 women undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery, only 280 (26.2%) were matched on propensity scores with men. Distribution of preoperative variables among matched pairs was, on average, equal. Propensity-matched women received similar number of distal anastomoses as men (2.70 +/- 0.89 versus 2.82 +/- 0.97; p = 0.13), had similar rates of complete revascularization (82.5% versus 81.6%; p = 0.78), and of off-pump procedures (24.3% versus 27.5%; p = 0.39); also, the rate of utilization of arterial grafts (left internal mammary artery 98.5% versus 98.2%; p = 0.73; right internal mammary artery 3.2% versus 3.2%; p > 0.99; radial artery 8.2% versus 9.6%; p = 0.55), as well as the number of distal anastomoses performed with arterial grafts (1.11 +/- 0.36 versus 1.13 +/- 0.39; p = 0.47), were similar in women and men. No differences were detected in major complications (in-hospital mortality, perioperative myocardial infarction, and stroke) in propensity-matched pairs, whereas women had lower reexploration for bleeding and blood transfusion rates.The preoperative profiles of women and men were markedly different, as only one fourth of women could be matched. In the current era, after adjustment for preoperative variables, female patients received the same standard of care as men, with improved results in some minor early outcomes."mycardial	Epidemiology	"This study examined whether inflammation adds to the prediction of coronary heart disease (CHD) beyond metabolic syndrome (MetS), and whether these associations differ between sexes.Among 30,111 women from the Nurses' Health Study and 16,695 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study without prior cardiovascular disease, 249 women and 266 men developed non-fatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD during 8 and 6 years of follow-up, respectively. Controls were selected 2:1 within each cohort matched on age, smoking, and date of blood draw. Subjects with MetS had a significantly increased relative risk (RR) of CHD compared to individuals without MetS, and this RR was significantly higher in women (3.01; 95%-CI 1.98-4.57) than in men (1.62; 95%-CI 1.13-2.33; p interaction=0.03). Adjustment for most inflammatory markers did not substantially attenuate the risk estimates, although the association was no longer significant in men after adjustment for CRP. Vice versa, associations of inflammatory markers with CHD risk among women were no longer significant after further adjustment for MetS. Among men, CRP and sICAM remained significant predictors of CHD independent of MetS.MetS is a stronger predictor of CHD in women than in men. Most inflammatory markers did not add appreciable information beyond MetS to predict CHD; only CRP and sICAM remained independently predictive of CHD among men. The basis for these sex-based differences warrants further study."mycardial	Management	"Data comparing survival outcomes for women versus men transported for pPCI were absent.To assess the impact of gender on 30-day mortality of patients with STEMI transported for pPCI.The data from the PRAGUE-1 and PRAGUE-2 trials were analysed. Studies compared thrombolysis in the community hospital and pPCI after transportation to cardiocentre. A group of 520 patients treated with thrombolysis, and 530 transported for pPCI, were analysed.Women were older, with a higher risk profile. They had longer ischaemia time. Mortality of patients treated with TL was significantly higher in women than in men (15% vs 9%, p = 0.043). There was no significant gender difference in mortality in the PCI group (8.2% of women vs 6.2% of men, p = 0.409). Mortality of women treated with on-site TL was nearly twice as high as mortality of women transported for pPCI (p = 0.043). After adjustment in a multivariate model the odds ratio for mortality in women was 0.74 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.05; p = 0.556).Long-distance transportation of women with STEMI from a community hospital to a tertiary PCI centre is a significantly more effective treatment strategy than on-site TL. Gender did not determine survival in patients transported for pPCI."mycardial	Review	"The purpose of this article is to review the literature on gender differences in knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about heart disease. Despite the significant problem of cardiac disease among women, surveys of women's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about the risks of heart disease have continually identified substantial gaps in women's knowledge. Overall, knowledge of heart disease, identification of risk factors for coronary artery disease, signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was poor for both men and women. The perception that women are less knowledgeable than men about heart disease was not consistent in the literature reviewed. In fact, in some studies, women were more knowledgeable than men in the identification of risk factors and less common symptoms of AMI."mycardial	Management	"Aspirin is effective for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, but it remains unclear for which subgroups of individuals aspirin is beneficial. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of aspirin separately for men and women of different ages with various levels of cardiovascular disease risk.A Markov model was developed to predict the number of cardiovascular events prevented, quality-adjusted life-years, and costs over a 10-year period. Event rates were taken from Dutch population data, and the relative effectiveness of aspirin was taken from a gender-specific meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results. In 55-year-old persons, aspirin prevented myocardial infarctions in men (127 events per 100,000 person-years) and ischemic strokes in women (17 events per 100,000 person-years). Aspirin implies a net investment and a quality-adjusted life-year gain in men 55 years of age; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 111,949 euros per quality-adjusted life-year (1 euro=$1.27 as of June 2007). Aspirin was cost-effective for 55- and 65-year-old men with moderate cardiovascular risk and men 75 years of age (10-year cardiovascular disease risk >10%). Conversely, aspirin was beneficial for women 65 years of age with high cardiovascular risk and women 75 years of age with moderate cardiovascular risk (10-year cardiovascular disease risk >15%). Results were sensitive to drug treatment costs, effectiveness of aspirin treatment, and utility of taking aspirin.Aspirin treatment for primary prevention is cost-effective for men with a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of >10% and for women with a risk of >15%. This occurs much later in life for women than men. Therefore, opportunities for the primary prevention of aspirin seem limited in women, and a differentiated preventive strategy seems warranted."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Conflicting evidence exists regarding gender differences in the management and outcomes of myocardial infarctions (MIs). In this study, it was hypothesized that the management and outcomes of MIs would not differ by gender after proper adjustment for age, access to care, MI characteristics, and co-morbidities. Data from a published MI validation study, which sampled 2,200 MI hospitalizations in Medicare beneficiaries with the prescription drug benefit for detailed hospital chart review, were used. Gender differences in the use of MI-related procedures and recommended cardiovascular medications as well as short- and long-term mortality were assessed using multivariate regression. A total of 1,625 patients were identified (80% women) with confirmed MIs for whom complete clinical information was available. Compared with men, women were older and had higher body mass index. Women were more likely to have diabetes, renal dysfunction, and depression, but less likely to have had previous MIs, chronic lung disease, cancer, and to use tobacco. The characteristics of the index MIs were similar, except for non-Q-wave MIs being more common in men. The management of the MIs during admission was similar. During follow-up of up to 6.6 years, men were 40% more likely to die than women (95% confidence interval 21% to 62%), but no mortality difference was observed in patients aged 65 to 74 years (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 1.36), whereas in those aged > or =75 years, men were more likely to die than women (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 1.82). In conclusion, for older patients, the management of MIs did not significantly differ between men and women. Men, especially those aged > or =75 years, however, had worse short- and long-term prognoses compared with women of a similar age. The mortality was highest and the gender effect was more pronounced during the MI hospitalizations."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Women and men have different clinical presentations and outcomes in coronary artery disease (CAD). We tested the hypothesis that sex differences may influence coronary atherosclerotic burden and coronary endothelial function before development of obstructive CAD.A total of 142 patients (53 men, 89 women; mean +/- SD age, 49.3 +/- 11.7 years) with early CAD simultaneously underwent intravascular ultrasonography and coronary endothelial function assessment. Atheroma burden in the left main and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) arteries was significantly greater in men than women (median, 23.0% vs. 14.1%, P = 0.002; median, 40.1% vs. 29.3%, P = 0.001, respectively). Atheroma eccentricity in the proximal LAD artery was significantly higher in men than women (median, 0.89 vs. 0.80, P = 0.04). The length of the coronary segments with endothelial dysfunction was significantly longer in men than women (median, 39.2 vs. 11.1 mm, P = 0.002). In contrast, maximal coronary flow reserve was significantly lower in women than men (2.80 vs. 3.30, P < 0.001). Sex was an independent predictor of atheroma burden in the left main and proximal LAD arteries (both P < 0.05) by multivariate analysis.Men have greater atheroma burden, more eccentric atheroma, and more diffuse epicardial endothelial dysfunction than women. These results suggest that men have more severe structural and functional abnormalities in epicardial coronary arteries than women, even in patients with early atherosclerosis, which may result in the higher incidence rates of CAD and ST-segment myocardial infarction in men than women."mycardial	Outcomes	"In this paper, the authors evaluate gender related differences of myocardial infarction mortality before and after hospital admittance. Myocardial infarction mortality in the Clinical Hospital Split in the seven years period between 2000 and 2006, have been analyzed together with out of hospital sudden death patients with acute myocardial infarction established during autopsy. During the seven year period between 2000 and 2006, 3434 patients were treated for myocardial infarction in the Split Clinical Hospital, 2336 (68%) males and 1098 (32%) females with a 12% total mortality (427 patients). The annual number of hospitalized persons has been increasing during that period (474 in yr. 2000 us. 547 in yr. 2006), while mortality decreased from 15% in 2000 to 9.6% in 2006. Female patients had significantly higher hospital mortality than male patients, (228 or 21% vs. 202 or 9%, p<0.05). Women also had significantly higher total AMI mortality (23.7% vs. 15,7%, p <0.05). Anterior myocardial infarction with ST elevation in precordial leads had significantly higher mortality (19%) compared to patients with lateral (11%), inferior (10%) myocardial infarction with ST elevation and also NSTEMI (4%) mortality p<0.05. Female patients more frequently die in hospital, 84% (230) than out of hospital 16% (43). From the total number of AMI deaths (388) in male patients, 56% (217) were in hospital and 44% (171) out of hospital (p<0.001). Men had significantly higher prehospital mortality rate than women (81% vs. 19%, p<0.05). Men also more frequently died from ventricular fibrillation (22% vs. 10%, p<0.05), while women died more frequently of heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and myocardial rupture (33% vs. 15% p<0.05). Regarding the total number of deaths from myocardial infarction men had significantly higher prehospital mortality compared to women (178 or 7.3% vs. 43 or 3.7%, p<0.05). Anterior myocardial infarction had a significantly higher rate in patients dying pre-hospital (58%), in contrast to inferior (36%) and lateral myocardial infarction with ST elevation (6%) p<0.05. We have concluded that male patients die more frequently within the first few hours of AMI mostly due to malignant arrhythmias, while female patients died in sub acute stage due to heart failure while being hospitalized. Nevertheless total mortality of AMI remains significantly higher in women."mycardial	Management	"Few studies have examined the time between onset of myocardial infarction (MI) symptoms and arrival at hospital (prehospital delay time) and symptoms in men vs. women.To describe prehospital delay time and symptoms in men vs. women with MI and to analyse trends over time and according to age.The Northern Sweden MONICA myocardial infarction registry, 1989-2003, included 5,072 men and 1,470 women with a confirmed MI.Typical pain was present in 86% of the men and 81% of the women. The proportion with typical symptoms decreased over time for men and increased for women. Typical symptoms were more common among younger persons than older persons. Insufficiently reported symptoms was unchanged in men over time and decreased among women. Up to the age of 65, no gender differences were seen in the prehospital delay. In the oldest age group (65-74 years) time to hospital was longer than among the younger groups, especially among women.There were no major gender differences in prehospital delay or type of symptoms. However, over time the proportion with typical symptoms decreased in men and increased in women. Older patients had longer prehospital delay and less typical symptoms."mycardial	Clinical	"Many observational and randomised studies have suggested that women are referred for invasive diagnostics and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) less frequently than men, and the effects of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) among women are worse than in men.To compare direct results of PCI in men and women.The study was a retrospective assessment of case records of one thousand consecutive patients treated with PCI because of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (344 patients), unstable angina (UA) (164 patients) and stable angina (SA) (492 patients). We examined the effects of demographic, angiographic and clinical variables on the duration of hospitalisation and in-hospital mortality separately in men and in women.Women constituted 30.7% of patients treated with PCI because of AMI, 39.6% of those with UA and just 25.8% of those with SA. Women were significantly older than men, had a higher BMI, and more often suffered from hypertension and diabetes. The duration of hospitalisation was the same in men and women if the reason for PCI was SA or UA, however, in case of AMI women were hospitalised significantly longer than men. In the univariate analysis gender had no influence on in-hospital mortality regardless of the reason for PCI treatment. Among the variables subjected to multivariate analysis female gender, age, BMI, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, indication for PCI, final TIMI flow in the target vessel and cardiogenic shock as a complication of AMI were shown to affect mortality. Significant effects on in-hospital mortality for women were exhibited only by cardiogenic shock. Among men, indication for PCI, age, diabetes and final TIMI flow in the target vessel also had a significant influence on in-hospital mortality.Stable angina is a reason for performing PCI more rarely in women than in men. Women with CAD are older than men and have more risk factors. The in-hospital mortality among patients treated with PCI because of SA is independent of gender. Cardiogenic shock appeared to be the only factor that influences in-hospital mortality in women. In the case of men such an influence is also observed for indication for PCI (AMI, UA or SA), diabetes and final TIMI flow in the target vessel."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of complex diseases such as myocardial infarction (MI), the leading cause of death in men and women. Women develop MI approximately 10 years later than men, a difference that could be explained by the genes coding for the estrogen receptors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ESR2 gene may affect susceptibility for MI in a sex-dependent manner.A nested case-control design was used to analyze 3 polymorphisms of the ESR2 gene and their associated haplotypes in 710 myocardial infarction cases from the REGICOR (Registre GironÃ­ del CorazÃ³n) study and 2379 controls randomly selected in a representative population of a Spanish cross-sectional study.The rs1271572 T allele was significantly more common in patients who developed MI (P < 0.001). No association was observed for rs1256049 or rs4986938. Assuming a dominant model of inheritance, the association, as determined by logistic multivariate regression after adjustment for conventional cardiac risk factors, remained statistically significant in men [odds ratio (OR) 1.65, 95% CI 1.18-2.30; P = 0.003) but not in women (P = 0.754). A very common haplotype encompassing the rs1271572 variant was also associated with the risk of MI in the overall population (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.06-1.87; P = 0.020) and in men (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.12-2.21; P = 0.009).The rs1271572 SNP T variant was associated with increased risk of MI in a Spanish population, and this association was found to be limited to men only. Sex differences in the genetic risk merit further investigation."mycardial	Epidemiology	"This paper is a report of a study to explore gender differences in psychosocial aspects in the year prior to first-time myocardial infarction, and the association between these aspects and pre-hospital delay.The time from symptom onset to hospital admission is critical for patient survival; therefore influences on pre-hospital delay are of interest. The prevalence of stressful psychosocial factors is higher among patients before acute myocardial infarction than among healthy controls.Patients diagnosed with first-time acute myocardial infarction were recruited from five Norwegian hospitals over a 13-month period in 2003-2004. Of 738 eligible patients, 149 women and 384 men completed a self-administered questionnaire (response rate 72%).Depression, high family stress, high work stress and major life events had no statistically significant impact on patient delay or total pre-hospital delay. Depression, sleep disturbances and high family stress were reported among more women than men in the year prior to the event. Women and men aged 65 years and younger were more likely to report major depression and major life events than those older than 65. Low education and low partner education predicted prolonged patient delay in men but not in women. Low partner education also predicted prolonged total pre-hospital delay in men.The process between symptom onset and hospital admittance is complex, and more knowledge about factors influencing this process is vital to reduce pre-hospital delay. Significant others should be included in information-giving in relation to myocardial infarction as they seem to play a vital role in patients' decision-making processes."mycardial	Management	"Mortality from acute coronary syndrome has historically been higher in women as compared with men. We hypothesized that adoption of a more sensitive definition for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and managing patients according to the 2000 European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology guidelines would reduce this difference.A retrospective cohort study was conducted of all acute coronary syndrome admissions to 7 regional tertiary hospitals in Israel during 1999-2004. The primary end point was all-cause 1-year mortality. Differences in risk between men and women were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression.The number of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome was 20,206 and 15,583 before and after adoption of the guidelines, respectively. An invasive strategy during the index hospitalization was more frequent in men in both the pre- (47.6% vs 33.6, P <.001) and post- (55.7% vs 40.9%, P <.001) transition periods. Secondary prevention was intensified in the post-transition period in both sexes. Multivariate analysis adjusting for differences in baseline clinical characteristics between men and women and invasive strategy demonstrated that female sex was associated with increased 1-year mortality during the pretransition period (hazard ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval, 1.24-1.45), but was not a significant factor in the post-transition period (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.14).The transition to the 2000 European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology guidelines was associated with a reduction in the sex-based mortality difference in patients with acute coronary syndrome despite the fact that an early invasive strategy and secondary prevention continued to be underutilized in female patients in both periods."mycardial	Management	"Previous anesthesia information management systems-based studies have focused on intraoperative data analysis. Reviewing preoperative data could provide insight into the outpatient treatment of patients presenting for surgical procedures. As gender-based disparities have been demonstrated in the treatment of patients with cardiac disease, we hypothesized that there would be gender disparities in the outpatient pharmacologic management of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery.We analyzed electronic medical records of ambulatory patients with CAD (prior myocardial infarction [MI], coronary artery bypass surgery, and angioplasty with or without stenting, angina) presenting for elective noncardiac surgery between 1/2004 and 6/2006 (30 mo) at an inner city hospital.Of 21,039 ambulatory patients seen in the preanesthesia clinic, 6.4% (1346) had CAD. Patients with CAD: Men were more likely to be taking beta-blockers (P < 0.002), statins (P < 0.0001), aspirin (P < 0.0001), and antiplatelet medications (P < 0.04), although there was a trend of increased use of aspirin (P < 0.01) by women over the course of the study. Patients with history of prior MI: Men with a prior MI were more likely to be taking beta-blockers (P < 0.0001) and statins (P < 0.02), although there was a trend of increased use of beta-blockers (P < 0.0005) and aspirin (P < 0.03) by women over the course of the study. Quarterly prevalence rates for outpatient medication use were greatest for beta-blockers and least for aspirin. Patients were more likely to be taking a statin, aspirin, or oral antiplatelet medication if they were receiving chronic beta-blocker therapy (P < 0.0001 for each medication).Aggregating anesthesia management information systems data provides an epidemiological perspective of community care of patients presenting for surgery. We found that gender disparities in outpatient medical treatment of patients with CAD, which previously favored men, have diminished primarily as a result of increased use of these medications in women. Nonetheless, despite evidence supporting the use of risk-reduction strategies, our patients are undertreated with standard medical therapies."mycardial	Outcomes	"Few population studies have evaluated the associations of both coronary artery calcium (CAC) and carotid ultrasound with cardiovascular events, especially in adults >70 years of age. At the Pittsburgh Field Center of the Cardiovascular Health Study, 559 men and women, mean age 80.2 (SD 4.1) years had CAC score assessed by electron beam computerized tomographic scan and common and internal carotid artery intimal medial wall thickness (CCA-IMT and ICA-IMT) by carotid ultrasound between 1998 and 2000 and were followed for total and incident cardiovascular disease events through June 2003. Crude rates and hazard ratios for total and incident events were examined with and without adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. After 5 years, there were 127 cardiovascular disease events, 48 myocardial infarctions or cardiovascular disease deaths, and 28 strokes or stroke deaths. Total and incident cardiovascular disease event rates were higher in each quartile of CAC and CCA-IMT, but not of ICA-IMT. For total cardiovascular disease, the adjusted hazard ratio for the fourth versus first quartile of CAC was 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.9) and for CCA-IMT was 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.1). The CCA-IMT was more strongly related to stroke risk than was CAC, although CAC was also an important predictor of stroke. No significant gender differences were found, although relative risks appeared to be stronger in women, especially for stroke. In conclusion, in adults >70 years of age, CAC and CCA-IMT had similar hazard ratios for total cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease. The CCA-IMT was more strongly related to stroke than CAC, but CAC was also a predictor of stroke."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Few studies have explored the factors affecting women's decisions to seek medical assistance at the onset of cardiac symptoms. Although some studies have shown that there are gender differences between men and women in terms of how they cope with having a myocardial infarction (MI) and heart disease, few have explored how women actually experience MI and what influences their help-seeking behaviour. Those studies that have, suggest that women often fail to recognize the signs of MI and delay seeking treatment for symptoms of MI longer than men do. This qualitative study explores the female experience of MI, focusing on some of the thought processes and coping strategies used by women when having an MI. Using a grounded theory research approach, 25 post-MI female patients were interviewed about their experiences during acute MI. Through analysing and coding data, a number of categories emerged that provide insight into the health seeking behaviour of women at the onset of MI. Emergent categories were: a delay in seeking help (main category); an engendered perception of heart disease (sub-category); not recognizing symptoms (sub-category); maintaining control through self-medication (sub-category). Analysis of the data suggests that when experiencing an MI, women delay seeking help for a number of reasons, including not recognizing symptoms, perceiving heart disease as a 'male' problem and preferring to self-medicate."mycardial	Management	"Statins, antiplatelet drugs, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors may produce marked benefits in secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), especially in combination.To examine trends in treatment and factors associated with treatment using a population-based general practice database.Analysis of routinely collected computerised data from 201 general practices using iSOFT software contributing to the DIN-LINK database.Subjects aged >or=35 years and registered with the practices; on average, 30 000 men and 21 000 women with IHD each year.Percentage of subjects with IHD receiving individual drugs and combined treatment in any given year.Between 1994 and 2005 use of drugs for secondary prevention increased markedly. By 2005, 80% of men and 70% of women were receiving a statin, 75% and 74% were receiving antiplatelet drugs, 55% and 48% were receiving beta-blockers and 57% and 51% were receiving an ACE inhibitor; 55% of men and 46% of women were receiving a statin, antiplatelet drug and either beta-blocker or ACE inhibitor, of whom just under half were receiving all four classes of drug. Gender differences were largely explained by more severe disease in men. In 2005, subjects less likely to receive combination therapy were older, had not had a myocardial infarction or revascularisation, and lacked comorbidities such as diabetes or hypertension.Despite high levels of statin and antiplatelet prescribing, opportunities exist for increasing the benefits of secondary prevention, especially through the wider use of combined treatments. Future targets could usefully include combination therapy."mycardial	Outcomes	"The clinical outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is poorer in women than that in men. This study aimed at comparing the impact of gender difference on the strategy of primary PCI in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).Two hundred and fifty-nine patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI within 12 hours of symptom onset were enrolled. The male group consisted of 143 men aged > 55 years, and a female group included 116 women without age limitation. Procedural success was defined as residual stenosis < 20% with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade > 2 and without death, emergency bypass surgery or disabling cerebral events during the hospitalization. The rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization during follow-up, was recorded.Female patients were more hypertensive and diabetic and with fewer cigarette smokers than male counterparts. The prevalence of angiographic 3-vessel disease was higher in the female group, but the procedural success rate was comparable between the two groups (94.4% vs 92.2%). The occurrence rate of MACE did not differ during the hospitalization (4.2% vs 6.0%, P = 0.50), but was significantly higher in the female group during follow-up (mean (16.0 +/- 11.2) months) than that in the male group (5.4% vs 0.7%, P = 0.02).Despite a similar success rate of primary PCI and in-hospital outcomes in both genders, female patients with acute STEMI still have a worse prognosis during the long-term follow-up."mycardial	Management	"Historically gender differences existed in treatment and outcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI).To assess gender aspects of contemporary treatment and adherence to ACC/AHA Class-I Treatment Guidelines in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).We studied 2024 consecutive patients (519 women, 26%); 1026 (51%) with ST-elevation (STE)-MI and 998 (49%) patients with non-STE (NSTE), during a nationwide ACS-survey, conducted during 2-months in 2004.Women were older than men (71 vs. 59 in STEMI; 71 vs. 64 years in NSTE-ACS patients), and had worse cardiovascular risk profiles. In STEMI-patients, acute reperfusion was less frequent in women than in men (53% vs. 63%, respectively, p=0.01; non-significant after age-adjustment). At discharge, fewer women received ACE-inhibitors/ARBs (71% vs. 75%, respectively; OR(age-adj)=0.69[0.48-0.98]). Among NSTE-ACS patients, fewer women received IIb/IIIa-inhibitors (12% vs. 21%, respectively, p=0.007; OR(age-adj)=0.58[0.36-0.96]) and clopidogrel at discharge (49% vs. 59%, respectively, p=0.005; OR(age-adj) 0.75[0.56-1.01]). No gender differences were noted in utilization of aspirin, beta-blockers or statins. Age-adjusted and covariate-adjusted mortality rates were comparable in women and men with STEMI (at 7-days 4.3% vs. 4.1%; OR(adj)=0.95[0.47-1.87] and at 1-year 13.8% vs. 9.8%, hazard ratio [HR(adj)]=1.11[0.73-1.70], respectively); in women and men with NSTE-ACS (at 7-days 1.3% vs. 2.1%, OR(adj)=0.65[0.20-1.76], and at 1-year 12.0% vs. 11.3%; HR(adj)=1.19[0.80-1.77], respectively).In 2004, adherence to ACC/AHA Class-I Treatment Guidelines in ACS-patients was satisfactory. Relative underutilization of acute reperfusion was noted among STEMI patients, without gender differences after age-adjustment. At discharge, less women received ACE-inhibitors/ARBs. Among NSTE-ACS patients, less women than men received IIb/IIIa-inhibitors, and clopidogrel at discharge. Contemporary ACS management was associated with similar adjusted outcome in women and men."mycardial	Outcomes	"Women receive less evidence-based medical care than men and have higher rates of death after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). It is unclear whether efforts undertaken to improve AMI care have mitigated these sex disparities in the current era.Using the Get With the Guidelines-Coronary Artery Disease database, we examined sex differences in care processes and in-hospital death among 78 254 patients with AMI in 420 US hospitals from 2001 to 2006. Women were older, had more comorbidities, less often presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and had higher unadjusted in-hospital death (8.2% versus 5.7%; P<0.0001) than men. After multivariable adjustment, sex differences in in-hospital mortality rates were no longer observed in the overall AMI cohort (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.04; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.10) but persisted among STEMI patients (10.2% versus 5.5%; P<0.0001; adjusted OR=1.12; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.23). Compared with men, women were less likely to receive early aspirin treatment (adjusted OR=0.86; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.90), early beta-blocker treatment (adjusted OR=0.90; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.93), reperfusion therapy (adjusted OR=0.75; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.80), or timely reperfusion (door-to-needle time </=30 minutes: adjusted OR=0.78; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.92; door-to-balloon time </=90 minutes: adjusted OR=0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95). Women also experienced lower use of cardiac catheterization and revascularization procedures after AMI.Overall, no sex differences in in-hospital mortality rates after AMI were observed after multivariable adjustment. However, women with STEMI had higher adjusted mortality rates than men. The underuse of evidence-based treatments and delayed reperfusion among women represent potential opportunities for reducing sex disparities in care and outcome after AMI."mycardial	Outcomes	"Progress in management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) might have changed the effect of gender on mortality.From May 1981 to November 2002, 1984 consecutive patients with AMI underwent emergency coronary angiography. They were divided into three groups in chronological order: group I (1981-1988, n=564); group II (1989-1995, n=678); and group III (1997-2002, n=742). Multi-variable analysis was performed using Cox's proportional hazard regression, adjusting baseline clinical and angiographical variables.There were 405 women (20%). Thrombolysis was most frequently performed in group I (50%), balloon angioplasty in group II (71%), and stent in group III (66%), with no difference in the allocation of reperfusion therapy between men and women. Three-year mortality was significantly higher in women than in men in group I (27% vs 18%, p=0.03) and group II (23% vs 15%, p=0.048). In group III, there was no significant difference in 3-year mortality (12% vs 10%, p=0.66) between women and men. Women were associated with higher age, more diabetes, more hypertension, fewer current smokers, and less previous infarction than men. Multi-variable analysis showed that sex was not an independent predictor of 3-year mortality in the three groups.Women with AMI who were treated mostly with primary intervention using stent in the contemporary era had similar mortality to men."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To analyse gender differences in prognosis, risk factors and evidence-based treatment in patients with diabetes and myocardial infarction.Mortality in 1995-2002 was analysed in 70 882 Swedish patients (age <80) with a first registry-recorded acute myocardial infarction stratified by gender and age. Owing to gender differences in mortality, specifically characterising patients below the age of 65 years, a more detailed analysis was performed within this cohort of 25 555 patients. In this group, 5786 (23%) were women and 4473 (18%) had diabetes. Differences in clinical and other parameters were adjusted for using a propensity score model.Long-term mortality in diabetic patients aged <65 years was significantly higher in women than men (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.55). Compared with diabetic men, women had an increased risk factor burden (hypertension 49 vs 43%; RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.20; heart failure 10 vs 8%; RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.53). Diabetic women aged <65 years were less frequently treated with intravenous beta-blockade during the acute hospital phase and with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at hospital discharge. However, this under-use was not associated with the mortality differences, nor was female gender by itself.Women below 65 years of age with diabetes have a poorer outcome than men after a myocardial infarction. This relates to an increased risk factor burden. It is suggested that greater awareness of this situation and improved prevention have the potential to improve what is an unfavourable situation for these women."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Recent awareness of cardiovascular diseases as a number one killer of the middle-aged women has prompted interest in sex differences leading to heart failure (HF). Therefore, we evaluated cardiac function in female and male mice following myocardial infarction (MI) using the Millar pressure-volume (P-V) conductance system in vivo, at time points corresponding to early (2 wk), late compensatory hypertrophy (4 wk), and decompensation (10 wk) to HF. A significant deterioration of the load dependent and independent hemodynamic measurements occurred in both female and male mice during the early phase of hypertrophy. Later, compensatory hypertrophy was marked by a normalization of volumes to control levels in females compared with males. The most notable differences between sexes occurred in the measurements of cardiac contractility during the decompensation to HF. In females, there was a significant improvement in contractility compared with males, which was apparent in the load-independent measurements of preload recruitable stroke work (10 wk post-MI, female=48.7+/-8.0 vs. male=25.2+/-1.8 mmHg, P<0.05) and maximum dP/dt vs. maximum end-diastolic volume (10 wk post-MI, female=359+/-58 vs. male=149+/-28 mmHg.s(-1).microl(-1), P<0.05). Despite these differences, there were no differences in the heart weight to body weight ratio and infarct size between the sexes. These data demonstrate that compensatory hypertrophy is associated with an improvement in contractility and a delayed decompensation to HF in females. However, compensatory hypertrophy in males appears to be undermined by a steady decline in contractility associated with decompensation to HF."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a complex disease. Multiple genes and their interaction with various environmental factors influence the pathogenesis of MI that is thought to be tightly regulated by inflammatory pathways. Recent progress in genetic analysis includes the use of large-scale genome-wide association studies that have proven to be powerful tools even in the analysis of multifactorial phenotypes. However, certain genes are only sparsely represented on the available gene chips and additional candidate gene approaches are necessary. One such example is the CNR2 gene, encoding the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), which has been implicated in mediating anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in vivo. We therefore hypothesized that genetic variations within the CNR2 gene are associated with the development of MI or classic cardiovascular risk factors. In a large case-control study, 1,968 individuals from the German MI family study were examined with 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering CNR2 and the adjacent genes. The association of these SNPs with MI or cardiovascular risk factors, such as arterial hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus, was determined. In allelic and genotypic models, none of the SNPs showed a significant association with MI. Separate analyses for men and women revealed no gender-specific relationship between common genetic variations within the CNR2 gene and MI. Moreover, no significant association between CNR2 gene variants and common cardiovascular risk factors was observed. We therefore provide evidence in a large German population that common polymorphisms within the CNR2 gene confer no susceptibility to MI or to cardiovascular risk factors."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCH) is an inherited dyslipidaemia that is related to a high risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). We evaluated the prevalence of CAD in a large FCH population and the association of risk factors with CAD according to gender.In this single-center, observational study, lipid and lipoprotein variables were measured in untreated patients with FCH (565 males and 302 females). CAD was defined as a documented history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, or an abnormal coronary angiogram (stenosis of >50% in an epicardial coronary artery), or angina plus abnormal imaging stress test.Males had higher triglyceride level (P<0.001) but lower total cholesterol (P<0.001) and HDL-cholesterol level (P<0.001) compared to women. The prevalence of CAD was 22.2% in men and 4.6% in women (P<0.001). In logistic regression analysis, male gender was associated with a higher risk of CAD independent of lipid parameters and other risk factors (adjusted ORs for CAD 9.4, P<0.001). In gender-specific analysis, age (OR=1.06 per 1-year increase, P<0.001), diabetes (OR=2.42, P<0.01) and Lp(a) (OR=1.09 per 1-mg/dL increase, P<0.01) were independent predictors of CAD in men. In women, age (OR=1.24, P<0.01), total cholesterol (OR=1.022 per 1-mg/dL increase, P<0.05) and fasting glucose (OR=1.031 per 1-mg/dL increase, P<0.05) were independently associated with CAD.In FCH patients, the prevalence of CAD is higher in males than in females, independent of lipidaemic profile and other risk factors. Among lipid variables, Lp(a) and cholesterol level are predictors of CAD in males and females respectively."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death among men and women globally. Women develop CHD about 10 years later than men, yet the reasons for this are unclear. The purpose of this report is to determine if differences in risk factor distributions exist between women and men across various age categories to help explain why women develop acute MI later than men.We used the INTERHEART global case-control study including 27 098 participants from 52 countries, 6787 of whom were women. The median age of first acute MI was higher in women than men (65 vs. 56 years; P < 0.0001). Nine modifiable risk factors were associated with MI in women and men. Hypertension [2.95(2.66 -3.28) vs. 2.32(2.16-2.48)], diabetes [4.26(3.68-4.94) vs. 2.67(2.43-2.94), physical activity [0.48(0.41-0.57) vs. 0.77(0.71-0.83)], and moderate alcohol use [0.41(0.34-0.50) vs. 0.88(0.82-0.94)] were more strongly associated with MI among women than men. The association of abnormal lipids, current smoking, abdominal obesity, high risk diet, and psychosocial stress factors with MI was similar in women and men. Risk factors associations were generally stronger among younger individuals compared to older women and men. The population attributable risk (PAR) of all nine risk factors exceeded 94%, and was similar among women and men (96 vs. 93%). Men were significantly more likely to suffer a MI prior to 60 years of age than were women, however, after adjusting for levels of risk factors, the sex difference in the probability of MI cases occurring before the age of 60 years was reduced by more than 80%.Women experience their first acute MI on average 9 years later than men. Nine modifiable risk factors are significantly associated with acute MI in both men and women and explain greater than 90% of the PAR. The difference in age of first MI is largely explained by the higher risk factor levels at younger ages in men compared to women."mycardial	Outcomes	"The registration of non-fatal and fatal MI events initiated 1985 in the WHO MONICA project has been ongoing in northern Sweden since the end of the WHO project in 1995. The purpose of the present study was to analyze gender differences in first and recurrent events, case fatality and mortality in myocardial infarction (MI) in Northern Sweden during the 20-year period 1985 - 2004.Diagnosed MI events in subjects aged 25-64 years in the Counties of Norrbotten and VÃ¤sterbotten were validated according to the MONICA protocol. The total number of events registered up to January 1, 2005 was 11,763: 9,387 in men and 2,376 in women.The proportion of male/female events has decreased from 5.5:1 to 3:1. For males the reductions were 30% and 70% for first and recurrent MI, respectively, and for women 0% and 40% in the 55-64 year group. For both sexes a 50% reduction in 28-day case fatality was seen in the 25-64 year-group. Mortality was reduced by 69% and 45% in men and women, respectively.First and recurrent events of myocardial infarction was markedly reduced in men over the 20-year observation period, but for women the reduction was seen only for recurrent infarctions. Case fatality, on the other hand, was markedly reduced for both sexes. As a result of the positive effects on incidence and case fatality a substantial reduction was seen in total mortality, most pronounced for men."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Seasonal patterns in cardiac disease in the northern hemisphere are well described in the literature. More recently age and gender differences in cardiac mortality and to a lesser extent morbidity have been presented. To date spatial differences between the seasonal patterns of cardiac disease has not been presented. Literature relating to seasonal patterns in cardiac disease in the southern hemisphere and in Australia in particular is scarce. The aim of this paper is to describe the seasonal, age, gender, and spatial patterns of cardiac disease in Melbourne Australia by using acute myocardial infarction admissions to hospital as a marker of cardiac disease.There were 33,165 Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) admissions over 2186 consecutive days. There is a seasonal pattern in AMI admissions with increased rates during the colder months. The peak month is July. The admissions rate is greater for males than for females, although this difference decreases with advancing age. The maximal AMI season for males extends from April to November. The difference between months of peak and minimum admissions was 33.7%. Increased female AMI admissions occur from May to November, with a variation between peak and minimum of 23.1%. Maps of seasonal AMI admissions demonstrate spatial differences. Analysis using Global and Local Moran's I showed increased spatial clustering during the warmer months. The Bivariate Moran's I statistic indicated a weaker relationship between AMI and age during the warmer months.There are two distinct seasons with increased admissions during the colder part of the year. Males present a stronger seasonal pattern than females. There are spatial differences in AMI admissions throughout the year that cannot be explained by the age structure of the population. The seasonal difference in AMI admissions warrants further investigation. This includes detailing the prevalence of cardiac disease in the community and examining issues of social and environmental justice."mycardial	Management	"To describe treatment and outcome in all patients in a community with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in relation to gender.All patients discharged from hospital between 2001 and 2002 in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden, with a diagnosis of AMI underwent a survey to find possible gender differences. All p-values are age adjusted.Among 1423 admissions, women comprised 41% and were older than men (mean 79 versus mean 72 years). Women were admitted to a coronary care unit less frequently than men (49% versus 67%; p=0.005). Women underwent coronary angiography less frequently (21% versus 40%; p=0.02). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in 10% of the women and 18% of the men (p=0.36). Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed in 2% of the women and in 9% of the men (p<0.0001). Female gender was associated with a lower risk of reinfarction during first year after hospital discharge (12% versus 16%; p=0.003). The cumulative three-year mortality was 49% in women and 41% in men. However, when adjusting for age, admittance to CCU, coronary angiography and coronary revascularisation, risk of death during 3 years was lower in women than men (odds ratio 0.72; 95% confidence interval 0.60-0.85; p=0.0001).In the community of GÃ¶teborg women (mean age 79 years) with AMI are prioritised differently than men (mean age 72 years), prior to admission to a CCU. This results in a less invasive strategy in women, particularly with regard to CABG. When adjusting for difference in age, admittance to CCU and coronary revascularisation female gender was associated with a low risk of death during the subsequent 3 years."mycardial	Management	"Gender differences in the clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes of myocardial infarction (MI) have been demonstrated. However, few studies have examined gender differences in patients' perceptions of involvement in MI care, and whether differing levels of involvement might be associated with gender differences in treatment and outcome.To examine possible gender differences in MI patients' perceptions of their involvement during hospitalization.Questionnaire study conducted in 2005-2006 among MI patients under the age of 75 at eleven hospitals. Patient ratings of their involvement during hospitalization were analyzed for age-stratified gender differences.Younger (<70 years of age) female MI patients placed significantly more value on shared decision-making than younger (<70) men. More than one third of patients would have liked to be more involved in their care during hospitalization and discharge planning, with women significantly more dissatisfied than men. Significantly fewer younger female patients discussed secondary preventive lifestyle changes with cardiology staff prior to hospital discharge.Significant age-specific gender differences exist in MI patient ratings of, and satisfaction with, involvement during hospitalization. Further study is needed regarding the possible role of involvement in the recognized gender differences in the treatment and outcomes of MI."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Diurnal analysis of database (n=5223) on myocardial infarction in Syktyvkar for 1998-2006 has revealed the following regularities. All phase extremes of the Moon, including new moon, are accompanied in men and women by the reliable growing of the myocardial infarction number by 25-35%. ""Age"" of myocardial infarction in men is less than that in women by 10 years. This factor complies with the gender difference in the average life expectancy in the region. Men have myocardial infarction oftener than women by 1.7 times. The critical month for development of the myocardial infarction in both sexes is June."mycardial	Clinical	"Myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (MPS) is frequently used as the reference method for the determination of myocardial infarct size. PERFIT(R) is a software utilizing a three-dimensional gender specific, averaged heart model for the automatic evaluation of myocardial perfusion. The purpose of this study was to compare the perfusion defect size on MPS, assessed with PERFIT, with the hyperenhanced volume assessed by late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE) and to relate their effect on the wall motion score index (WMSI) assessed with cine magnetic resonance imaging (cine-MRI) and echocardiography (echo).LGE was performed in 40 patients where clinical MPS showed an irreversible uptake reduction suggesting a myocardial scar. Infarct volume, extent and major coronary supply were compared between MPS and LGE as well as the relationship between infarct size from both methods and WMSI.MPS showed a slightly larger infarct volume than LGE (MPS 29.6 +/- 23.2 ml, LGE 22.1 +/- 16.9 ml, p = 0.01), while no significant difference was found in infarct extent (MPS 11.7 +/- 9.4%, LGE 13.0 +/- 9.6%). The correlation coefficients between methods in respect to infarct size and infarct extent were 0.71 and 0.63 respectively. WMSI determined with cine-MRI correlated moderately with infarct volume and infarct extent (cine-MRI vs MPS volume r = 0.71, extent r = 0.71, cine-MRI vs LGE volume r = 0.62, extent r = 0.60). Similar results were achieved when wall motion was determined with echo. Both MPS and LGE showed the same major coronary supply to the infarct area in a majority of patients, Kappa = 0.84.MPS and LGE agree moderately in the determination of infarct size in both absolute and relative terms, although infarct volume is slightly larger with MPS. The correlation between WMSI and infarct size is moderate."mycardial	EPI	mycardial	Management	"TP10, a potent inhibitor of complement activation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of death and myocardial infarction (MI) in high-risk male patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, the effect of TP10 in females was undefined because of the limited number of females studied. To examine the possibility of a gender effect, this phase 2 multi-center trial was undertaken to determine whether TP10 would also limit ischemic damage in a larger sample size of high-risk females undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial involved 297 high-risk (urgent surgery, CABG + Valve, reoperations, ejection fraction <30%) female patients randomized to receive a 5 mg/kg dose of TP10 (n=150) or placebo (n=147) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion before surgery. The primary end point was the incidence of death or MI at 28 days after surgery. Complement activation was assessed by levels of CH50 and SC5b-9 during and after CPB. TP10 was well tolerated and there were no differences in the safety profiles of the 2 groups. Although TP10 effectively suppressed complement activation (at 2 hours after CPB CH50 (mean+SD % change from baseline) 50+/-17% placebo versus 4+/-14% TP10; P=0.0001; SC5b-9 (ng/mL) 917+/-1067 placebo versus 204+/-79 TP10; P=0.0001), there was no difference in the primary end point between the groups (17% placebo versus 21% TP10; P=0.2550).The benefits of TP10 appear to be gender-related. and mechanisms other than complement activation may be responsible for myocardial injury in high-risk female patients during cardiac surgery on CPB."mycardial	Epidemiology	"A relative paucity of information concerns the natural history, clinical features and coronary anatomy in young patients with acute myocardial infarction. In particular, there is a dearth of data relating to sex differences in young patients. The objective was to evaluate whether or not there are correlations between the clinical characteristics and the extent and localization of coronary artery lesions in young men compared with young women. The study population consisted of 1646 young patients (87% men, 13% women; mean age 39+/-5 years) with a first acute myocardial infarction admitted to one of the 125 coronary care units of Italy in a period of 3 years. Clinical data were collected. All patients underwent coronary angiography during hospitalization. Smoking, hypercholesterolemia and obesity were significantly more prevalent in men than in women; physical inactivity was significantly more prevalent among women. Hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis occurred in 82% of patients and were more frequent in men than in women (P<0.05). Women more frequently had single-vessel disease and no coronary lesions at all (58 vs. 47% and 24 vs. 9% women vs. men respectively, both P<0.05). Men more frequently had multivessel disease (38 vs. 13%, P<0.05). Significant stenosis mainly affected the left anterior descending artery (52%) with no gender-related difference; men more likely had lesions of the left circumflex or right coronary artery (P<0.05). In conclusion, young patients with a first acute myocardial infarction risk factors profile and extent of coronary artery lesions were significantly different between sexes."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"There is conflicting information about whether mortality after AMI is higher in women than men. We investigated the significance of plasma adiponectin concentrations on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to delineate any differences between men and women. The study patients consisted of 114 men and 42 women with AMI. The incidence of MACE was significantly higher in women than men during the entire follow-up period (p<0.05). Compared with men for post-AMI MACE, the hazard ratio for women was 5.6 after adjustment for prognostic factors. Killip class (p<0.001) and sex differences (p<0.05) were independent predictors of MACE at 1 year post-AMI. Plasma adiponectin levels in women were significantly higher than men on admission (8.66 microg/mL [range: 6.6-14.08] versus 4.71 microg/mL [range: 3.47-7.27], p<0.0001) and during the post-AMI course (all p<0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified plasma adiponectin level on admission as an independent predictor of MACE in men (p<0.001) and the difference between plasma adiponectin levels at discharge and on admission in women (p<0.05). Patterns of serial changes in plasma adiponectin concentrations are different between men and women and plasma adiponectin concentrations can be used to predict future adverse cardiac events in AMI patients."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"It is well established that premenopausal women are protected from cardiovascular disease. This gender difference in favor of females is also demonstrated in animal studies. Our research group previously found that female mice had much lower incidence of cardiac rupture and mortality than did males during the acute phase of myocardial infarction (MI); however, the mechanisms responsible for such protection are not fully understood.The aim of this study was to determine whether the favorable cardiac effect observed in female mice with MI is due to an augmented healing process that includes less inflammation, reduced matrix degradation, and enhanced neovascularization.Twelve-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to MI by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery and then euthanized at 1, 4, 7, or 14 days post-MI. Inflammatory cell infiltration and myofibroblast transformation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activity, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-I expression, and neovascularization were examined by immunohistochemistry, zymography, Western blot, and laser scanning confocal microscopy, respectively. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography on day 14.We found that: (1) neutrophil infiltration during the early phase of MI (1-4 days) was much lower in females than in males and was associated with lower MMP-9 activity and higher TIMP-1 protein expression, indicating less-exaggerated inflammation and extracellular matrix degradation in females; (2) myofibroblast transformation, as indicated by expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, was significantly greater in females than in males at day 7 of MI (P<0.05), indicating facilitated collagen deposition and scar formation; and (3) neovascularization (vascular area in the infarct border) was markedly increased in females, and was associated with better preserved cardiac function and less left ventricular dilatation.Our data suggest that less-exaggerated early inflammation and augmented reparative fibrotic response, indicated by enhanced myofibroblast transformation, may contribute greatly to low rupture rates in females during the acute and subacute phases of MI, whereas enhanced neovascularization may lead to better preserved cardiac function post-MI."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To examine gender-specific associations between sleep duration and sleep complaints and incident myocardial infarction (MI).Cohort study.A representative population sample of middle-aged subjects in Germany.The study was based on 3508 men and 3388 women (aged 45 to 74 years) who participated in one of the 3 MONICA (Monitoring trends and determinants on cardiovascular diseases) Augsburg surveys between 1984 and 1995, who were free of MI and angina pectoris at baseline and were followed up until 2002.N/A.A total of 295 cases of incident MI among men and 85 among women occurred during a mean follow-up period of 10.1 years. Compared with women sleeping 8 hours, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of MI among women sleeping < or =5 hours was 2.98 (95% CI, 1.48-6.03), and among women sleeping > or =9 hours 1.40 (95% CI, 0.74-2.64); the corresponding HRs among men were 1.13 (95% CI, 0.66-1.92) and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.75-1.53). In multivariable analysis the relative risk of an incident MI for men and women with difficulties maintaining sleep was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.84-1.48) and 1.53 (95% CI, 0.99-2.37), respectively, and for men and women with difficulties initiating sleep the relative risk was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.82-1.63) and 1.30 (95% CI, 0.81-2.06), respectively.Modest associations between short sleep duration and difficulties maintaining sleep and incident MI were seen in middle-aged women but not men from the general population."mycardial	Clinical	"Recognizing symptoms as cardiac in origin is associated with the prompt seeking of medical care in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Therefore, the authors compared the symptom attribution of men and women experiencing AMI and examined factors associated with cardiac attribution by sex. In a cross-sectional study, a total of 1059 AMI patients were consecutively recruited across 5 countries. A structured interview was performed during hospitalization. Approximately 40% of both men and women interpreted their symptoms as cardiac in origin. In men, a history of coronary heart disease (CHD) and chest pain severity were significantly associated with symptom interpretation as cardiac in origin (odds ratio [OR], 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-5.6; OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.7, respectively). In women, a history of CHD was also significantly associated with symptom interpretation as cardiac in origin (OR, 4.95; 95% CI, 2.39-10.25), but not severity of chest pain. As opposed to men, severe chest pain may not be a cue for women to interpret their symptom as cardiac in origin. Education and counseling must take sex differences into account to be effective."mycardial	Review	"Although cardiovascular mortality for men has been declining, the number of women dying from cardiovascular disease has slightly increased. Differences between women and men have been identified throughout the entire spectrum of ischemic heart disease, from risk factors to presentation and from diagnosis to treatment and outcomes. In the setting of an acute coronary syndrome or acute myocardial infarction, women are significantly more likely than men to report multiple non-chest pain symptoms, including dyspnea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, neck pain, and jaw pain. Investigations into the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease in women have broken away from the traditional thinking that coronary artery disease simply equals epicardial stenosis. In women, the new paradigm of coronary artery disease also focuses on diffuse atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and microvascular disease. Further research focusing on sex differences in cardiovascular disease is needed, but enough is currently known to offer a sex-based approach, which may ultimately lead to improved outcomes."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To identify gender differences in delay time and the reasons why African Americans delay in seeking medical care for symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Cross-sectional.Five hospitals in the San Francisco and East Bay areas.Sixty-one African American men and women diagnosed with an AMI.Prehospital delay time.Median delay time was longer for women compared to men (4.4 hours vs 3.5 hours), although the difference was not significant. Single women delayed longer than single men (P = .03), and women who were alone when symptoms began delayed longer than women with someone (P = .03). Women who received advice to seek help or call 911 upon symptom onset had shorter delays compared to women who were not advised to call 911 (P = .01). Men at home delayed longer than men who experienced their symptoms outside the home (P = .01). Men with emergency room insurance delayed longer than men without emergency room insurance (P = .03), and men who took an ambulance to the hospital had shorter delay times than men who took other means of transportation (P = .04).Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI."mycardial	Epidemiology	"The authors sought to determine the profile of traditional risk factors and hematologic-metabolic parameters as well as relative risk among patients with myocardial infarction (MI). This study included 594 MI patients (70.2% men and 29.8% women) and was carried out during a period of 11 years from 1994 to 2005. Patients were analyzed by sex according to selected hematologic-metabolic parameters and risk factors. The mean age, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, total cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose were significantly different (P<.05) between men and women. The mean hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in men with hyperlipidemia (HLP) and family history of MI compared with those without these risk factors were significantly different (P<.05). Relative risks of HLP, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN) for women were higher than for men in all age groups. The relative risk was 6.16 times higher for women with the 3-factor HLP, DM, and HTN combination. The results of this study confirm the important role of HLP, DM, and HTN in the occurrence of MI, especially in women."mycardial	Management	"Previous studies of sex differences in the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) predate recent expansions in Medicare coverage and did not provide patient follow-up over multiple years.To examine sex differences in ICD use for primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death.Analysis of a 5% national sample of research-identifiable files obtained from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the period 1991 through 2005. Patients were those aged 65 years or older with Medicare fee-for-service coverage and diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction and either heart failure or cardiomyopathy but no prior cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia (ie, the primary prevention cohort [n = 65,917 men and 70,504 women]), or with cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia (ie, the secondary prevention cohort [n = 52,252 men and 47,411 women]), from 1999 through 2005.Receipt of ICD therapy and all-cause mortality at 1 year.In the 2005 primary prevention cohort, 32.3 per 1000 men and 8.6 per 1000 women received ICD therapy within 1 year of cohort entry. In multivariate analyses, men were more likely than women to receive ICD therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.86-3.47). Among men and women alive at 180 days after cohort entry, the hazard of mortality in the subsequent year was not significantly lower among those who received ICD therapy (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.82-1.23). In the 2005 secondary prevention cohort, 102.2 per 1000 men and 38.4 per 1000 women received ICD therapy. Controlling for demographic variables and comorbid conditions, men were more likely than women to receive ICD therapy (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 2.30-2.59). Among men and women alive at 30 days after cohort entry, the hazard of mortality in the subsequent year was significantly lower among those who received ICD therapy (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.60-0.71).In the Medicare population, women are significantly less likely than men to receive ICD therapy for primary or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death."mycardial	Management	"Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in men as well as in women. Women have their first cardiac event 6 to 10 years later than men do. Whereas, the cardiovascular death rates are declining in men, they remain constant in women. In cardiovascular studies with age limits, women are naturally the minority, amounting to < 40%.Determine the effect of gender on treatment and clinical outcomes in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients.This is a multicenter study including 13 government and 4 private institutions. Between August 1, 2002 and October 31, 2005, 3,836 consecutive patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction were enrolled. The patient characteristics, treatment, and hospital outcome were collected and validated. In-hospital management and outcomes were compared between men and women, without adjustment, with adjustment for age alone and with adjustment for age and other covariates by means of multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. In each model tested, gender was forced into the model, whereas other predictors were selected in a stepwise mannerWomen were 1,223 patients (31.9%) of all patients and were 8 years older than men (67.5 +/- 12.0 vs. 59.7 +/- 12.4 years). Women had a higher incidence of diabetes and hypertension (46.9% vs. 31.0%, p < 0.001 and 62.1% vs. 45.3%, p < 0.001). Smoking and family risk factor were found in men more than in women (17.5% vs. 52.5%, p < 0.001 and 7.4% vs. 11.2%, p< 0.001). Women presented more frequently with cardiac dyspnea and shock than men (35.3% vs. 22.2%, p < 0.001 and 21.5% vs. 13.8%, p < 0.001). There was no difference in time to admission between men and women. Beta blocker, statin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor inhibitor (ARB) were less frequently used in women. Coronary angiogram was performed less often in women and less abnormal angiogram were found (57.8% vs. 65.0%, p < 0.001 and 55.5% vs. 63.9%, p < 0.001). A lower percentage of women received thrombolytic therapy (28.1% vs. 31.4%, p = 0.039) as well as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (39.0% vs. 48.5%, p < 0.001).Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in women than in men (23.6% vs. 13.9%, unadjusted OR (95% CI) 1.90 (1.60-2.26), p < 0.001). After adjustment of other covariables (age group> 75 years, hospital group (metropolitan, regional), chest pain, cardiac dyspnea, shock, post cardiac arrest, diabetes, hypertension, family history, smoking, dyslipidemia, refer time to admission < or = 12 hours (hour), aspirin, beta blocker calcium antagonist, statin, ACEI, ARB, nitrate, coronary angiogram, thrombolysis, PCI, coronary artery bypass grafting, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke, bleeding), the gender difference in-hospital mortality no longer existed (adjusted OR (95% CI) 1.03 (0.80-1.33), p = 0.814). The incidence of congestive heart failure as a complication was significantly higher in women than in men (55.6% vs. 38.7%, p < 0.001, adjusted OR (95% CI) 1.29 (1.08-1.54), p = 0.005).Women with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction were older and had a higher incidence of hypertension and diabetes than men. Women were less likely than men to undergo coronary angioplasty. Women in the authors' registry had a higher risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality than men. Early and aggressive treatment might improve the clinical outcomes in women with STEMI."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Cardiac rupture remains a fatal complication of acute myocardial infarction (MI) with its mechanism partially understood. We hypothesized that damage to the collagen matrix of infarcted myocardium is the central mechanism of rupture and therefore responsible for the difference in the incidence of rupture between genders. We examined left ventricular (LV) remodeling during the acute phase post-MI in 129sv mice. Following induction of MI, we monitored rupture events and assessed the extent of LV remodeling by echocardiography. Muscle tensile strength, content of insoluble and soluble collagen, expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and density of inflammatory cells were determined in the infarcted and non-infarcted myocardium. We then tested the effects of MMP inhibition on rupture. Compared to female mice, males with MI displayed greater extent of LV remodeling, reduced muscle tensile strength, loss of insoluble collagen, local inflammatory response and MMP-9 activation, changes associated with a 3 times higher incidence of rupture than in females. MMP-9 expression by circulating blood mononuclear cells was also increased in male mice with acute MI. Treatment of male mice with an MMP inhibitor reduced MMP activity and halved rupture incidence. Our findings demonstrate that the differences in the severity of inflammation, MMP activation and damage to collagen matrix account for gender difference in cardiac rupture. Our study illustrates the breakdown of fibril collagen as a central mechanism of cardiac rupture."mycardial	Management	"To study gender differences in management and outcome in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome.Cohort study of 53 781 consecutive patients (37% women) from the Register of Information and Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive care Admissions (RIKS-HIA), with a diagnosis of either unstable angina pectoris or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All patients were admitted to intensive coronary care units in Sweden, between 1998 and 2002, and followed for 1 year.Treatment intensity and in-hospital, 30-day and 1-year mortality.Women were older (73 vs 69 years, p<0.001) and more likely to have a history of hypertension and diabetes, but less likely to have a history of myocardial infarction or revascularisation. After adjustment, there were no major differences in acute pharmacological treatment or prophylactic medication at discharge. Revascularisation was, however, even after adjustment, performed more often in men (OR 1.15; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.21). After adjustment, there was no significant difference in in-hospital (OR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.13) or 30-days (OR 1.07; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.15) mortality, but at 1 year being male was associated with higher mortality (OR 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.19).Although women are somewhat less intensively treated, especially regarding invasive procedures, after adjustment for differences in background characteristics, they have better long-term outcomes than men."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Aspirin therapy is a cornerstone in the prevention of atherothrombotic events, but recurrent vascular events are estimated to occur in 8-18% of patients taking aspirin for secondary prevention after 2 years. Estimates of biologic aspirin resistance vary from 5% to 60%, depending on the assay used. However, the relationship between biologic measurements of aspirin resistance and adverse clinical events remains unclear.To determine whether patients with documented myocardial infarction (MI) while on aspirin therapy (cases) were more likely to be aspirin resistant than were patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who had no history of MI (controls) and to assess clinical predictors of aspirin resistance in patients with stable CAD.This case-control study examined aspirin responses using the VerifyNow Aspirin Assay system in 50 cases and 50 controls who had taken a dose of aspirin within 48 hours of presentation to the clinic visit. Odds ratios were estimated to determine the association between aspirin resistance and MI. Independent predictors of aspirin resistance were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses.An increase in the prevalence of aspirin resistance among cases (16% vs 12% in controls) was not observed (OR 1.40; 95% CI 0.45 to 4.37; p = 0.566). In the overall CAD population, female sex was independently associated with aspirin resistance (OR 4.01; 95% CI 1.15 to 13.92; p = 0.029).Additional large studies are required to understand whether biologically defined aspirin resistance is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events, with special attention paid to sex differences."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"In men, high adiponectin concentrations were related to a lower risk of myocardial infarction, whereas no association with cardiovascular events was found in women.To investigate sex differences in the associations of adiponectin with cardiovascular risk factors.Cross-sectional population-based KORA Survey 2000 in Southern Germany using the same study methods for cardiovascular risk factors as the former WHO MONICA project.A total of 697 men and 657 women, aged 55-74 years. Glucose tolerance status was assessed by oral glucose tolerance tests.Adiponectin (geometric mean, interquartile range; microg/ml) levels were significantly higher in women (11.1; 8.5-14.9) than in men (7.1; 5.2-9.6) (P<0.05). In univariate analyses, HDL-cholesterol and age were significantly positively correlated with adiponectin in both sexes. Negative correlations were observed with BMI, waist circumference, fasting and postchallenge glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1c, triglycerides, uric acid and CRP (P<0.01). In sex-specific multivariate regression, age and HDL-cholesterol were independently positively, and fasting insulin and 2-h glucose were negatively related to adiponectin in both sexes. Uric acid was significantly inversely related to adiponectin in women only (sex interaction: P=0.02). Exploratory sex-specific factor analysis of adiponectin and the core components of the metabolic syndrome yielded four similar factors. Adiponectin loaded negatively on the 'lipids' factor in both sexes.The associations of adiponectin with cardiovascular risk factors showed a similar pattern in both sexes, except for uric acid. This small sex difference may not explain previous conflicting results on the association of adiponectin with cardiovascular events in men and women."mycardial	Review	"To determine the impact of statin therapy on the combined endpoint of cardiovascular events in women and men separately.A systematic literature search through May 2006 was conducted to identify randomized, controlled statin trials evaluating the gender specific incidence of cardiovascular events. Weighted averages were reported as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated via random-effects model.The primary outcome measured was a composite endpoint of all cardiovascular events. Secondary outcomes measured included death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke.Fifteen trials were included in this meta-analysis. Cardiovascular events were reduced in men (RR 0.76 [95% CI 0.70, 0.81]) and women (RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.69, 0.90]). Reductions in mortality, MI, and stroke predominantly contributed to the reduction in cardiovascular events in men taking statins. Women did not have a reduction in mortality or stroke, suggesting that the reductions in cardiac events may have been predominantly due to reductions in need for revascularization and/or unstable angina.Statins reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in men and women, but women on statins may not have reductions in mortality and stroke like their male counterparts."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"The study was designed to investigate the effect of progesterone and its gender based variation on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Adult Sprague Dawley rats were divided into vehicle treated reperfusion injury group male (I/R-M), female (I/R-F), ovariectomised (I/R-OVR) and progesterone treatment (I/R-M+PG, I/R-F+PG, I/R-OVR+PG) groups, respectively. I/R injury was produced by occluding the left descending coronary artery (LCA) for 1 h and followed by re-opening for 1 h. Progesterone (2 mg kg(-1) i.p.) was administered 30 min after induction of ischemia. Hemodynamic parameters (+/-dp/dt, MAP), heart rate, ST-segment elevation and occurrence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) were measured during the I/R period. The myocardial infarct area, oxidative stress markers, activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and creatine kinase (CK) were determined after the experiment along with the assessment of the effect on apoptotic activity by using DNA fragmentation analysis. Histological observations were carried out on heart tissue. Treatment with progesterone significantly (P<0.05) reduced infarct area, lipid peroxidation (LPO) level and activity of MPO in females (I/R-F+PG) as compared to ischemic females (I/R-F). Progesterone significantly (P<0.001, P<0.05) inhibited serum CK activity and incidences of VT in female rats. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly elevated (P<0.05) in I/R-F+PG group. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was less in I/R-F+PG group when compared to I/R-F group. The ischemic male and ovariectomised (I/R-M and I/R-OVR) counterparts did not show any significant change after progesterone treatment. In conclusion, the cardioprotective effect of progesterone on myocardial I/R injury induced damage is based on gender of the animal. The protective effect could be mediated by attenuation of inflammation and its possible interaction with endogenous estrogen."mycardial	Management	"Although sex-related differences in early outcomes have been observed in young women following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and coronary bypass surgery, evidence for similar differences following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is lacking.Using the 1999 to 2002 New York State PCI reporting system, we identified 11,162 men and 2,561 women aged 50 years or younger undergoing a first PCI procedure. In-hospital outcomes were compared by gender after multivariable adjustment for baseline, clinical and procedural characteristics.Young women undergoing an initial PCI procedure were more likely to belong to racial or ethnic minorities and exhibit more comorbidities than young men. However, they had better ejection fraction (52.9% +/- 11.3 vs. 51.9 +/- 11; p = 0.0002) and presented more often with single-vessel disease (75% vs. 67%; p < 0.0001). Despite women receiving glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (58.6% vs. 65.1%; p < 0.0001) and stents (92.5% vs. 94.9%; p < 0.0001) less often, procedural success was achieved equally (97% vs. 96%). Young women experienced higher rates of in-hospital mortality (0.70% vs. 0.22%; p < 0.0001), and vascular damage (0.82% vs. 0.24%; p < 0.0001) compared to men. In multivariable analysis, female sex independently predicted in-hospital mortality (OR 4.0, 95% CI: 1.9 to 8.1) after adjustment for urgency of PCI, clinical and procedural characteristics.A gender-based difference in early survival exists in young women undergoing a first PCI procedure. Further investigation into the mechanism of this higher risk is warranted."mycardial	Outcomes	"Several studies report that women with CAD have a poorer prognosis than men and suggest that depressive symptoms may be a contributing factor. The purpose of this study was to examine gender differences in depressive symptoms, as they relate to health-related quality of life outcomes following an AMI.Patients with documented AMI completed a questionnaire including the Short Form 36 physical (PCS), and mental component summary (MCS) scores, and Beck Depression Inventory at baseline and at 1 year after AMI admission.486 (82%) patients completed the follow-up questionnaire. Females had significantly worse PCS and MCS scores at baseline and 1-year follow-up compared to males The mean 1-year Beck scores were significantly higher (p=0.01) for females (10.02+/-8.23) compared to males (7.78+/-8.01) indicating more reported depressive symptomatology. Multivariate analyses showed significant gender-related differences in the PCS scores at 1 year, but no gender-related differences in the 1-year MCS scores.These results suggest that gender differences in mental health at 1 year relate to gender-related differences at 1-year depression levels. The higher level of depression in women may be a consequence of gender differences in recovery patterns from an AMI and requires further investigation."mycardial	Outcomes	"Although much attention has been given to survival after myocardial infarction (MI), little is known about sex differences in health status (symptoms, function, and quality of life). A particularly critical moment to assess health status following an MI is early after discharge when patients have resumed routine activities and when additional treatments may be offered to those with residual angina or quality of life limitations.We used multivariable Poisson and linear regression models to examine differences in 30-day health status by sex in a cohort of 2096 MI patients enrolled in a 19-center Prospective Registry Evaluating Myocardial Infarction: Events and Recovery (PREMIER).Women (32% of the cohort) were older and less likely to be white, married, or treated with coronary revascularization. They were more likely to have had a non-ST segment elevation MI, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, chronic lung disease, and worse health status at admission. Risk-adjusted multivariable models suggest women were slightly more likely to have angina (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.0, 1.14, p = 0.06), worse quality of life (difference in SAQ score = -4.36 points, 95% CI -5.44, -3.27 points, p = <0.001) and poorer physical functioning (difference in SF-12 PCS = -2.55 points, 95%CI = -3.62, -1.48 points, p = <0.001) at 30 days than men.One in four patients experienced angina 1 month after their MI, and women had a slightly greater prevalence than men. The physical function and quality of life of women 30 days after an MI is similar to or worse than that of men."mycardial	Management	"We sought to investigate the sex differences in the effectiveness of statins in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Linking hospital discharge and drug claims databases from Quebec, Canada (1998-2004), we identified statin users (n = 14 710) and non-users (n = 23 833) discharged from hospital after an AMI-related hospital stay and followed up for as long as 7 years.All-cause death rates were 4.1 and 14.6 per 100 person-years among users and non-users, respectively, whereas cardiac death rates were 2.2 and 7.4 per 100 person-years. For death from any cause, the adjusted hazard ratios associated with statin use in women were 0.61 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.69) within 1 year of follow-up, 0.55 (0.48-0.63) at 1-3 years and 0.38 (0.31-0.49) at > 3 years; in men, the corresponding estimates were 0.54 (0.48-0.60), 0.48 (0.42-0.55) and 0.34 (0.30-0.39). For cardiac-related death, the adjusted hazard ratios associated with statin use in women were 0.70 (0.60-0.81) within 1 year, 0.56 (0.46-0.68) at 1-3 years and 0.44 (0.31-0.62) at > 3 years of follow-up, whereas in men, the estimates were 0.59 (0.51-0.69), 0.47 (0.39-0.58) and 0.37 (0.30-0.45), respectively.Statin therapy after an AMI was associated with reduced rates of all-cause and cardiac mortality. The effect increased with time in both sexes, but the degree of risk reduction was less for women than for men."mycardial	Clinical	"Craniofacial pain can be the only symptom of cardiac ischemia. Failure to recognize its cardiac source can put the patient's life at risk. The authors conducted a study to reveal the prevalence of, the distribution of and sex differences regarding craniofacial pain of cardiac origin.The authors prospectively selected consecutive patients (N = 186) who had had a verified cardiac ischemic episode. They studied the location and distribution of craniofacial and intraoral pain in detail.Craniofacial pain was the only complaint during the ischemic episode in 11 patients (6 percent), three of them who had acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Another 60 patients (32 percent) reported craniofacial pain concomitant with pain in other regions. The most common craniofacial pain locations were the throat, left mandible, right mandible, left temporomandibular joint/ear region and teeth. Craniofacial pain was pre-ponderantly manifested in female subjects (P = .031) and was the dominating symptom in both sexes in the absence of chest pain.Craniofacial pain commonly is induced by cardiac ischemia. This must be considered in differential diagnosis of toothache and orofacial pain.Because patients who have AMI without chest pain run a higher risk of experiencing a missed diagnosis and death, the dentist's awareness of this symptomatology can be crucial for early diagnosis and timely treatment."mycardial	Management	"Women with acute myocardial infarction have a higher hospital mortality rate than men. This difference has been ascribed to their older age, more frequent comorbidities, and less frequent use of revascularization. The aim of this study is to assess these factors in relation to excess mortality in women.All hospital admissions in France with a discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction were extracted from the national payment database. Logistic regression on mortality was performed for age, comorbidities, and coronary interventions. Nonparametric microsimulation models estimated the percutaneous coronary intervention and mortality rates that women would experience if they were ""treated like men."" Data were analyzed from 74,389 patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction, 30.0% of whom were women. Women were older (75 versus 63 years of age; P<0.001) and had a higher rate of hospital mortality (14.8% versus 6.1%; P<0.0001) than men. Percutaneous coronary interventions were more frequent in men (7.4% versus 4.8%; 24.4% versus 14.2% with stent; P<0.001). Mortality adjusted for age and comorbidities was higher in women (P<0.001), with an excess adjusted absolute mortality of 1.95%. Simulation models related 0.46% of this excess to reduced use of procedures. Survival benefit related to percutaneous coronary intervention was lower among women.The difference in mortality rate between men and women with acute myocardial infarction is due largely to the different age structure of these populations. However, age-adjusted hospital mortality was higher for women and was associated with a lower rate of percutaneous coronary intervention. Simulations suggest that women would derive benefit from more frequent use of percutaneous coronary intervention, although these procedures appear less protective in women than in men."mycardial	Outcomes	"There is limited evidence whether women benefit to the same degree as men from treatment of myocardial infarction with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when compared to fibrinolysis. This study compares health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes for men and women randomized to primary PCI and fibrinolysis.A questionnaire-based study in 1351 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), assessed at 1 and 12 months after the infarction.HRQoL was measured with the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Rose's angina and dyspnoea questionnaire and global QoL questions.Women had a worse score than men on all endpoints at 1 month and at several endpoints at 12 months. In analyses of gender differences in benefits of PCI 1 month after the STEMI, significant gender differences were found in the SF-36 mental component summary scale, with men having better scores after primary PCI and women having better scores after fibrinolysis (P=0.03). At 12 months, similar gender differences in treatment benefit were found in the SF-36 scales for general health (P=0.01), mental health (P<0.01), and the mental component summary scale (P=0.01), as well as in the scales for anxiety (P=0.04), depression (P=0.02), and global quality of life (P<0.01); men had better scores after primary-PCI and women had better scores after fibrinolysis.Compared to fibrinolysis treatment in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, women do not seem to benefit from primary PCI to the same degree as men. Since previous studies have found no gender differences in clinical outcomes, this result may be specific to HRQoL."mycardial	Epidemiology	"In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the delay between the onset of symptoms and hospital admission is a critical factor in reducing morbidity and mortality.To assess gender differences in prehospital delay among women and men with first time AMI, generate more knowledge about aspects influencing this delay and investigate responses to acute symptoms.Of 738 eligible patients, 149 women and 384 men responded to a questionnaire (72%). Over half of both women and men waited over one hour before they called for medical assistance and more than half the patients had a total prehospital delay exceeding two hours. Rapid development of symptoms and symptoms matching expectations reduced, self medication and consulting the spouse increased patient delay in both genders. Calling the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) reduced and calling a general practitioner increased total prehospital delay in both genders. ST-ELEVATION: (STEMI), symptoms experienced as unbearable and attributed as cardiac reduced patient delay, and symptoms from the back, shoulders or between scapulae increased prehospital delay, only in men.How patients responded to symptoms had vital impact on prehospital delay among both genders, but the experience and interpretation of symptoms had more influence in men than in women."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To explore risk factors for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality in hypertensive patients treated in primary care.Community-based cohort study.Hypertension outpatient clinic in primary health care.Patients who consecutively underwent an annual follow-up during 1992-1993 (n =894; 377 men and 517 women).All events of fatal AMI were ascertained by record linkage to the National Mortality Register to December 31, 2002. Gender-specific predictors for AMI mortality were analysed by Cox regression.AMI mortality.During a mean follow-up of 8.7 years 32 cases (8.5%) of fatal AMI were observed in men and 31 cases (6.0%) were observed in women. Most important predictors for AMI mortality in men were microalbuminuria (HR 3.8, CI 1.8-8.0) and left ventricular hypertrophy (HR 4.0, CI 1.7-9.4), whilst in women type 2 diabetes (HR 4.8, CI 2.4-9.8) was an important predictor. In hypertensive patients without diabetes male gender was associated with high AMI mortality (HR 2.7, CI 1.4-5.3), but in patients with both hypertension and type 2 diabetes the higher risk in men disappeared (HR 0.8, CI 0.4-1.7).Cardiovascular disease risk factors remain strong predictors of AMI mortality in hypertensive patients but with a different pattern in the two genders. Markers of organ damage are more important predictors in men, whereas markers of impaired glucose metabolism are more important predictors in women."mycardial	Management	"The study objectives were to assess any gender differences in the application of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and their impact on outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Prospective cohort study of patients in the PRIAMHO II registry. 58 randomly selected public hospitals in Spain included 6209 patients with AMI admitted to Coronary/Critical Care Unit from May 15 to December 15 2000 with 1-year follow-up. Data were gathered on use of coronary angiography and reperfusion procedures, on a combined outcome variable (including death, reinfarction, postinfarction angina, and stroke during hospital stay), and on 28-day and 1-year mortality rates.4641 (74.75%) of the patients were male and 1568 (25.5%) female. No gender differences in coronary angiography or reperfusion therapy use were found. However, female sex alongside age, use of reperfusion therapy, diabetes mellitus, previous revascularization, previous AMI, and higher Killip class were predictors of the combined outcome variable, with an adjusted OR of 1.21 (CI 95% 1.02-1.42).No association was observed between the gender of patients with AMI and the application of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. Nevertheless, female sex behaved as an independent adverse short-term prognostic factor."mycardial	Management	"It is a matter of concern that women have higher in-hospital mortality rates than men with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), however, it is not yet clear whether significant gender differences exist. We studied the influence of gender on the characteristics and in-hospital mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).We used data from 15 acute care hospitals included in the sample from the Tokai Acute Myocardial Infarction Study II (TAMIS-II), a prospective study of all patients admitted to these hospitals from 2001 to 2003 with a diagnosis of AMI. We abstracted the baseline and procedural characteristics from detailed chart reviews which included not only physician notes but also nursing notes, and a questionnaire which included baseline characteristics, procedural course and in-hospital mortality. Multivariate analysis was performed, controlling for age and other variables which were found to be significantly different between men and women by chi-square test or unpaired t test.A total of 566 women and 2,048 men were included in the present study.There were gender differences in age, comorbid conditions, smoking status, body mass index, activities of daily livings, heart failure on presentation, duration of stay, angiographic data, transfer to ICU/CCU, and thrombolytic drugs. In univariate analysis, women had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than did men; however, this gender difference disappeared after adjustment for age and other variables.Our study demonstrated that women with AMI who undergo PCI do not have a higher in-hospital mortality rate than men."mycardial	Outcomes	"Heart failure (HF) is associated with poor outcome after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Women have higher mortality rate than men after AMI, however, it is unknown whether women with HF after AMI have different prognosis than men.To compare the prognosis of men and women with AMI and mild-moderate HF.We analyzed data of 3456 consecutive patients with AMI hospitalized in all cardiac care units in Israel during two nationwide surveys.Among patients with AMI and HF on admission: women were older, had more risk factors, and were less likely to undergo percutaneous coronary angiography/intervention. Women with HF had higher (7-days, 30-days, and 1-year) crude mortality rates than men. However, adjusted mortality rates were not significantly different between genders.Women with AMI complicated by HF had higher crude mortality rate than men that was eliminated after multivariate analysis, suggesting that the higher mortality rate may be attributed to increased prevalence of risk factors and lower rate of revascularization and medical therapies among women. Women with AMI and HF should be considered as a high-risk subgroup with adverse outcome. It remains to be determined whether more intensive management will improve their prognosis."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Because occupational classification systems tend to be less precise in the female sector of the working market there has been concern that this might imply more misclassification of socioeconomic position among women, biasing comparisons of gender-specific socioeconomic differences in risk.The Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program (SHEEP) is a population-based case-control study of risk factors for incident myocardial infarction. The study base included all Swedish citizens aged 45-70 in Stockholm County during 1992-94, 550 female and 1201 male cases, and 776 female and 1538 male controls. The use of an occupational classification as the base for categorizing socioeconomic position was compared with socioeconomic position based on detailed self-reported information on job titles and work tasks.Women are categorized into fewer occupational categories than men and the socioeconomic heterogeneity within occupational categories is substantial for women as has been reported by others. However, despite more occupational categories for male types of jobs the socioeconomic heterogeneity within occupational categories is actually larger for men, implying larger misclassification among men. In simulations with different levels of socioeconomic misclassification among women, the effects on the gender comparison of socioeconomic differences in disease risk were small and they were mostly compensated for by less misclassification among men.The findings do not support the assumption that misclassification of socioeconomic position among women due to a restricted working market and a crude occupational classification for female jobs is an important issue when comparing measures of socioeconomic inequalities in health between men and women."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Mortality in women following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is higher than in men, in that women are older and have more co-morbidity at the time of AMI. We evaluated short- and long-term sex-related differences in management and prognosis among high-risk patients following AMI.A total of 1575 women and 3902 men with AMI and heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or anterior Q waves, were recruited for participation in the OPTIMAAL trial and followed for 2.7+/-0.9 years in seven European countries. Symptomatic heart failure was more common in women when compared with men. Women were older, with more hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Fewer women were treated with thrombolytics (P<0.001 in all cases). Women had a 1.37-fold higher risks of death (P<0.001) during follow-up, but no differences were observed after adjusting for age. However, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in women (4.89 vs. 2.54%; P<0.001) and a 1.57-fold higher risk of in-hospital death (P=0.006) persisted after adjusting for age and co-morbidities.Among high-risk patients with AMI, age-adjusted long-term survival was similar between sexes. However, adjusted in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in women. Higher short-term risk may warrant more rapid and appropriate management of women with AMI."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Case-control studies have successfully identified many genetic associations for complex diseases but suffer from lack of reproducibility in the same population. Demonstrating weak genetic effect requires large sample sizes to minimize statistical bias. Based on a study examining 500 myocardial infarction (MI) patients and 500 controls from the genetically isolated Newfoundland population, we previously reported that thrombospondin-4 (THBS-4) 1186G>C variant associates with MI in women. To validate this sex-dependent association with the THBS-4 variant, we analyzed an additional 532 patients and 514 controls from the same population and the combined cohort consisting of 1032 patients and 1014 controls.Genotyping of THBS-4 1186G>C was conducted using Taq Man 1186G>C (A3879P) (rs 1866389) genotyping technology on real-time polymerase chain reaction.The genotype distributions of THBS-4 1186G>C in the validation and combined cohorts were similar with those in our initial study, which supports genetic homogeneity in the studied population. The association of the CC genotype with MI in women (odds ratio [OR], 2.96; P = .008) reported in our initial cohort failed to achieve statistical significance in our validation cohort (OR, 1.53; P = .307) but was confirmed in the combined cohort (OR, 2.14; P = .009). In contrast to the results from the initial cohort was a significant association of the CC genotype with later onset MI in the validation (OR, 2.37; P = .029) and combined cohorts (OR, 2.22; P = .011). Moreover, the larger studied population gave statistical power to associate the CC genotype with risk of MI in the total patient population (OR, 1.58; P = .023).Homozygosity for the THBS-4 1186C variant is a weak risk factor for MI especially in older women."mycardial	Clinical	"The purpose of this study was to compare symptom presentation and illness behavior among women and men with acute myocardial infarction and assess various aspects that influence prehospital delay. This is a cross-sectional, retrospective study using self-reported questionnaires. The sample consisted of 82 women and men in Norway, up to 65 years of age, with first-time acute myocardial infarction between March and October 1999. The findings demonstrated that the most commonly reported symptom in both genders was chest pain. More than 90% of women and men experienced chest pain, with no difference between the genders. More women than men had nausea as well as pain located in their arms, back, jaw, and throat. More men than women attributed their symptoms to be cardiac in origin. Experiencing pain in the shoulders, attributing symptoms to be noncardiac, consulting a family member, and contacting several medical practitioners increased prehospital delay. During the year before the event, women were more likely to experience fatigue than men. The conclusion of this study is that women experienced a greater diversity of symptoms than men. Acute symptoms, interpretation of symptoms, and illness behavior may influence prehospital delay."mycardial	Epidemiology	"A retrospective review of data was conducted to determine whether disparities in cardiovascular disease treatment occurred in three public teaching hospitals in Louisiana when patients presented for care with ischemic heart disease (IHD) or acute myocardial infarction (MI). Multinomial logit models were used to estimate the adjusted odds in the utilization of invasive procedures, while controlling for confounders (i.e., age, marital status, comorbidities, payer type, diabetes, and cigarette addiction) simultaneously. No significant racial disparities were found for cardiac catheterization (CC) or Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA). However, Blacks had a lower adjusted odds ratio (p < .05) for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) than did Whites. Furthermore, models failed to show significant gender disparities for invasive procedure utilizations. These disparities, or lack of, may be partially due to patient demographic characteristics or study limitations. Future research should focus on physician referrals and patient preferences."mycardial	Outcomes	"The prevailing view is that women have a higher early mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than men, but several studies have shown no differences. Further, long-term differences have not been addressed widely. The present study examined gender differences in short- and long-term prognoses after AMI in The Netherlands. A nationwide cohort of 21,565 patients with a first hospitalized AMI in 1995 was identified through linkage of the National Hospital Discharge Register and the population register. Crude short- and long-term mortalities were significantly higher in women than in men (28-day hazard ratio [HR] 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58 to 1.82; 5-year HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.46 to 1.59). After adjustment for age, the risk difference was attenuated at 28 days and even reversed at 5 years in favor of women (28-day HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.20; 5-year HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.99). When differences in other covariates were also taken into account, the risk differences remained virtually the same. To account for differences in reperfusion procedures, we repeated the analyses in 1,176 patients who underwent acute reperfusion therapy (angioplasty/thrombolysis). Comparable, but not statistically significant, gender differences were observed (28-day HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.74; 5-year HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.08). In conclusion, our findings in an unselected cohort covering a complete nation indicate that the worse short- and long-term prognoses after an AMI in women compared with men may largely be explained by differences in age, whereas differences in co-morbidity, origin, infarct location, and reperfusion therapy seem to contribute little."mycardial	Outcomes	"There are conflicting data about gender differences in short-term mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) after adjusting for age and other prognostic factors. Therefore, we investigated the risk profile, clinical presentation, in-hospital mortality and mechanisms of death in women and men after the first AMI.The data were obtained from a chart review of 3382 consecutive patients, 1184 (35%) women (69.7+/-10.9 years) and 2198 (65%) men (63.5+/-11.8 years) with a first AMI. The effect of gender and its interaction with age, risk factors and thrombolytic therapy on overall mortality and mechanisms of death were examined using logistic regression.Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was higher in women (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.47-2.15). Adjustment that included both age only and age and other baseline differences (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, AMI type, AMI site, mean peak CK value, thrombolytic therapy) decreased the magnitude of the relative risk of women to men but did not eliminate it (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03-1.54 and OR 1.31 95% CI 1.03-1.66, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that female gender was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality after the first AMI. Women were dying more often because of mechanical complications - refractory pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock (P=0.02) or electromechanical dissociation (P=0.03), and men were dying mostly by arrhythmic death, primary ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (P=0.002). Female gender was independently associated with mechanical death (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.35-2.58; P=0.01) and anterior AMI was independently associated with arrhythmic death (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.86; P=0.01).Our results demonstrate significant differences in mechanisms of in-hospital death after the first AMI in women and men, suggesting the possibility that higher in-hospital mortality in women exists primarily because of the postponing AMI death due to the gender-related differences in susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias following acute coronary events."mycardial	Review	"Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer of women in the United States, and marked disparities in cardiovascular health exist between women and men and among groups of women. Coronary heart disease is underdiagnosed, undertreated, and under-researched in women. Women with suspected heart disease are less likely than men to receive indicated diagnostic tests and procedures; sex-based biases in treatment of myocardial infarction persist; and women continue to be underrepresented in cardiovascular research. An accumulating body of literature points to 3 major explanations: sex-based physiology, provider bias, and psychosocial influences. Women's acute and prodromal signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction have been described, yet women have difficulty recognizing and acting on these indications. Primary and secondary prevention of heart disease in women is imperative; although the science is lacking in several areas, existing evidence on diet, hormone therapy, aspirin, physical activity and obesity, and diabetes can serve as the basis for interventions. Potentially, large impacts could be made on women's morbidity and mortality if current scientific knowledge were implemented. The state of the science of women and heart disease is reviewed, with a focus on those areas with the greatest potential to address the needs of women's cardiovascular status. Key gaps in the science and remaining questions are presented as a research agenda for the coming decade."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Risk factors for mortality in community-residing persons developing congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may differ for males and females.Persons from the Groningen Longitudinal Aging Study with incident CHF (N=274) or AMI (N=198) were identified between 1993 and 1998 and their survival status was collected in 2001. Risk factors are assessed prior to the cardiac diagnosis.The 1-, 5-, 7-year survival rates were 65, 53, 50% for AMI and 74, 45, 32% for CHF. Multivariate analyses showed that male gender, high age, smoking, diabetes and low physical function were risk factors for mortality among persons with CHF. For AMI, 1 month mortality was related to high age and baseline low body mass index, while longer term mortality was related to male gender and high age. In addition, diabetes increased longer term mortality among females but not among males with AMI. Depression was not a risk factor for mortality for either condition in either gender.Males with CHF or AMI have worse survival rates compared to females. Risk factors for mortality are predominantly similar for males and females, except for diabetes which is a risk factor among females, but not males with AMI."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is prevalent and has serious consequences including re-infarction and death. Although the risk factors for AMI have been extensively studied in Western countries, they are less well documented in Japan. To determine the risk factors for AMI, we performed a case-control study in unselected patients with AMI.Risk factors were assessed in 1,925 consecutive patients with a first AMI (age, 28-103 years old; men, 1,353; women, 572), who were admitted to one of the major institutes in Japan, and in 2,279 age-and sex-matched population-based controls. Hypertension (odds ratio (OR), 4.80; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.80 to 5.95; p < 0.01), diabetes (OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 2.50 to 4.75; p < 0.01), current smoking (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.78 to 4.18; p < 0.01), family history (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.62; p < 0.01), and hypercholesterolemia (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.62; p < 0.05) were all independent risk factors for AMI. However, obesity (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.50; NS) was not. Hypertension (OR, 4.80; 95% CI, 3.80 to 6.02; p < 0.01), current smoking (OR, 4.00; 95% CI, 3.02 to 5.00; p < 0.01), and diabetes (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.04; p < 0.01) were all independent risk factors for AMI in men. In contrast, only current smoking (OR, 8.22; 95% CI, 3.98 to 18.88; p < 0.01), diabetes (OR, 6.12; 95% CI, 3.78 to 12.02; p < 0.01), and hypertension (OR, 5.04; 95% CI, 2.92 to 7.52; p < 0.01) were independent risk factors for AMI in women. Hypercholesterolemia was an independent risk factor for AMI in men (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.98; p < 0.05), but not in women.Hypertension, diabetes, current smoking, family history and hypercholesterolemia are associated with AMI in Japanese patients, and the importance of the risk factors for AMI differs between men and women. Hypertension, current smoking, diabetes and family history are the most important risk factors in men, whereas current smoking, diabetes, hypertension and family history are the most important risk factors in women. Hypercholesterolemia is an independent risk factor for AMI in men, but not in women. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical study to define the relative importance of risk factors for AMI in Japanese patients."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Cardiac rupture can be fatal after myocardial infarction (MI). Experiments in animals revealed gender differences in rupture rate; however, patient data are controversial. We found a significantly higher rupture rate in testosterone-treated female mice within 1 wk after MI, whereas castration in males significantly reduced rupture. We hypothesized that testosterone may adversely affect remodeling after MI, exaggerating the inflammatory response and increasing cardiac rupture, whereas estrogen may be cardioprotective, attenuating early remodeling and reducing rupture rate. We studied the effect of gender and hormone manipulation on morphological and histological changes during early remodeling after MI in 4-wk-old male and female C57BL/6J mice and how these events could affect cardiac function. Females were randomly divided into 1) sham ovariectomy + placebo (s-ovx + P), 2) s-ovx + testosterone (T), 3) ovx + P, and 4) ovx + T; males were divided into 1) sham castration + P (s-cas + P), 2) s-cas + 17beta-estradiol (E), 3) cas + P, and 4) cas + E. At 6 wk after gonadectomy and hormone manipulation, MI was induced. Mice were randomly killed 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 days after MI. The left ventricle was weighed and sectioned for evaluation of MI size, infarct expansion index (IEI), and neutrophil infiltration. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in conscious mice in the 14-day group before organ harvest. Cardiac rupture rate and IEI were significantly higher in testosterone-treated females and noncastrated males than in controls; these effects were accompanied by enhanced neutrophil infiltration and pronounced deterioration of cardiac function and left ventricular dilatation. Ovariectomy in females and estrogen supplementation in males did not confer significant protection from cardiac rupture, IEI, or neutrophil infiltration. We concluded that, in mice, high testosterone levels enhance acute myocardial inflammation, adversely affecting myocardial healing and early remodeling, as indicated by increased cardiac rupture, and possibly causing deterioration of cardiac function after MI, and, conversely, estrogen seems to have no significant protective effect in the acute phase after MI."mycardial	Management	"Outcomes in women undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the contemporary era are poorly defined. The REPLACE-2 trial demonstrated that bivalirudin with provisional glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GpIIb-IIIa) blockade is noninferior to heparin with planned GpIIb-IIIa blockade during PCI, with regard to ischemic and bleeding end points.The aim of this study was to define sex-based clinical ischemic and bleeding outcomes from the REPLACE-2 trial.A retrospective sex-based subgroup analysis of the REPLACE-2 trial comparing clinical ischemic and inhospital bleeding end points was conducted.Compared with men in REPLACE-2, women were older, had more diabetes, congestive heart failure and hypertension, and less prior revascularization and myocardial infarction. Female sex was a univariate predictor of death and bleeding complications. Among women treated with either bivalirudin or heparin, there was no significant difference in the individual or composite ischemic end points of death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization at 30 days or 6 months. Protocol-defined major bleeding, minor bleeding, and access site bleeding were less frequent with bivalirudin compared with heparin. Multivariable modeling found no significant interactions between sexes, with the composite ischemic end point, major bleeding, or 1-year mortality.Women remain at higher risk for poorer outcomes with contemporary PCI, likely because of comorbidities. Bivalirudin with provisional GpIIb-IIIa confers similar protection against ischemic end points compared with heparin and planned GpIIb-IIIa blockade and significantly reduces the inherent bleeding risk of women undergoing contemporary PCI."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was found to be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality as well as adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in high-risk populations. Findings from population-based studies are scarce and inconsistent. We investigated the gender-specific association of CKD with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and incident myocardial infarction (MI) in a population-based cohort.The study was based on 3860 men and 3674 women (aged 45-74 years) who participated in one of the three MONICA Augsburg surveys between 1984 and 1995. CKD was defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 59 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox proportional hazard models. In this study, 890 total deaths, 400 CVD deaths, and 321 incident MIs occurred in men up to 31 December 2002; the corresponding numbers in women were 442, 187, and 102. In multivariable analyses, the HR for women with CKD compared to women with preserved renal function was significant for incident MI [HR 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-2.61] and CVD mortality (HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.17-2.18). In men, CKD was also significantly associated with incident MI (HR 1.51; 95% CI 1.09-2.10) and CVD mortality (HR 1.48; 95% CI 1.15-1.92) after adjustment for common CVD risk factors. In contrast, men and women with CKD had no significant increased risk of all-cause mortality.CKD was strongly associated with an increased risk of incident MI and CVD mortality independent from common cardiovascular risk factors in men and women from the general population."mycardial	REVIEW	mycardial	Management	"This paper provides important insights on gender differences across racial and ethnic groups in a Medicare population in terms of the quality of care received for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and congestive heart failure (CHF) in association with diabetes or hypertension/end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Both race/ethnicity and gender are associated with differences in the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of Medicare recipients with these conditions. In the AMI group, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients of both genders were less likely to receive aspirin or beta-blockers than non-Hispanic Whites. These differences persisted for Hispanic women and men even when they presented with ESRD or diabetes. Rates for smoking cessation counseling were among the lowest among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics with AMI-diabetes and non-Hispanic blacks with AMI-hypertension/ESRD. Gender comparisons within racial groups for the AMI and AMI-diabetes groups show that among non-Hispanic Whites, women were less likely to receive aspirin and beta-blockers. No gender differences were noted among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic Medicare recipients. In the CHF group, Hispanics were the racial/ethnic group least likely to have an assessment of left ventricular function (LVF), even if they had diabetes and had lower rates of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy or even if they had combined CHF-hypertension/ESRD. Gender comparisons in both the CHF and CHF-hypertension/ESRD groups show that non-Hispanic White women were less likely to have an LVF assessment than non-Hispanic White men. Among all subjects, having comorbidities with AMI was not associated with higher markers of quality cardiovascular care. Closing the many gaps in cardiovascular care must target the specific needs of women and men across racial and ethnic groups."mycardial	Outcomes	"Limited information exists regarding the impact of gender on in-hospital outcome after primary stenting for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).A total of 2,981 patients (790 women and 2,191 men) participated in the study who were admitted within 24 h after symptom onset and underwent emergency primary stenting for AMI. Compared with men, women were significantly older; had higher incidences of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, Killip class > or =2, and cardiogenic shock; had a higher blood glucose level and a lower serum creatinine level on admission. Other baseline characteristics, including the incidences of ST-segment elevation AMI, anterior infarction, 3-vessel disease, initial or final Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade did not significantly differ between the sexes. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in women than in men (9.4% vs 5.2%, p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, age, Killip class, blood glucose level, serum creatinine level, and final TIMI grade were independent predictors of in-hospital death, but female gender was not (odds ratio 1.01, p=0.69).Our findings suggest that in patients undergoing primary stenting for AMI, women have higher in-hospital mortality than men, but female gender itself is not independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality after adjustment for baseline differences."mycardial	Clinical	"Women are felt to have poor outcomes in coronary artery disease, largely on the basis of secondary observations in acute coronary syndrome trials. We sought to examine the neglected topic of sex differences in workup and outcomes in the general population presenting with chest pain.We examined 439 consecutive patients admitted via the emergency department with ongoing chest pain. Cardiac testing was defined as any cardiac catheterization or stress test. Positive testing was defined as a 70% or greater stenosis in an epicardial coronary artery on catheterization, or a positive stress test result. Follow-up was obtained via telephone contact at 4 months following discharge.Further cardiac testing was deemed necessary in 68% (164/241) of women and 77% (153/198) of men (P=0.038). Among women undergoing further testing, only 21% (35/164) had positive tests, whereas 41% (62/153) of men had positive tests (P=0.002). At 4 months, women were less likely to have suffered the combined endpoint of subsequent myocardial infarction, revascularization, or death, than men (15 vs. 23%, P=0.027). Events were more likely to occur in patients who had further testing, and especially in those who had positive testing.These data suggest that women admitted with chest pain are less likely to have active coronary artery disease, and much less likely to have poor outcomes at 4 months than men. This apparent 'gender protection' effect warrants further study."mycardial	Management	"It is of concern that women are more likely to undergo fewer diagnostic tests and receive less treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than men. Our retrospective Tokai Acute Myocardial Infarction Study (TAMIS) indicated that there were gender differences according to age groups; however, the exact nature of these gender differences remains unclear. Therefore, using data from TAMIS-II, we studied the influence of gender on the delivery of cardiac management according to 2 age groups (< 65, >or= 65). TAMIS-II is a prospective study of all consecutive patients admitted to the 15 acute care hospitals in the Tokai region with the diagnosis of AMI from 2001 to 2003. A total of 169 younger women, 1246 younger men, 616 older women, and 1240 older men were included. Data on patient demographics, in-hospital course, comorbid conditions, electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound-echocardiogram (UCG), treadmill test (TMT), coronary angiography (CAG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital or discharge medications (thrombolytics, vasopressors, aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, nitrates) were collected. After controlling for these baseline variables, only lipid-lowering therapy tended to be more frequent in women than in men among the elderly (OR 1.55, 95%CI 1.00-2.38). The results from this Japanese chart review study, derived from detailed clinical data, indicated that the delivery pattern of cardiac management for female and male AMI patients during hospitalization and at discharge was very similar among the younger and older populations."mycardial	Management	"Women are less likely to undergo revascularization after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We assessed whether this was due to patterns of hospital admission or less frequent revascularization even when resources are available. Using New York City hospital discharge records from 1995 to 2002, we determined revascularization rates for patients who were hospitalized for AMI. Rates of admission to hospitals capable of revascularizing and revascularization use were assessed by gender. Odds ratios of admission and procedure use were determined after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and accounting for availability of revascularization in neighborhoods of residence. Of 93,978 patients with AMI (43.7% women), 27% were revascularized (32% and 20% for men and women, respectively, p <0.001). Moreover, women were less likely than men to be admitted to hospitals capable of revascularization (45% vs 52%, p <0.001) and to undergo revascularization (54% vs 60%, p <0.001) when admitted to capable hospitals. These differences were similar for residents of neighborhoods with or without revascularization services. Odds ratios for men versus women were 1.22 (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.26) for admission to revascularizing hospitals and 1.28 (95% confidence interval 1.22 to 1.34) for using revascularization among patients in revascularization hospitals. The in-hospital mortality advantage of men over women persisted after revascularization (9.6% vs 14.5%). In conclusion, less revascularization after AMI among women was associated with less frequent admission to hospitals capable of revascularization and less frequent revascularization even when admitted to performing hospitals. However, improving revascularization among women does not eliminate the gender disparity of in-hospital death after AMI."mycardial	Management	"Studies have shown that women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are less likely to receive evidence-based care compared with men. The American College of Cardiology's AMI Guidelines Applied in Practice (GAP) program has been shown to increase the rates of evidence-based medicine use and reduce mortality in patients with AMI. The objective of this study was to investigate the relative benefits of the GAP program in men and women.By using a predesign-postdesign, standard orders, and a discharge tool to improve evidence-based indicator rates and long-term mortality in patients with AMI in Michigan, this study compared the success of GAP in men vs women. Logistic regression was used to develop predictive models for death at 30 days and 1 year in men and women.Use of evidence-based care, including use of beta-blockers and aspirin in men and women at hospital discharge and lipid-lowering agent use in men, was higher in the post-GAP sample (P<.01 for all). Use of the discharge tool promoted by the GAP program was independently protective against death at 1 year in women (adjusted odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.79), and a trend existed for similar results in men (adjusted odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-1.06). However, the tool was used slightly less often with women (27.9% vs 33.96%; P=.003).The GAP program increased the use of evidence-based therapies in male and female patients. In addition, the GAP discharge tool may decrease mortality rates at 1 year in patients with AMI; however, the tool was used less often with women. Greater use of the GAP discharge tool in women might narrow the post-MI sex mortality gap."mycardial	Outcomes	"It is a matter of concern that women have higher in-hospital mortality rates than men with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); however, it is not yet clear whether significant sex differences exist. This study aimed to determine if there are sex differences in the characteristics and in-hospital mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing PCI in Japan.We used data from 13 acute care hospitals in the Tokai region (central Japan) included in the sample from the TAMIS, a retrospective study of all patients admitted to these hospitals from 1995 to 1997 with a diagnosis of AMI. We abstracted the baseline and procedural characteristics from detailed chart reviews which included not only physician notes but also nursing notes, and a questionnaire included baseline characteristics, procedural course, and in-hospital mortality. Multivariate analysis was performed, controlling for age and other variables which were found to be significantly different between men and women by chi2 test or Mann-Whitney U test.In TAMIS, we had a total of 2020 subjects. A total of 303 women and 1033 men undergoing PCI were included in the present study. There were sex differences in age, comorbid conditions, smoking status, activities of daily living, and heart failure on presentation. In univariate analysis, women had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than men; however, this sex difference disappeared after multivariable adjustment.Our study demonstrates that women with AMI who undergo PCI do not have a significantly higher in-hospital mortality rate than men in Japan; additional larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these results."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To determine whether sex differences of in-hospital and after-discharge mortality differ according to the age.Data of 4347 consecutive patients hospitalized within 48 h of the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were analysed. Patients were classified according to median age (68 years): Group 1 (G1) (308 women, 30-67 years), G2 (1878 men, 30-67 years), G3 (860 women, 68-89 years), and G4 (1301 men, 68-89 years). In both age groups, women were older, had more frequent co-morbidities, lower rate of reperfusion therapy, and received less anti-platelet agents, beta-blockers, and statins than men. The overall 1-year mortality was higher in women (25% vs. 16% in men, P<0.0001). After adjustment, in-hospital mortality was higher only for the women in the younger age group. (G1 vs. G2: OR=2.2, 95%CI=1.3-3.8; G3 vs. G4: OR=1.1, 95%CI=the risk of death, after hospital discharge, was no longer related to gender in any age group.The higher 1-year mortality following AMI in women is explained by the higher risk of death in young women during the first days of hospitalization. Further investigations are crucial to determine the cause in order to improve the chance of survival in younger women."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"This study was conducted to examine the relationship between myocardial ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels and sex differences in myocardial infarct size after in vitro ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Hearts from adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were excised and exposed to an I/R protocol (1 h of ischemia, followed by 2 h of reperfusion) on a modified Langendorff apparatus. Hearts from female rats showed significantly smaller infarct sizes than hearts from males (23 +/- 4 vs. 40 +/- 5% of the zone at risk, respectively; P < 0.05). Administration of HMR-1098, a sarcolemmal K(ATP) channel blocker, abolished the sex difference in infarct size (42 +/- 4 vs. 45 +/- 5% of the zone at risk in hearts from female and male rats, respectively; P = not significant). Further experiments showed that blocking the K(ATP) channels in ischemia, and not reperfusion, was sufficient to increase infarct size in female rats. These data demonstrate that sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels are centrally involved in mechanisms that underlie sex differences in the susceptibility of the intact heart to I/R injury."mycardial	Review	"Recent articles have inquired about the quality of care for women presenting with cardiovascular disease. The Cooperative Cardiovascular Project and the National Heart Failure Project, 2 Medicare databases, provide national data to address concerns that women receive poorer quality care than men. In these databases, sex was not independently associated with the use of beta-blockers, assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction, or use of fibrinolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (MI), nor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prescription for heart failure. Women with MI were slightly less likely to receive aspirin and slightly more likely to receive ACE inhibitors. Among patients with equivocal indications, men were significantly more likely than women to undergo cardiac catheterization, whereas there were no sex differences among patients with strong indication. Women were more likely than men to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention and less likely to receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Short-term mortality rates after MI and readmission rates after heart failure did not vary significantly by gender; however, risk of mortality after heart failure was slightly lower for women. Within multivariate models, gender differences in treatment were small and in many cases insignificant. These national datasets fail to reveal a strong sex bias in treatment among patients aged > or = 65 years."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To assess gender-based differences in presentation and outcome after non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in clinical practice, this study examined data from the Acute Coronary Syndrome registry, which enrolled 16,817 patients from 2000 through the end of 2002, 6,358 of them with NSTEMIs (34.1% women). Women with NSTEMIs were 7.5 years older, had a history of myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft less often, and were less likely to have smoked. They more often had a history of systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus, but this difference was due to their older age. Reperfusion therapy was performed less often in women, which still was significant after adjustment for baseline variables (odds ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.80). Clopidogrel was given less often in women (43.4% vs 56%). After adjustment for age, gender differences in medical therapy with statins, aspirin, and beta blockers were not significant. Hospital mortality was 1.7 times greater in women. This difference was not significant after adjustment for age (odds ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.35). Women had greater crude long-term mortality, but after age adjustment, this difference was no longer significant (odds ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.11). In conclusion, women with NSTEMIs were older than men and thus more often had concomitant diseases but less often had a history of myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass grafts. They less often received acute percutaneous coronary intervention and less often were treated with clopidogrel. However, there was no difference in age-adjusted mortality in women."mycardial	Management	"Previous randomized trials have addressed the impact of gender on outcomes, showing worse results in women assigned to invasive strategies compared with men with non-ST-elevation (NSTE) acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, there is still a significant amount of controversy on strategies of treatment on the basis of gender. This study evaluated the impact of gender on treatment strategies and outcomes in patients with NSTE ACS in a high-volume, single-site tertiary center. We identified 1,197 consecutive patients with NSTE ACS (381 women, 816 men) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention during their index hospitalizations. Patients were stratified by gender and baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics, and in-hospital and 9-month clinical outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. There were clear differences in baseline characteristics between men and women with ACS at presentation. Women were, on average, slightly older than men, with more hypertension and morbid obesity, but there were no differences in racial backgrounds or the prevalence of diabetes or dyslipidemia, nor were there treatment disparities in pharmacologic interventions. Women and men with ACS had similar rates of percutaneous coronary intervention on index admission. Women had a greater incidence of bleeding complications requiring blood transfusions. Overall, in-hospital and 9-month event-free survival were equivalent for the 2 genders. In conclusion, in this single-site observational study, patients with NSTE ACS who underwent angiography followed by percutaneous coronary intervention demonstrated no significant gender differences in treatment or in-hospital or 9-month event-free survival. From these results, interventional strategies should not be based on gender."mycardial	Management	"Recent studies have been inconsistent in demonstrating a decrease in the gender gap in short-term post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes. We sought to determine gender differences in outcomes in younger and older patients who underwent PCI during the current stent era. We studied 4,768 elective PCI procedures performed at Emory University Hospital from 2001 to 2004. The baseline characteristics, periprocedural complications, angiographic success, procedural success, and major in-hospital complications (death, myocardial infarction, and emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery) after PCI were compared between men and women. Women were more likely to be nonwhite and older, with a greater prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (all p <0.001) compared with men. After adjusting for baseline characteristics and coronary artery size, the incidence of coronary vascular injury complications was higher in women than in men, particularly in patients <or=55 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49 to 5.04). The difference was less when comparing women and men >55 years (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.99, p = 0.047 for gender-age interaction). The adjusted odds of bleeding complications were also higher in women than in men (<or=55 years OR 5.39, 95% CI 2.26 to 12.8, >55 years OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.68 to 3.87, p = 0.121 for gender-age interaction). No significant gender differences were present in a combined end point of death, myocardial infarction, and emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery. In conclusion, among patients who have undergone PCI, women, particularly younger women, are more likely than men to experience coronary vascular injury and bleeding complications unaccounted for by coronary artery size and other patient characteristics. No differences were found in major in-hospital complications by gender."mycardial	Management	"Despite the effectiveness of early beta-blocker (BB) use in reducing mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), they remain underutilized in the emergency department (ED) management of AMI. The elderly, with higher AMI mortality, and women, may be particularly vulnerable to underutilization of BB.To determine the effect of age and gender on BB use in AMI in the ED.A retrospective study of all ST-elevation AMI (STEMI) ED patients presenting to a community hospital ED from 2001 to 2003. Any contraindication to BB use (hypotension, bradycardia, AV block, active bronchospasm, and active congestive heart failure) was determined. Chi-square analysis was used to determine differences by gender and age.Three hundred eighty-five patients with STEMI were identified. Thirty-eight percent were women and 71% were over 60 years of age. Of the 270 (70%) who did not receive BB, 141 (52%) had contraindications to BB use. The total BB eligible group was 244 (63%). Of patients without contraindications to BB, 53% did not receive BB in the ED. By gender, 83 (54%) males and 46 (51%) females did not receive BB (P=.669). By age, 96 subjects (59%) over age 60 and 33 subjects (41%) under age 60 did not receive BB (P=.011).Despite convincing evidence of effectiveness, BB remain underutilized in ED management of AMI, especially in the elderly. There does not appear to be a gender difference in BB use. Education programs should be directed towards emergency physicians regarding BB use in AMI, especially in elderly ED patients."mycardial	Management	"Whether there are gender differences in the prognostic application of gated myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has not been assessed.Gender-specific normal limits of poststress volume and ejection fraction (EF) were obtained in 597 women and 824 men with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease and normal perfusion and were applied in a prognostic evaluation of 6713 patients (2735 women and 3978 men). Patients underwent rest thallium-201/stress technetium-99m sestamibi gated myocardial perfusion SPECT and were followed up for 35 +/- 14 months. The upper limit of the end-systolic volume (ESV) index was 27 mL/m2 in women and 39 mL/m2 in men, and the upper limit of the end-diastolic volume index was 60 mL/m2 in women and 75 mL/m2 in men. The lower limit of the EF was 51% in women and 43% in men. Gated SPECT variables provided incremental prognostic information in both genders. Women with severe ischemia and an EF lower than 51% or an ESV index greater than 27 mL/m2 were at very high risk of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (3-year event rates of 39.8% and 35.1%, respectively), whereas women with severe ischemia but an EF of 51% or greater or an ESV index of 27 mL/m2 or less were at intermediate or high risk (3-year event rates of 10.8% and 15.2%, respectively).Poststress EF and ESV index by gated myocardial perfusion SPECT provide comparable incremental prognostic information over perfusion in women and men. After separate criteria for abnormal EF and ESV index in women are used, the combination of severe ischemia and abnormal EF or ESV index identifies women at very high risk of cardiac events."mycardial	Management	"It has been shown that women are at greater risk than men of not receiving screening and treatment services for coronary heart disease. The purpose of this research was to determine whether there were gender disparities in the use of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Pennsylvania in 2000 and, if so, whether outcomes were affected.Data included 10,170 patients treated with PCI and 21,181 patients medically managed in Pennsylvania hospitals. Multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression to estimate the impact of gender on PCI. In addition, we performed retrospective matching on propensity scores to compare outcomes for women who were treated with PCI to comparable groups of women and men.After controlling for age, race/ethnicity, severity at admission, location of infarct, and source of admission, women had 24% lower odds than men of receiving PCI (P<0.0001). In a propensity score-matched sample of 3023 women who received PCI and 3023 women who did not, women who received PCI were significantly less likely to die (2.3% vs. 10.4%, P<0.0001). In a second propensity score-matched sample of 3329 women and 3329 similar men who received PCI, the difference in mortality was not statistically significant (1.59% vs. 1.92%, P=0.39).These results suggest that the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI in women could be reduced by increased use of PCI and that more women admitted for AMI should receive consideration for PCI."mycardial	Management	"This paper reports the findings of a study that identified gender specific prehospital care pathway delays amongst Irish women and men with myocardial infarction.Women are more likely to experience a poorer prognosis than their male counterparts following hospitalization for myocardial infarction, yet research shows that women continue to experience prehospital care pathway delays.A 1-year prospective census was carried in six major academic teaching hospitals in Dublin, Ireland in 2001-2002. A total of 277 (31%) female and 613 (69%) male patients with confirmed myocardial infarction were included in the study.Women were more likely to experience prolonged 'initial symptom-onset to A&E delays' (14 hours vs. 2.8 hours P < 0.0001), and 'intense symptom-onset to A&E delays' (3.1 hours vs. 1.8 hours , P < 0.0001), i.e. arrival at a hospital accident and emergency department. Advancing age was associated with greater prehospital delays (P < 0.0001), whilst patients with private health insurance had shorter delays than public patients (without private health insurance) or those with medical cards (entitling them to means-tested medical benefits) (P = 0.001). Patients who drove themselves by car to hospital had shorter median prehospital times than those arriving by any other admission mode (P < 0.0001), whilst those referred by their general practitioner had longer delays than those who were self-referred (5 hours vs. 1.7 hours, P < 0.0001).Female gender, advancing age, referral source, insurance status and mode of transport to hospital are independent factors contributing to prehospital patient delays. Nurses who care for patients with coronary artery disease have a unique opportunity to educate people about the most appropriate action to be taken in the event of experiencing symptoms."mycardial	Management	"Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) has been socially constructed as a gender-specific disease with women not seen to be at risk. Women tend to delay seeking help following the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (MI). An illness perceptions approach has been used to explain treatment-seeking behaviour.The aim of this study was to explore the illness perceptions of a sample of women following acute MI using the self-regulatory model of illness behaviour as the theoretical framework.Ten women, with a range of ages, took part in semi-structured interviews, 3 months following an acute infarct. Data were analysed thematically according to the theoretical framework.The development of a serious model of the illness and the decision to seek help was influenced by the experience of severe, unusual symptoms especially if of sudden onset; the absence of co-morbidities and similarities to the known experience of others. Perceived lack of susceptibility to the disease and a belief that symptoms were benign may have resulted in a delay in seeking help. Coping strategies were initially aimed at relieving symptoms before seeking help from families and friends. This resulted in a call for professional help.Health promotion strategies need to emphasis the uniqueness of the individual's experience. Interventions designed to alter illness perceptions may influence treatment-seeking behaviour."mycardial	Clinical	"Heart disease is the number one killer in the USA. In Jordan, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, and about 34.5% of women die of cardiovascular disease as compared with 44.25% of men. The differences between men and women in heart disease, such as signs and symptoms presentation, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, are becoming more apparent in the literature. There is a dearth of research regarding gender differences among Jordanian myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the differences between Jordanian men and women in signs and symptoms presentation of MI and follow-up care. A convenience sample of 83 patients (26 women and 57 men) who were diagnosed with MI, mentally competent and haemodynamically stable were used to explore the research questions. An interview guide and chart audit were used to elicit information about initial and associated signs and symptoms and treatment plan of MI patients. Chest pain was the most common initial symptom in both men and women. The four most common associated signs and symptoms reported by both men and women were general weakness, sweating, nausea and fatigue. However, women experienced more general weakness and sweating compared with men. Women were less likely to receive intravenous nitroglycerin, heparin and thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of MI. Chest pain was the initial symptom of MI reported by men and women. Although similarities exist in the associated sings and symptoms, women might experience different associated signs and symptoms from men. Despite these similarities, women are still less likely than men to receive the therapeutic regimen used for men."mycardial	Outcomes	"To determine whether women have an unfavorable outcome after coronary interventions compared with men, we evaluated patients undergoing revascularisation within the Arterial Revascularisation Therapies Study (ARTS).We evaluated 1205 patients (23% women) with multivessel disease randomised to percutaneous or surgical coronary revascularisation. The in-hospital results, and clinical outcome at five years were evaluated. Women were older, with a higher prevalence of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, family history for coronary artery disease (all p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (p=0.05) and stable angina (p<0.05) than men, but had a lower incidence of history of myocardial infarction or smoking (both p<0.001). More major bleeding complications, even after adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics (OR 29.4, 95% CI: 5.3-500, p<0.005) were observed in women following percutaneous coronary intervention. During clinical follow-up freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was similar in men and women, regardless of treatment strategy. Men assigned to bypass surgery had a better quality of life, but women reported more frequently angina.The clinical outcome of women with multivessel disease undergoing coronary revascularisation was similar to that in men. However, women presented more bleeding complications before hospital discharge, and had less favourable assessment in specific domain of daily life at follow-up."mycardial	Outcomes	"Women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) exhibit greater hospital mortality than do men. In general, diabetes mellitus is one of the major factors influencing the outcome of patients with AMI. The aim of this study was to analyze the interaction between diabetes and gender, specifically with regard to the higher hospital mortality of female AMI patients aged < or = 75 years.We prospectively collected data from 3,715 patients aged < or = 75 (2,794 men, 921 women) with acute myocardial infarction who were treated in 25 hospitals in Berlin, Germany, from 1999 to 2002. In a multivariate analysis, we specifically studied the interaction between the factors diabetes mellitus and gender in their effects on hospital mortality.After adjustment in multivariate analysis, the interaction between gender and diabetes was statistically significant, and the estimated odds ratios were as follows: female diabetic patients compared with male diabetic patients, odds ratio (OR) = 2.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-3.68); female diabetic patients compared with male nondiabetic patients, OR = 2.90 (95% CI 1.90-4.42); and female diabetic patients compared with female nondiabetic patients, OR = 2.92 (95% CI 1.75-4.87). There was no statistically significant difference between the risk of dying for female nondiabetic patients or for male diabetic patients when compared with male nondiabetic patients.In AMI patients aged < or = 75 years, female gender alone is not an independent predictor of hospital mortality. Detailed, multivariate analysis reveals that specifically diabetic women demonstrate higher hospital mortality than do men. Special attention should be provided to these female diabetic patients."mycardial	Outcomes	"This paper describes gender differences in perceived coping, social support and quality of life 1, 4 and 12 months after myocardial infarction.There is a shortage of studies with a longitudinal research design investigating coping, social support and quality of life in women and men after myocardial infarction.A longitudinal, descriptive and comparative design was used for the study, which included 74 women and 97 men. At 12 months, 60 women and 88 men remained. Data were collected using the Jalowiec Coping Scale, a social support questionnaire, the SF-36 Health Survey (health-related quality of life) and the Quality of Life Index-Cardiac version (quality of life). The data were collected during the period 1999-2001.No statistically significant changes over time in coping assessments emerged in the study group, except for fatalistic coping, which diminished over time in men. Women used more evasive coping than men at 4 and 12 months. The perceived efficiency in coping with physical aspects of the heart disease increased. More women than men perceived available support from grandchildren and staff of the church. Health-related quality of life increased in women and men in physical functioning, role-physical, vitality, social functioning, and role-emotional scales. Moreover, an improvement in the mental health scale was evident in women and a reduction in pain in men. No statistically significant gender differences were found for quality of life at any point in time.The findings can be used to inform caregivers that optimistic, self-reliant and confrontational coping were the most frequently used by both women and men over the first year after myocardial infarction, and that confrontational coping has been shown to have positive outcomes in the longer term. Nurses should tell women about the importance of seeking prompt treatment and discuss health problems with caregivers and significant others. Care planning should include family members and significant others so that they can support and encourage patients to cope with problems in daily life."mycardial	Management	"This paper reports the in-hospital findings of a study identifying gender specific care pathway delays or treatment opportunities amongst Irish women and men hospitalized with myocardial infarction.Reperfusion therapy is of optimum benefit when administered early, yet research shows that women continue to experience greater in-hospital delays to treatment than men.A 1-year prospective census was carried out from December 2001 to November 2002 with 277 (31%) female and 613 (69%) male patients with myocardial infarction who were consecutively admitted to the six major teaching hospitals in Dublin, Ireland.Women experienced greater 'Triage to first medical assessment' delays than men (P=0.001), and waited a median of 30 minutes for their first medical contact, compared with 20 minutes for men (P<0.0001). The median 'door to needle' time for women was 70 minutes in comparison with 52 minutes for men (P=0.02). Women waited longer than men for aspirin (P=0.02), whilst men received a bed in the coronary care unit almost 1 hour sooner than women (P<0.0001). Despite these delays to treatment, women and men experienced similar rates of reperfusion treatment.In-hospital treatment delays experienced by women may limit their potential to achieve the maximum benefits from reperfusion therapies. Triage nursing provides the first entry point to hospital care for the majority of female patients with myocardial infarction, and therefore Accident and Emergency Department nurses are in an optimum position to influence positively the pathway of care for this group."mycardial	Management	"It is of concern that women are more likely to undergo fewer diagnostic tests and receive less treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than men. However, it is still unclear whether gender differences exist according to age groups. Therefore, we studied the influence of gender on the delivery of cardiac management according to two age groups (< 65, >or= 65) in Japan. Data from the Tokai Acute Myocardial Infarction Study (TAMIS) sample were used. This is a retrospective study of all consecutive patients admitted to the 13 acute care hospitals in the Tokai region of Japan, which includes Aichi and Shizuoka Prefectures, with a diagnosis of AMI from 1995 to 1997. A total of 143 younger women, 822 younger men, 391 older women, and 611 older men were included. Information concerning patient demographics, in-hospital course, comorbid conditions, electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound-echocardiography (UCG), treadmill test (TMT), coronary angiography (CAG), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital or discharge medication (thrombolytics, vasopressors, aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, nitrates) were collected. Among the young, after controlling for these baseline variables, women were significantly less likely to undergo PTCA compared to men (OR, 0.54, 95%CI, 0.35-0.82). After controlling for these baseline variables, only lipid-lowering therapy tended to be more frequent in women than in men among the elderly (OR, 2.79, 95%CI, 1.47-2.58). The findings suggest that younger women with AMI are less likely than younger men to undergo PTCA, and that older women with AMI are more likely to receive lipid-lowering therapy."mycardial	Review	"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in women costing more than 500,000 lives each year in the United States alone. Major depression in healthy subjects increases cardiovascular mortality in both men and women. The presence of major depression in patients with recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or unstable angina more than doubles the risk of cardiac death in both men and women. In the presence of depression, lack of social integration has an additive effect on cardiac events. Depression is more prevalent in women with coronary heart disease (CHD) than in men. Psychologic counseling as well as cognitive behavioral treatment in women post-AMI seems to adversely affect prognosis, whereas it has neutral effects in men. Pharmacologic treatment of depression with serotonin reuptake inhibitors is safe in men and women post-AMI and is particularly effective in patients with recurrent depression. Whether effective treatment of depression lowers cardiac mortality remains to be proven."mycardial	Epidemiology	"The goal of this study is to compare the magnitude of diabetes and myocardial infarction (MI) at baseline and during follow-up on cause-specific and all-cause mortality.History of both MI and diabetes are strong predictors of coronary heart disease (CHD) death. However, gender-specific data on the joint effect of diabetes and MI, and particularly on the effect of incident diabetes and MI developed during the follow-up, on CHD mortality are scarce.The baseline cohort study included 2,416 patients with prior diabetes or MI at baseline; the follow-up cohort study included 4,315 patients with incident diabetes or MI diagnosed during the follow-up.In the baseline cohort study, men with prior MI had a 20% to 80% increased risk of CHD or total mortality, but women with prior MI had a 43% to 45% decreased risk of CHD or total mortality in comparison with men and women with prior diabetes. In the follow-up cohort study, men and women with incident MI had a higher risk of CHD mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.15 in men and 1.65 in women), and an almost similar risk of total mortality (HR 0.95 in men and 1.02 in women) in comparison with men and women with incident diabetes.In men, MI at baseline or during follow-up confers a greater risk on CHD mortality than diabetes does. In women, prior MI at baseline confers a lower risk on CHD mortality than prior diabetes does, but incident MI during follow-up confers a greater risk than incident diabetes does. In both men and women, total mortality is similar for incident MI and diabetes."mycardial	Outcomes	"We investigated the associations of type 2 diabetes and a history of myocardial infarction (MI) with coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular and total mortality, and whether these effects are different in men and women.Study cohorts included 51,735 Finnish men and women aged 25-74 years. Smoking status and the history of MI and type 2 diabetes were recorded, and height, weight, blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels were measured at baseline. Additional data on the occurrence of diabetes and MI prior to baseline survey were obtained from national hospital discharge and drug registers through computerised register linkage. Mortality data were obtained from the national mortality register.During a mean follow-up period of 17.2 years, 9,201 deaths were recorded. Hazard ratios (HRs) for coronary mortality were 2.1, 4.0 and 6.4 among men with diabetes alone, men with MI alone, and men with diabetes and MI, respectively, compared with men with neither diabetes nor a history of MI. The corresponding HRs among women were 4.9, 2.5 and 9.4, respectively. The equivalent HRs for cardiovascular and total mortality were 2.2, 3.3 and 6.0, and 1.8, 2.3 and 3.7 in men, and 4.4, 2.4 and 6.5, and 3.2, 1.7 and 4.4 in women, respectively. Diabetic men and women had similar total mortality rates, whereas total mortality rates were markedly higher among men in the other three diabetes-MI categories.Diabetes and MI markedly increase cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. In women, the association between diabetes and mortality was stronger than that between MI and mortality, whereas the converse was true among men."mycardial	Review	"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in women. Pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, and outcomes of coronary artery disease (CAD) differ in women, and a better understanding of the sex differences in these factors will potentially lead to a slowing of this epidemic in women. Often forgotten, women have higher complication rates post revascularization and higher in-hospital mortality post myocardial infarction compared with men despite a smaller burden of disease in women. Though overall women share the same risk factors as men in the development of CAD, certain risk factors appear to be particularly ominous, such as the presence of diabetes mellitus, low values of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high triglycerides, and psychologic depression. Disease detection in advanced CAD is more accurate with stress echocardiography (ECG) and perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography imaging in women than with stress ECG. Subclincial atherosclerotic disease detection with carotid artery intima media thickness assessment provides an opportunity to target preventive measures in women. This article focuses on some of the sex-specific differences."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"The strikingly lower incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) in premenopausal women than in men of the same age suggests an important role for sex hormones in the etiology of MI. Supporting such a role are studies, carried out mostly in men, that report abnormalities of sex hormone levels in patients with MI, correlations of sex hormone levels with degree of atherosclerosis and with levels of risk factors for MI, and changes in the levels of risk factors with administration of sex hormones. Studies have also reported a prospective relationship in men of testosterone level with progression of atherosclerosis, accumulation of visceral adipose tissue, and other risk factors for MI. Puzzling, however, is that neither the level of testosterone nor of estrogen was found to be predictive of coronary events in any of the eight prospective studies that have been carried out. Also puzzling is that whereas the gender difference in incidence of MI would suggest that testosterone promotes and/or estrogen prevents MI, the cross- sectional, hormone administration, and prospective studies have suggested that in men testosterone may prevent and estrogen promote MI. These studies have thus revealed an estrogen-androgen paradox: that endogenous sex hormones may relate both to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its risk factors oppositely in women and men. Recently recognized experiments of nature and their knockout mouse models may present another manifestation of this estrogen-androgen paradox and could help resolve these apparent contradictions."mycardial	Management	"The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are gender-associated differences in the amount of myocardial salvage after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Despite having a more adverse cardiovascular risk profile, women with AMI have similar or even better outcomes after primary PCI compared with men. The reasons for these findings are unclear.In this study we included 202 women and 561 men with AMI who underwent primary PCI in the setting of three randomized trials. The primary end point of the study was myocardial salvage index (proportion of initial perfusion defect salvaged by reperfusion therapy), obtained by paired scintigraphic studies performed 7 to 10 days apart.The amount of myocardium at risk or initial perfusion defect (median [25th, 75th percentiles]) did not differ significantly between women and men (22.0% [12.0, 40.0] vs. 24.0% [14.0, 39.0] of the left ventricle [LV], p = 0.26). Final infarct size, measured in the follow-up scintigraphy, was significantly smaller in women than in men (6.0% [0.71, 18.7] vs. 10.0% [3.9, 21.8] of the LV, p = 0.001). Myocardial salvage index was 0.64 (0.35, 0.95) in women versus 0.50 (0.26, 0.77) in men (p < 0.001). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, female gender was an independent predictor of greater myocardial salvage after PCI (p = 0.002).The efficacy of primary PCI in patients with AMI appears to be gender-dependent. Myocardial salvage achieved by primary PCI is greater in women than in men."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Although it is well known that the acute myocardial infarction can be triggered by events such as physical activity, emotional stress, sexual activity or eating, the observed frequencies of these events preceding the onset of myocardial infarction vary between published reports.A meta-analysis of 17 seldom population-based studies that included data on frequency of external triggers or onsets during sleep was performed. In each analysis, the data were combined only from the studies reporting on a particular trigger.Of the 10519 patients, heavy physical activity was recorded before the onset of myocardial infarction in 6.1%, whereas mild-to-moderate physical activity was recorded in 28.6% of 7517 patients. Eating preceded the onset in 8.2% of 4785 patients, various kinds of emotional stress in 6.8% of 2565 (particularly anger in 2.1% of 2283), meteorologic stress in 3.7% of 3371, and sexual activity in 1.1% of 3406 patients. Out of 11778 patients, 20.7% had infarction onset during sleep. Triggers in general (OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.21-1.76; p < 0.0001), heavy physical activity (OR = 6.21, 95%CI = 3.77-10.23; p < 0.0001) and eating (OR = 1.70, 95%CI = 1.14-2.53; p = 0.0008) were more likely to precede the infarction onset in men while women were more likely to report emotional stress (OR = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.50-0.86; p = 0.002).The present meta-analysis defines the occurrence of possible external triggers before the onset of myocardial infarction in general population, but their actual contribution to the very onset is somewhat less frequent. Future investigation should identify other eventual triggers unrecognized as yet, asses the risk of triggering myocardial infarction among patients with defined levels of ischemic heart disease or plaque vulnerability, and further elucidate the pathophysiologic mechanisms of gender differences and beneficial effect of habitual physical activity."mycardial	Management	"The American Heart Association has a national network of community-based programs designed to reduce response times to cardiac emergencies by improving access to automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) among laypersons. Success of these Operation Heartbeat programs depends in part on the public's knowledge of the warning signs of a myocardial infarction (MI) and appropriate response to cardiac arrest victims. In May 2000, a 7-minute telephone survey was administered to a random sample of adults residing within the American Heart Association affiliate territories of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to determine the knowledge of MI symptoms, confidence in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) use, and the awareness of AEDs. Of the respondents, 60% were women (n=1,128), 83% were Caucasians (n=1,558), 15.2% were non-whites (African American, Asian, or Hispanic), and 38.5% had at least a college degree (n=724). Women were significantly more likely than men to know that sex differences exist in the warning signs for an MI (63% vs. 30.7%, respectively; P< .001). Whites had above-average confidence in MI recognition compared with non-whites (39.2% vs. 27.4%, respectively; P< .001) and were more cognizant of the public availability of AEDs (54.5% vs. 33.2%, respectively; P< .001). Our findings suggest that racial/ethnic and sex disparities exist in the awareness of AEDs and in the knowledge of atypical MI symptoms in women, respectively. Innovative CPR outreach programs might be needed in New York area communities to increase CPR training among all adults, to increase AED awareness in vulnerable populations, and to improve knowledge and confidence in the recognition of acute MI symptoms."mycardial	Review	"Recognizing similarities and differences in symptom experiences of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) between men and women has implications for both health care providers and the general public. Rapid accurate diagnosis is necessary to implement timely lifesaving treatment. The purpose of this article is to critically review and evaluate studies that have compared symptoms of AMI between men and women. Research to date has demonstrated that during AMI, women are more likely than men to report shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, back pain, jaw pain, neck pain, cough, and fatigue, but less likely than men to report chest pain and sweating. However, the findings were inconsistent across studies. These inconsistent findings could be attributable to methodological issues such as collecting data from medical records, small sample sizes, and controversial eligibility criteria for studies. More studies are needed to confirm gender differences in symptom experiences of AMI."mycardial	Management	"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of gender on long-term prognosis of patients undergoing dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE).Gender differences in the predictors of outcome among patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease undergoing DSE have not been adequately studied.We studied 2,276 men and 1,105 women with known or suspected coronary artery disease who underwent DSE. Follow-up events were cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).Dobutamine stress echocardiography was normal in 687 men (30%) and 483 women (44%) (p <0.0001). Ischemia on DSE was present in 1,194 men (52%) and 416 women (38%) (p <0.001). During a mean follow-up of 7 +/- 3.4 years, there were 894 (26%) deaths (442 attributed to cardiac causes) and 145 (4%) nonfatal MIs. The annual cardiac event rate was 2.5% in men and 1.2% in women with normal DSE. Independent predictors of cardiac events in patients with normal DSE using a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were male gender (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.7 [range 1.1 to 2.8]), age (HR: 1.02 [range 1.01 to 1.04]), history of heart failure (HR: 3.4 [range 1.5 to 7.9]), previous MI (HR: 1.7 [range 1.1 to 2.8]), and diabetes (HR: 2.4 [range 1.3 to 4.5]). Independent predictors of cardiac events in patients with an abnormal DSE were age (HR: 1.03 [range 1.02 to 1.04]), history of heart failure (HR: 1.7 [range 1.3 to 2.1]), diabetes (HR: 1.4 [range 1.1 to 1.8]), heart rate at rest (HR: 2.8 [range 1.4 to 5.8]), wall motion abnormalities at rest (HR: 1.06 [range 1.04 to 1.09]), and ischemia on DSE (HR: 1.04 [range 1.02 to 1.07]). Myocardial ischemia was an independent predictor of cardiac events in both men and women.Dobutamine stress echocardiography provides independent prognostic information in both men and women. In patients with normal DSE, gender is independently associated with cardiac events. The outcome of patients with abnormal DSE is not related to gender, after adjusting for stress echocardiographic abnormalities."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Patients (n = 194) with confirmed acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were interviewed to determine sociodemographic, clinical, social, behavioral, cognitive and emotional factors that contribute to delay in seeking treatment for their symptoms. Initial symptom experience was similar for men and women: both were most commonly at home when symptoms began; both were most commonly in the presence of their spouse or other family member; few patients (<10%) called the emergency medical system as their first reaction. Several factors contributed similarly to delay in men and women. Factors that exerted a differential effect on delay between men and women were age, history of AMI, type of AMI (Q-wave and non-Q-wave), concerns about not wanting to trouble others, and prior knowledge of thrombolytics. There was no difference in delay between men and women (median 3.08 versus 3.10 h), but there are important gender differences in the reasons patients delay and in their patterns of decision-making that may assist clinicians trying to tailor interventions."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Recent studies on mice with surgically induced acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have documented the frequent occurrence of ventricular rupture, an event not previously reported in other laboratory species. We have examined the natural history, histopathology and myocardial mechanical strength in mice with AMI.AMI was induced by coronary artery occlusion and animals were monitored for fatal events. Gross and histological examinations were undertaken.Rupture occurred in the left ventricular free wall at 2-6 days after AMI. Incidence of rupture in male mice varied among three strains studied (3% for FVB/N, 27% for C57B/6J, and 59% for 129sv, P<0.05) and was lower in female than male mice (23% vs. 59%, P<0.05). Histologically, ruptured hearts had rapid-occurring and severe infarct expansion, multifocal intramural hemorrhage and leucoyte infiltration at the border zone and infarcted zone. In vitro, infarcted left ventricles demonstrated a 50-60% reduction in muscle tensile strength. This reduction preceded the onset of rupture and was related to the time-window of rupture and to infarct size.LV wall rupture in the mouse occurs within a narrow time-window after AMI and is strain- and gender-dependent. Infarct expansion, regional hemorrhage with formation of hematoma and leuocyte accumulation are important pathological changes leading to reduced myocardial tensile strength."mycardial	Outcomes	"The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the first myocardial infarction (MI) and the relative influence of preexisting confounding factors on anxiety and depression in the following 5 years.A total of 23,693 participants, 35-79 years of age at baseline, attended two population-based prospective studies in 1984-1986 and in 1995-1997. They underwent physical examination and self-reported demographic, lifestyle, psychosocial, and medical health characteristics in both surveys. Outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression rating Scale (HADS).Five hundred twelve participants suffered their first MI in the last 5 years before follow-up. Women showed an increased risk for both anxiety and depression in the first 2 years post-MI, followed by a significant symptom reduction. In contrast, the risk for depression in men increased after 2 years post-MI. Anxiety and depression, low educational level, obesity, daily smoking, and physical inactivity pre-MI significantly predicted a poor psychiatric outcome at follow-up.Five-year follow-up after MI revealed gender-specific outcomes of anxiety and depression not previously described."mycardial	Management	"Although increased attention has been paid to sex and racial differences in the management of myocardial infarction, it is unknown whether these differences have narrowed over time.With the use of data from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction, we examined sex and racial differences in the treatment of patients who were deemed to be ""ideal candidates"" for particular treatments and in deaths among 598,911 patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction between 1994 and 2002.In the unadjusted analysis, sex and racial differences were observed for rates of reperfusion therapy (for white men, white women, black men, and black women: 86.5, 83.3, 80.4, and 77.8 percent, respectively; P<0.001), use of aspirin (84.4, 78.7, 83.7, and 78.4 percent, respectively; P<0.001), use of beta-blockers (66.6, 62.9, 67.8, and 64.5 percent; P<0.001), and coronary angiography (69.1, 55.9, 64.0, and 55.0 percent; P<0.001). After multivariable adjustment, racial and sex differences persisted for rates of reperfusion therapy (risk ratio for white women, black men, and black women: 0.97, 0.91, and 0.89, respectively, as compared with white men) and coronary angiography (relative risk, 0.91, 0.82, and 0.76) but were attenuated for the use of aspirin (risk ratio, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.94) and beta-blockers (risk ratio, 0.98, 1.00, and 0.96); all risks were unchanged over time. Adjusted in-hospital mortality was similar among white women (risk ratio, 1.05; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.07) and black men (risk ratio, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.00), as compared with white men, but was higher among black women (risk ratio, 1.11; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.16) and was unchanged over time.Rates of reperfusion therapy, coronary angiography, and in-hospital death after myocardial infarction, but not the use of aspirin and beta-blockers, vary according to race and sex, with no evidence that the differences have narrowed in recent years."mycardial	Management	"To assess the effect of gender on the in-hospital management of patients with acute inferior or posterior myocardial infarction (MI).Retrospective analysis of clinical records. Gender differences in management and prognosis were assessed by stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis.University, large-volume, tertiary hospital.We studied 1,178 consecutive patients admitted to our coronary care unit with an acute inferior or posterior MI, and evaluated the influence of gender on clinical management and outcome.None.Women were older (73 years vs 66 years), had a higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, presented later (8 h vs 6 h after symptom onset), and had a higher in-hospital mortality rate (26% vs 9%) [all p values < 0.01]. Women underwent reperfusion therapy (45% vs 61%, p < 0.01), noninvasive studies (30% vs 62%, p < 0.001), and coronary angiography (34% vs 48%, p < 0.01) less often than men. Multivariable analysis revealed that female gender was an independent predictor of a lower use of noninvasive studies (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24 to 0.63; p < 0.005) and coronary angiography (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.93; p = 0.02). A significant interaction between age and gender was found (p = 0.002); therefore, women > or = 75 years old had a much lower probability of undergoing noninvasive tests and coronary angiography than men of the same age.Despite their worse prognosis, women undergo noninvasive studies and coronary angiography less frequently than men after an acute inferior or posterior MI. The gender gap increases in patients > or = 75 years old."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Left ventricular (LV) remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) results from hypertrophy of myocytes and activation of fibroblasts induced, in part, by ligand stimulation of the ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R). The purpose of the present study was to explore the specific role for activation of the AT 1a R subtype in post-MI remodeling and whether gender differences exist in the patterns of remodeling in wild-type and AT 1a R knockout (KO) mice. AT 1a R-KO mice and wild-type littermates underwent coronary ligation to induce MI or sham procedures; echocardiography and hemodynamic evaluation were performed 6 wk later, and LV tissue was harvested for infarct size determination, morphometric measurements, and gene expression analysis. Survival and infarct size were similar among all male and female wild-type and AT 1a R-KO mice. Hemodynamic indexes were also similar except for lower systolic blood pressure in the AT 1a R-KO mice compared with wild-type mice. Male and female wild-type and male AT 1a R-KO mice developed similar increases in LV chamber size, LV mass corrected for body weight (LV/BW), and myocyte cross-sectional area (CSA). However, female AT 1a R-KO mice demonstrated no increase in LV/BW and myocyte CSA post-MI compared with shams. Both male and female wild-type mice demonstrated higher atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels after MI, with female wild types being significantly greater than males. However, male and female AT 1a R-KO mice developed no increase in ANP gene expression with MI despite an increase in LV mass and myocyte size in males. These data support that gender-specific patterns of LV and myocyte hypertrophy exist after MI in mice with a disrupted AT 1a R gene, and suggest that myocyte hypertrophy post-MI in females relies, in part, on activation of the AT 1a R. Further work is necessary to explore the potential mechanisms underlying these gender-based differences."mycardial	Management	"Women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing primary angioplasty have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than do men. Whether contemporary interventional treatment strategies have improved outcomes for women compared with men is unknown.In the CADILLAC trial, 2082 patients (27% women) with AMI within 12 hours of symptom onset were randomized to balloon angioplasty (PTCA; n=518), PTCA+abciximab (n=528), stenting (n=512), and stenting+abciximab (n=524). As compared with men, women had a lower body surface area; had a greater prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia; experienced significant delays to treatment; and had better baseline and final TIMI grade 3 flows. Unadjusted 1-year event rates were higher for women, including death (7.6% versus 3.0%, P<0.001), ischemic target-vessel revascularization (TVR; 16.7% versus 12.1%, P=0.006), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE; 23.9% versus 15.3%, P<0.001). Female gender was an independent predictor of MACE and bleeding complications, although comorbid risk factors and body surface area but not gender predicted 1-year death. For women, primary stenting resulted in a reduction in 1-year MACE from 28.1% to 19.1% (P=0.01) and in ischemic TVR from 20.4% to 10.8% (P=0.002) compared with PTCA. The addition of abciximab to primary stenting significantly reduced the 30-day ischemic TVR without increasing bleeding or stroke rates.The higher mortality rate in women compared with men after interventional treatment for AMI may be explained by differences in body size and clinical risk factors, although female gender remains an important independent determinant of overall adverse outcomes. For women in the CADILLAC trial, the addition of abciximab reduced 30-day TVR without increasing bleeding risk, and primary stenting reduced 1-year TVR and MACE rates compared with PTCA."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"The cardioprotective effects of short-term exercise against myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury in male and female rats were examined. We subjected male and female rats to 0 (Sed; n = 8 males and 8 females), 1 (1 day; n = 10 males and 8 females), or 5 (5 day; n = 6 males and 6 females) days of treadmill running. Langendorff-perfused hearts underwent 1 h of regional ischaemia and 2 h of reperfusion, and infarct size (expressed as a percentage of the zone at risk; ZAR), left ventricular pressure development, and coronary flow were measured for each heart. Preischaemic pressure development and coronary flow did not differ between the sexes nor were they influenced by exercise. Sed females had significantly smaller infarct sizes (25 +/- 3%) than Sed male hearts (37 +/- 3%; P < 0.001). Short-term running significantly reduced infarct size following 1 day (27 +/- 3%; P < 0.05) and 5 days (30 +/- 4%; P < 0.10) of exercise in males. One day of running did not reduce infarct size in females (19 +/- 3%; P = NS), but 5 day females did show a significant reduction in infarct size (13 +/- 2%; P < 0.05). There was no relationship between postischaemic coronary vascular hyperaemia and infarct size across sexes or exercise training groups. Hearts from Sed females exhibited significantly higher manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protein expression than hearts from Sed males, but short-term exercise (neither 1 nor 5 days) did not alter MnSOD protein in either sex. Increased sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel subunit protein expression (SUR2A and/or K(ir)6.2) correlated closely with sex-dependent and exercise-acquired protection against myocardial infarction. These data indicate that: (1) sex-dependent and exercise-induced differences in the susceptibility of the heart to ischaemia-reperfusion injury are not associated with improved coronary flow or postischaemic hyperaemia; (2) increased MnSOD protein expression is not necessary for exercise-induced protection from infarction; and (3) one possible mechanism for sex-dependent and exercise-mediated reductions in infarct size involves an increased protein expression of cardiac sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"To study whether the degree of carotid atherosclerosis and the male predominance of echolucent plaques could explain the sex difference in myocardial infarction (MI) compared to angina pectoris (AP).Ultrasound examination of the carotid artery was performed in 6727 persons. The presence of plaque, plaque thickness and number of segments with plaque were recorded. Plaque morphology in terms of echogenicity was scored as echolucent (soft plaque) or echogenic (hard plaque). A questionnaire was used to obtain information about coronary heart disease.In men with the most advanced atherosclerosis, the risk (OR, 95% CI) of having MI compared to those with no carotid atherosclerosis was less than half as the corresponding risk in women (2.2, 1.4-3.3 vs 5.3, 2.6-10.6). For MI, the male-to-female ratio was highest in the group with no carotid plaque and declined by increasing burden of atherosclerosis. For AP, the sex ratio was independent of the degree of atherosclerosis.The findings support the hypothesis that the sex difference in MI compared to AP is due to the higher male prevalence of echolucent plaque."mycardial	Outcomes	"To determine the significance of sex in one-year prognosis of death from ischemic heart disease after a first-ever myocardial infarction.Kaunas men and women aged 25-64 years and admitted to the hospitals of Kaunas due to a first-ever myocardial infarction during 1983-1992, and with a first coded electrocardiogram were enrolled into the study. Electrocardiograms were analyzed using the criteria of the Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) Project of World Health Organization (WHO) and the Minnesota Code. The Kaunas ischemic heart disease register was a source of data.Women with a Q-wave or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction were older; they had anterior localization of myocardial infarction, a history of diabetes and obesity more frequently than men. Myocardial infarction was more often complicated by atrial flutter or fibrillation (p=0.02) in women with Q-wave myocardial infarction than in men, and women with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction more frequently had history of hypertension than men (p=0.00). One-year mortality after a myocardial infarction was significantly higher in women with Q-wave myocardial infarction than in women with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (p=0.03). There was no difference in odds to die during a first year after myocardial infarction with or without Q-wave between women and men neither in univariate nor in multivariate analysis.Women aged 25 to 64 years had similar crude risk of dying during one year after initial myocardial infarction compared with men of the same age group. There were no statistically significant differences between men and women with Q-wave or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction after adjustment for potential confounders."mycardial	Outcomes	"Women experience higher levels of distress than men (depression, anxiety, poor quality of life) after a first myocardial infarction. Sex differences in distress are not present in predominantly female diseases such as arthritis. This study explored the possibility that the predominantly male treatment environment for heart disease accounted for some of the sex differences in distress.Men and women who had experienced a first-MI were asked to complete the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), a modified version of the Moos Ward Atmosphere Scale (WAS) and measures of illness intrusiveness, depression, anxiety and quality of life. Gender syntony was defined as a match between patient gender (BSRI) and the perceived gender of the treatment environment (WAS).Women experienced higher levels of distress than men and were more likely to experience discordance between their gender and the perceived gender of the care environment (73% of women versus 32% of men). The presence of gender dystony (a mismatch between gender and treatment environment) was related to higher levels of illness intrusiveness and overall distress.Modification of the heart disease treatment environment so that it better meets the needs of women may reduce sex differences in distress."mycardial	Outcomes	"Attributions for myocardial infarction were studied in a patient sample (N = 157). Men and women were comparable at intake on age, health status, and lifestyle factors. Attributions to diet, chi2 (1, N = 157) = 8.83, p = .003, and exercise, chi2 (1, N = 157) = 6.60, p = .01, were less common among women than men. After 3 months (n = 136), women were less likely than men to report improving their diets or increasing exercise. Initial attributions predicted subsequent reports of behavior change in relevant domains. These findings suggest that gender differences in causal attributions for myocardial infarction may contribute to subsequent differences between men and women in health-related behavior change."mycardial	Outcomes	"This study examined functional capacity and hemodynamic responses to exercise in men and women during early recovery after myocardial infarction (MI). Participants were tested at hospital discharge and six weeks following discharge. At each testing time, they completed the Beck Depression Inventory and a symptom-limited graded exercise test (SL-GXT). Functional capacity, expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs), was estimated from performance on the SL-GXT. Hemodynamic response measures included heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP). and rate-pressure product (RPP). Both men and women demonstrated significant increases in functional capacity from discharge to six weeks later although the levels were lower for women (M = 2.8 METs) than men (M = 7.3 METs). This indicates a need for gender-sensitive counselling for unsupervised exercise rehabilitation during early recovery following MI."mycardial	Management	"Coronary heart disease (CHD) has been socially constructed as a gender-specific disease, with women seen not to be at risk (Lockyer, 2002). This is despite CHD being the leading cause of mortality in both men and women in the Western world (DH, 2004). The aim of this research was to explore the illness perceptions of a sample of women following acute myocardial infarction (MI). Relationships between illness perceptions and adoption of health-promoting behaviours, and attendance at a programme of cardiac rehabilitation were explored. The influence of age was also considered. Leventhal and Nerenz' Self- Regulatory Model of Illness Behaviour (1985) was used as the theoretical framework. This model consists of three stages: interpretation of symptoms, coping and appraisal. A qualitative research design was used. A purposeful sample of 10 women was selected on the basis of age and decision to attend cardiac rehabilitation. Data were collected by semi-structured interview, 3 months following the acute infarct, and analysed thematically. Stress was considered to be the cause of the MI, and although lifestyle factors were recognized, their significance was uncertain; perhaps as a result, lifestyle changes were limited. Overall, women had a perceived lack of control over the illness. The decision to attend a cardiac rehabilitation programme was influenced by beliefs relating to the identification of a known cause and level of perceived control of the illness. A belief that the illness was inevitable seemed to be more prevalent in older aged women. These findings have implications for health service providers in that they suggest that illness perceptions need to be explored and addressed before the decision to attend a programme of cardiac rehabilitation is made and health-promoting behaviours adopted."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"There are conflicting data about gender differences in cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI), including cardiac rupture and mortality. Using a mouse model of MI, we recently found that the cardiac rupture rate during the first week after MI was significantly lower in females than in males, suggesting that females have attenuated structural remodeling. Thus in this study, we attempted to determine whether: a) females have attenuated remodeling and faster healing during the early phase post-MI, and b) females have better cardiac function and outcome during the chronic phase compared to males. MI was induced in 12-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice. Signs of early remodeling, including cardiac rupture, infarct expansion, inflammatory response, and collagen deposition, were studied during the first 2 weeks post-MI. Left ventricular remodeling and function were followed for 12 weeks post-MI. We found that males had a higher rate of cardiac rupture, occurring mainly at 3 to 5 days of MI and associated with a higher infarct expansion index. Neutrophil infiltration at the infarct border was more pronounced in males than females during the first days of MI, which were also characterized by increased MMP activity. However, the number of infiltrating macrophages was significantly higher in females at day 4. During the chronic phase post-MI, males had significantly poorer LV function, more prominent dilatation and significant myocyte hypertrophy compared to females. In conclusion, males have delayed myocardial healing, resulting in cardiac rupture, and the survivors have poorer cardiac function and pronounced maladaptive remodeling, whereas females show a better outcome during the development of HF."mycardial	Management	"To test whether women receive less intensive treatment and fewer risk stratification tests following acute myocardial infarction (MI), than men.A retrospective study of medical records in all district general hospitals and tertiary referral centres for cardiology in Wales was performed. Patients (n = 1595, of which 989 were men) admitted to hospital over 4 months with a diagnosis of acute MI had their case notes reviewed for treatment, stratification of risk factors and secondary prevention. Data were analysed for differences in treatment between men and women and whether these could be attributed to age at presentation.Women were older than men at presentation [mean age 75 (SD 11) versus 66 (12) years, p < 0.01]; fewer women received thrombolysis (34 versus 44 per cent) and low molecular weight heparin (63 versus 71 per cent) (both p < 0.001); and women had higher 30 day mortality (28 versus 17 per cent, p < 0.001). Fewer women received cardiac catheterization, investigations to identify high risk, drugs for secondary prevention on discharge and referral to cardiac rehabilitation. However, intensities of treatment, investigation and secondary prevention were strongly related to age and, after adjusting for age, gender differences remained only for thrombolysis and exercise testing.Although women receive fewer investigations and treatments than men, this potential gender bias can be explained by age. The lower use of treatment and investigation among older patients draws attention to the lack of direct evidence of effectiveness for these patients. Further studies are needed to confirm effectiveness of investigations and treatments in older patients."mycardial	Outcomes	"The type of acute coronary syndrome may account for different prognoses between men and women after myocardial infarction. This study assessed gender differences in 28-day mortality rates for first or recurrent Q-wave and non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions and unstable angina by using data from 5 registries that included 20,836 patients (24.8% women). Mortality rates were higher in women with first Q-wave myocardial infarction but not in the other patients after adjusting for confounding variables."mycardial	Outcomes	"Psychosocial factors have been suggested as risk factors for atherosclerotic disease.The purpose of the present study was to examine whether there is a gender difference in quality of life after a myocardial infarction with modem treatment of acute ischemic heart disease.In all, 123 men and women aged between 31 and 80 years, and with a hospital-diagnosed myocardial infarction occurring 1-12 months prior to inclusion, were studied. Minor symptoms evaluation profile (MSEP) was used to estimate quality of life at entry.Age, hemodynamic data, smoking habits, as well as laboratory data, concomitant cardiovascular disease, and revascularization rate did not differ between men and women. Women had significantly more negative feelings regarding all the estimated dimensions of quality of life (Contentment, Vitality, and Sleep) than did men.Self-assessed quality of life after a myocardial infarction was significantly lower among women than among men despite similar age, treatment, and hemodynamic and laboratory data. The causal relationship is however, not known. Further studies are needed to evaluate the underlying mechanism of this observation. This may lead to the development of novel treatment strategies in female patients after a myocardial infarction."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"In this association study the authors compared the insertion/deletion (I/D) angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism in females and males with premature myocardial infarction (MI). I/D ACE gene polymorphism was tested in 738 subjects: 302 patients with MI (151 men and 151 women) and 436 healthy subjects (207 men and 229 women). In women the ACE-DD genotype was not associated with MI (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-2.1, p=0.6), whereas the ACE-DD genotype conferred a 2-fold independent risk for MI in men (95% CI=1.2-3.4; p=0.013) after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. The authors found evidence for the sex difference in the effect of the ACE-DD genotype on MI risk. The ACE-DD genotype conferred a 2-fold independent risk for premature MI in males."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To determine the ethnic variation of short and long term female vulnerability after an acute coronary event in a population of Chinese, Indians, and Malays.Population based registry.Residents of Singapore between the ages of 20-64 years with coronary events. Case identification and classification procedures were modified from the MONICA (monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease) project.Adjusted 28 day case fatality and long term mortality.From 1991 to 1999, there were 16 320 acute coronary events, including 3497 women. Age adjusted 28 day case fatality was greater in women (51.5% v 38.6%, p < 0.001), with a larger sex difference evident among younger Malay patients. This inequality between the sexes was observed in both the pre-hospitalisation and post-admission periods. Among hospitalised patients, women were older, were less likely to have suffered from a previous Q wave or anterior wall myocardial infarction, and had lower peak creatine kinase concentrations. Case fatality was higher among women, with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43 to 1.88) and 1.50 (95% CI 1.37 to 1.64) for 28 day and mean four year follow up periods. There were significant interactions of sex and age with ethnic group (p = 0.017). The adjusted hazards for mortality among Chinese, Indian, and Malay women versus men were 1.30, 1.71, and 1.96, respectively. The excess mortality among women diminished with age.In this multiethnic population, both pre-hospitalisation and post-admission case fatality rates were substantially higher among women. The sex discrepancy in long term mortality was greatest among Malays and in the younger age groups."mycardial	Outcomes	"There is conflicting information about gender differences in clinical features, management and outcome after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The objective of the study was to compare the baseline characteristics, management and 30-day mortality of AMI in men and women in Estonia.This study included consecutive unselected patients from the Myocardial Infarction Registry (MIR) in Estonia, who were admitted to a university hospital between January 2001 and February 2002. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95 percent confidence intervals (95% CI).The study included 228 men and 167 women. Women were older than men (73.49 +/- 10.95 vs. 65.63 +/- 12.60, p < 0.000), and had more comorbidities. After age-adjustment, the higher prevalence of comorbidities, like diabetes (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.48, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.45-4.24), hypertension (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.15-2.76) and history of congestive heart failure (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.32-3.46) in women was preserved. Women were more frequently treated with diuretics (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.69-4.25) and less frequently with statins (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.96), after age-adjustment. Although thrombolytic therapy, coronary angiography and angioplasty were performed less frequently in women, these differences disappeared after age-adjustment. Female gender was not an independent predictor of 30-day mortality after AMI, crude OR was 1.39, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.41, adjustment for age and other covariates reduced OR to 0.98, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.20.Among AMI-patients, age but not gender is an important determinant of care and early mortality."mycardial	Management	"Previous studies have indicated that sex differences may exist in the pharmacological management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), with female patients being treated less aggressively.To determine if previously reported sex differences in AMI medication use were also evident among all AMI patients treated at hospitals in an urban Canadian city.All patients who had a primary discharge diagnosis of AMI from all three adult care hospitals in Calgary, Alberta, in the 1998/1999 fiscal year were identified from hospital administrative records (n=914). A standardized, detailed chart review was conducted. Information collected from the medical charts included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, comorbid conditions, and cardiovascular medication use during hospitalization and at discharge.Similar proportions of female and male patients were treated with thrombolytics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, nitrate, heparin, diuretics and digoxin. Among patients aged 75 years and over, a smaller proportion of female patients received acetylsalicylic acid in hospital than did male patients (87% versus 95%; P=0.026). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that, after correction for age, use of other anticoagulants/antiplatelets and death within 24 h of admission, sex was no longer an independent predictor for receipt of acetylsalicylic acid in hospital. Medications prescribed at discharge were similar between male and female patients.The results from this Canadian chart review study, derived from detailed clinical data, indicate that the pattern of pharmacological treatment of female and male AMI patients during hospitalization and at discharge was very similar. No sex differences were evident in the treatment of AMI among patients treated in an urban Canadian centre."mycardial	Review	"Heart failure appears to be less common and less severe in females, and elderly women have a better overall survival after myocardial infarction than males and also a decreased risk of arrhythmic death. Human and animal studies also show that females display more favorable cardiac remodeling in several experimental and clinical conditions. However, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms have not been established, even though estrogens, beta-adrenergic stimulation, the renin-angiotensin system, and a greater resistance to myocardiocyte apoptosis in females have been proposed as hypothetical contributing factors. Indeed, epidemiologic, experimental and clinical evidence of gender differences in myocardial remodeling and heart failure favoring women could prompt the use of female myocardial progenitor or stem cells for cellular replacement therapy in cardiac failure, on the premises of a greater protection from myocardial apoptosis and unfavorable remodeling in women."mycardial	Management	"Symptom attributions were contrasted between male and female myocardial infarction victims (N = 157) who were comparable on age, cardiac risk status, medical history, symptom presentation, and other variables. Women were less likely than men to attribute their prehospital symptoms to cardiac causes. In the context of hearing symptom attributions or advice from support persons, women were less likely than men to report receiving a cardiac attribution or advice to seek medical attention. Results have implications for how victim gender influences the lay interpretation of cardiac symptoms."mycardial	Outcomes	"This prospective study examined sex differences in illness intrusiveness and in baseline predictors of illness intrusiveness in cardiac patients' 1-year postcardiac event.Patients diagnosed with a myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina (UA) completed a baseline questionnaire during their hospitalization (139 men and 104 women). Eighty-one men and 67 women completed the follow-up questionnaire 1-year postcardiac event. The questionnaire included measures of illness intrusiveness in three life domains, depressive symptomatology, social support, medical information, risk factors for heart disease, and sociodemographic information.A MANCOVA with the three Illness Intrusiveness subscales as dependent variables, sex as the between-group factor, and partnership status as a covariate found a sex effect for the Intimacy subscale, but not for the Instrumental and the Relationships/Personal Development subscales. Men reported more intrusiveness in the Intimacy domain of their life as compared to women. After controlling for sociodemographic factors and risk factors for heart disease, hierarchical regressions indicated sex differences in baseline predictors of 1-year follow-up illness intrusiveness in the three life domains. For men, being satisfied with support from partner at baseline was associated with less intrusiveness in the Instrumental Life domain 1 year after the cardiac event. For women, surprisingly, more satisfaction with support from their partner at baseline was associated with more intrusiveness in their intimate lives 1 year after their cardiac event. In addition, emotional symptoms of depression at baseline were predictive of increased illness intrusiveness in Relationship/Personal Development and Intimacy domains for men and in Instrumental and Intimacy domains for women.Support from partner may have a differential impact for men and women after a cardiac event. Depressive symptomatology during initial hospitalization, particularly emotional symptoms, is a prominent indicator of illness intrusiveness for both sexes 1 year after the cardiac event."mycardial	Management	"Direct angioplasty (PTCA) and thrombolytic therapy are the chief therapies for treating an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI).This study was designed to evaluate sex differences in the relative benefit of direct PTCA versus thrombolytic therapy among patients enrolled in the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries in Acute Coronary Syndromes Angioplasty (GUSTO II-B PTCA) Substudy.Women and men presenting with an acute ST-segment elevation MI were randomized to receive either direct PTCA or accelerated tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Patients were then randomized to treatment with either heparin or bivalirudin. A gender analysis of outcome was performed.Women were older than men (68.6 +/- 11.5 vs 59.5 +/- 12.0 years, P <.001) and were more likely to have diabetes (22.5% vs 13.5%, P <.0001) and hypertension (53.3% vs 34.8%, P =.001). After adjusting for differences in baseline variables, the odds ratio (OR) for reaching a 30-day clinical end point (death, nonfatal infarction, or nonfatal disabling stroke) was similar for women and men (1.35, 95% CI 0.88-2.08). The OR for reaching a clinical end point at 30 days for the PTCA-treated women compared with the t-PA-treated women was 0.685 (95% CI 0.36-1.32) and similar to the OR in men, 0.565 (95% CI 0.35-0.91), P for interaction =.535. Because women had a higher event rate than men, the absolute number of major events prevented when treating women with direct PTCA was higher than men (56 events/1000 women treated with PTCA vs 42 events per 1000 men treated with PTCA).Although the relative benefit of direct PTCA to t-PA for the treatment of an acute MI appears to be similar in women and men, women may derive a larger absolute benefit from direct PTCA."mycardial	Management	"The problem of a possible gender bias in coronary heart disease management is still controversial. We studied gender differences in secondary preventive drug prescriptions and in referral to cardiac rehabilitation after acute coronary events in France.An observational survey was carried out in 1998-1999 in 150 French intensive cardiac care units. A sample of 2626 consecutive patients admitted for myocardial infarction or unstable angina and alive at discharge was included. Data were retrospectively collected from medical records after discharge.The sample was composed of 1921 men and 705 women. At discharge, antiplatelet agents were prescribed in 93.4% of men and 91.5% of women (p=0.09), beta-blockers in 73.4% and 63.7% (p<0.0001), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in 39.9% and 44.3% (p<0.05), and statins in 47.0% and 40.7% (p<0.01). The percentage of subjects referred to a cardiac rehabilitation program at discharge was 26.2% in men and 15.5% in women (p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, taking into account confounding factors, gender did not appear as an independent determinant of drug prescriptions. Conversely, being a woman was independently associated with a lower probability to be referred to a cardiac rehabilitation program at discharge (adjusted female-to-male odds ratio: 0.44 (95% confidence interval: [0.31-0.64], p<0.0001).In this study, gender was not an independent determinant of secondary preventive drug prescriptions after acute coronary events. Conversely, we found a gender bias in referral to cardiac rehabilitation programs at discharge."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To explain the stronger effect of type 2 diabetes on the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in women compared with men.The study population consisted of 1,296 nondiabetic subjects and 835 type 2 diabetic subjects aged 45-64 years without cardiovascular disease. The end points were CHD death and a major CHD event (CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction). The follow-up time was 13 years.Major CHD event rate per 1,000 person-years was 11.6 in nondiabetic men, 1.8 in nondiabetic women, 36.3 in diabetic men, and 31.6 in diabetic women. The diabetes-related hazard ratio for a major CHD event from the Cox model, adjusted for age and area of residence, was 2.9 (95% CI 2.2-3.9) in men and 14.4 (8.4-24.5) in women, and after further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, 2.8 (2.0-3.7) and 9.5 (5.5-16.9), respectively. The burden of conventional risk factors in the presence of diabetes was greater in women than in men at baseline. Prospectively, elevated blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol, and high triglycerides contributed to diabetes-related CHD risk more in women than in men. However, after adjusting for conventional risk factors, a substantial proportion of diabetes-related CHD risk remained unexplained in both genders.The stronger effect of type 2 diabetes on the risk of CHD in women compared with men was in part explained by a heavier risk factor burden and a greater effect of blood pressure and atherogenic dyslipidemia in diabetic women."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in adult patients under the age of 45 is relatively unusual. Recent studies have shown a higher prevalence of AMI in young South Asian migrants. Data on South Asians in South Asia on cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients is lacking. The purpose of this study is to look at the classical risk factors of coronary artery disease (CAD) in young men and women and their older counterparts who presented to the emergency service of the Aga Khan university hospital (AKUH) and were diagnosed with AMI.976 consecutive patients admitted to AKUH with AMI between January 2000-December 2002 were divided into two groups: < 45 years (young) and > 45 years (old). Demographic factors, clinical symptoms and presence of risk factors for CAD were recorded with the help of pre-tested data extraction forms.Young patients represented 16.1% of all patients with AMI. 93.1% of the young patients were men. Young male patients were more likely to be smokers and have high cholesterol levels as compared to their young female counterparts. Young AMI patients when compared to old AMI patients, were more likely to have hypertension, positive family history of coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, high LDL and high triglycerides.In this study, the risk factor profile between young and old patients and between the two genders was found to be different. Thus adult management protocols for AMI should be different from the ones for older patients and gender difference should also be considered."mycardial	Review	"Our objectives were to document the preoperative and postoperative functional status of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, to examine factors that influence functional recovery, and to determine whether gender differences exist in the preoperative and postoperative functional status with the Duke Activity Status Index.One thousand eight hundred twenty-five patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting had baseline and follow-up quality-of-life surveys. Mean follow-up from baseline to postoperative Duke Activity Status Index was 8.0 months for women and men. The influence of 47 variables, in addition to baseline scores on postoperative functional status, was examined with logistic ordinal modeling. An ordinal model for the follow-up score was determined by means of backward selection, with variables retained if they satisfied the criterion of a P value of less than.05.Median baseline Duke Activity Status Index scores (women, 21.5; men, 32.2; P <.001) and first follow-up scores (women, 42.7; men, 58.2; P <.001) were lower in women than in men. Patients who were older and those who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes, vascular disease, postoperative serious infection, and return to the operating room had lower postoperative scores. After adjusting for these factors, women still had lower follow-up scores (odds ratio for men, 2.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.7-2.6]; P <.001).A number of preoperative factors, operative variables, and postoperative events are associated with functional recovery after coronary revascularization. In addition, female gender is associated with more postoperative functional impairment after adjusting for these perioperative variables."mycardial	Management	"Ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure are common and important conditions in family practice. Effective treatments may be underutilized, particularly in women and the elderly. The objective of the study was to determine the rate of prescribing of evidence-based cardiovascular medications and determine if these differed by patient age or sex.We conducted a two-year cross-sectional study involving all hospitals in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. Subjects were all patients admitted with ischaemic heart disease with or without congestive heart failure between 15 October 1997 and 14 October 1999. The main measure was the previous outpatient use of recommended medications. Chi-square analyses followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine age-sex differences.Usage of recommended medications varied from approximately 60% for beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to 90% for antihypertensive agents. Patients aged 75 and over were significantly less likely than younger patients to be taking any of the medication classes. Following adjustment for age, there were no significant differences in medication use by sex except among women aged 75 and older who were more likely to be taking beta-blockers than men in the same age group.The use of evidence-based cardiovascular medications is rising and perhaps approaching reasonable levels for some drug classes. Family physicians should ensure that all eligible patients (prior myocardial infarction, congestive failure) are offered beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors."mycardial	Clinical	"To investigate sex differences in clinical presentation in younger and older patients hospitalised with a wide spectrum of acute coronary syndromes (ACS).We analysed 10253 patients with a discharge diagnosis of ACS in the Euro Heart Survey of patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes. There were 1010 women and 3709 men < 65 years. Among patients <65 years, fewer women than men presented with ST elevation, (OR [odds ratio]: 0.62 [0.53-0.71]) and developed Q-wave myocardial infarction (OR 0.58 [0.50-0.67]), whereas in patients > or =65 years there was no significant sex difference. Women <65 years were more likely than men of the same age to be discharged with a diagnosis of unstable angina (OR 1.56 [1.35-1.79]), but there was no sex difference in older patients; the p for interaction between sex and age for both was <0.0001. Among patients who underwent coronary angiography, both younger and older women were less likely than men to have 3-vessel or main stem disease. In a logistic regression analysis stratified for age, female sex was a significant negative determinant of presenting with ST elevation in patients <65 years (OR 0.68 [0.58-0.79]), whereas there was no effect of sex in patients > or =65 years.In younger patients with ACS, women were less likely than men to present with ST elevation and more likely to be discharged with a diagnosis of unstable angina. In older patients there were no differences in clinical presentation. Both older and younger women had less extensive atherosclerosis. The findings suggest a different pathophysiology of ACS in younger, but not older, women."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"We developed myocardial infarction-prone rabbits (WHHLMI rabbits) by selectively breeding coronary atherosclerosis-prone WHHL rabbits. To examine the serum/plasma biochemical parameters of this animal model, we assayed the lipid and glucose levels, and enzyme activities of WHHLMI rabbits from 2 to 26 months of age using solid phase analysis. The results showed a good correlation with those measured with a conventional method. The serum enzyme activities and lipid levels varied with aging despite almost no change in the plasma glucose levels. Gender differences were observed in the total cholesterol, triglyceride, and lactate dehydrogenase activity levels. The data on these serum/plasma biochemical parameters will be useful in studies of myocardial infarction or pharmacological studies using this model."mycardial	Review	"Cardiovascular disease is currently the leading cause of death in women in the United States, but many women underestimate this risk. The treatment of coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has increased steadily in the past decade, but women referred for PCI have a different profile of demographic features and clinical presentation than do their male counterparts. Concern has been raised about sex discrepancy in referral of women for invasive cardiology procedures. This may have resulted from the outcomes of initial studies of balloon angioplasty, which demonstrated decreased success and increased risk of angioplasty in women compared with men. However, more recent data have shown no sex difference in outcomes with contemporary PCI practices. Additionally, primary PCI for acute myocardial infarction in women is associated with improved mortality in women when compared to thrombolytic therapy. This review will examine the sex differences in demographics and outcomes of women undergoing PCI."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Very few studies indicating that low-moderate alcohol consumption protects from myocardial infarction (MI) controlled for social support and working conditions, which could confound the findings. Therefore, a first aim was to study the risk of non-fatal and total MI in relation to volume of alcohol consumption and measures of social support and working conditions. A second aim was to analyse the impact of the volume of earlier alcohol use in abstainers.Data came from a case-control study, the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program (SHEEP), including first MI among Swedish citizens 45-70 years old.Stockholm County 1992-94.There were 1095 cases of MI in men and 471 in women (928 and 372 were non-fatal), and 2339 living controls from the general population.Information about alcohol use at different periods in life and job strain, social anchorage and life control besides pre-existing health problems, smoking, physical activity, socio-economic status and marital status was obtained by a questionnaire from the cases and the controls.In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the relative risk for MI (especially non-fatal) was reduced among alcohol consumers. RR for non-fatal MI was 0.52 (95% confidence intervals 0.32, 0.85) in men with a consumption of 50-69.9 g 100% ethanol/day and 0.21 (95% confidence interval 0.06, 0.77) in women with a consumption of 30 g or more per day (reference category 0.1-5 g 100% ethanol/day). Men who were abstainers during the previous 1-10 years and with an earlier average consumption of 5-30 g 100% ethanol/day had a significantly lower relative risk compared to such abstainers with an earlier higher consumption. Earlier consumption among abstainers may also have an impact on gender differences in MI. Analyses showed positive interaction between abstention and low life-control in women, but only 4% of the female cases were due to this interaction. There were no other interactions between measures of alcohol use and social anchorage, life control and working situations.Alcohol use had a protective impact on MI, with little impact of job strain, social anchorage and life control, giving increased support for a protective impact of low-moderate alcohol use. The level of previous alcohol consumption among male 1-10-year-long abstainers influenced the risk of MI."mycardial	Management	"Almost 62 million Americans have one or more types of cardiovascular disease and, of these, more than 32 million are female. This translates into an average of 1 in 5 women, making cardiovascular disease the leading killer of women in the U.S., responsible for more than half a million deaths a year. While it has been known for some time that differences exist between the sexes regarding coronary heart disease, it has only been in the last 10 years that these disparities in incidence, morbidity, mortality, risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment have been explored. Research has shown a gap in the utilization of medical therapy, diagnostic studies, and revascularization procedures involving women. In addition, women s outcomes after myocardial infarction have been consistently demonstrated to be poorer than those of men. Another important issue that has just started to be addressed is that the predominantly male-focused cardiovascular research has been generalized to women. Only in recent years have women been included in clinical trials or databases in sufficient numbers for sex-based analysis of the data. The topic of cardiovascular disease in women is diverse and complex. In this article, some of the important issues will be introduced and discussed, highlight our current understanding of the problem and to emphasize the areas in which further study and progress is needed. These issues include the epidemiology of coronary heart disease, the diagnosis of coronary heart disease, the medical therapy of acute coronary syndromes, coronary revascularization, and hormone replacement therapy."mycardial	Management	"This study seeks to explore gender-relevant factors of medical history, sociodemographics, symptom presentation, and delay on thrombolysis administration (or recorded contraindication) in a sample of men and women with confirmed myocardial infarction (MI).Cross-sectional examination of self and nurse-report data collected in the coronary care unit (CCU) from 12 hospitals across south-central Ontario, Canada. A total of 482 MI patients (347 males, 135 females; 63% response rate) were recruited.There was no gender difference in the report of chest pain (chi(2)(1) = 3.78, p =.052), or in prehospital delay time (median = 96.5 minutes). Thrombolysis was administered in 158 males (68.4%) and 50 females (50.0%) without reported contraindication. Females (median = 27 minutes) had a significantly longer interval between diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) and administration of a thrombolytic than males (median = 22, U = 3,056). No contraindication was indicated for not administering a thrombolytic (i.e., too late, risk of bleed) in approximately 40% of females. In accordance with clinical practice guidelines, thrombolysis was more often administered in participants with a shorter time interval between symptom onset and hospital arrival. For females, thrombolysis was more often administered in younger participants (Kruskal Wallis = 5.88).Reducing gender, age, and socioeconomic disparities in access to thrombolysis treatment is imperative. Hospital delays with female cardiac patients may be precluding thrombolysis administration."mycardial	Outcomes	"Patient sex has been shown to differentially affect mortality from unstable angina (UA) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, to our knowledge, no prior population-based studies have examined both cohorts simultaneously to explain this intriguing variation. Hence, we undertook to explore and explain sex differences in 5-year mortality after UA and AMI.We used an administrative database of 22 967 patients with AMI and 8441 patients with UA discharged from acute care hospitals in Alberta between April 1, 1993, and March 31, 2000.Women were older with more baseline comorbidities, more frequently had a diagnosis of UA, and had 30% lower relative odds of undergoing revascularization than men. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 5-year mortality were similar between sexes after UA (women vs men, 21.6% vs 19.5%; P =.09) but markedly higher for women after AMI (38.5% vs 26.6%, P<.001). After adjustment for baseline characteristics and revascularization, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for women vs men were 0.81 (0.72-0.92) after UA and 0.99 (0.93-1.05) after AMI. Only women younger than 65 years were at a significantly higher risk after AMI. The reasons for this difference in sex-related outcomes between UA and AMI may relate to greater disparities in the AMI cohort with respect to age, comorbidities, neighborhood incomes, and referrals to cardiovascular specialists.Relative to UA, AMI has a more serious impact on women than men, such that women have a survival advantage when afflicted with UA but lose that advantage with AMI. Additional investigation into the causes, treatment, and policy implications of the age-sex interaction is warranted."mycardial	Outcomes	"Women with diabetes mellitus are at particularly high risk for coronary heart disease-related morbidity and mortality compared with men with diabetes mellitus. However, recent data comparing hospital and long-term outcomes in women with diabetes mellitus and men hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are scarce. The objectives of our multi-hospital observational study were to examine sex differences and temporal trends (1975-99) in hospital and long-term case-fatality rates (CFRs) in patients with diabetes mellitus and AMI from a population-based perspective.A community-wide study of residents of the Worcester, Mass, metropolitan area who were hospitalized with confirmed AMI was conducted. Data were collected in 12 1-year periods between 1975 and 1999. The study sample consisted of 1354 men and 1280 women with diabetes mellitus.Overall hospital CFRs were significantly greater for women with diabetes mellitus (21.3%) than for men with diabetes mellitus (14.9%). Between 1975 and 1999, hospital CFRs declined from 39.2% to 17.5% for women and from 18.9% to 9.5% in men. In examining long-term survival patterns for as long as 10 years after hospital discharge, there were no significant sex differences in long-term survival rates after adjustment for a limited number of known potentially confounding factors.Hospital death rates after AMI in men and women with diabetes mellitus have declined in the last 2 decades. The gap in hospital CFRs between men and women with diabetes mellitus has decreased considerably with time, although women have a higher risk of dying after AMI than men. Patients with diabetes mellitus continue to represent a high-risk group who will benefit from enhanced surveillance efforts and increased use of effective cardiac treatments."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Murine models are increasingly used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms contributing to left ventricular (LV) remodeling. Epidemiologic and animal studies have suggested that women undergo differing patterns of LV remodeling than men after myocardial infarction (MI). We, therefore, sought to compare LV remodeling after MI in male and female mice. Echocardiography was performed in male and female C57BL6 mice before and serially after MI. Two days after MI, end-diastolic LV internal diameter and shortening fraction were similar in males and females. Between days 2 and 28 after MI, LV internal diameter increased in male mice but remained unchanged in female mice. During this time period, shortening fraction declined in males, but not in females. Posterior wall thickness increased more in females than in males. The size of the MI and the LV mass/body weight were similar between the 2 sexes after MI. Echocardiography showed that after MI, female mice undergo less extensive LV remodeling than males, with less dilation and better preserved LV systolic function 28 days after MI. These sex differences should be taken into account when studying murine cardiac adaptation to MI."mycardial	Management	"Women with ischemic heart disease have poorer outcomes than men and are suggested to have greater risk associated with diabetes. We evaluated the prognosis associated with diabetes, in analyses stratified by sex, to determine whether similar differences are seen in a large unselected cohort of patients.Using the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcomes Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH), a clinical data collection and follow-up initiative capturing all patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in Alberta, Canada, the relative significance of diabetes on long-term survival in 13152 men and 4249 women was evaluated in patients presenting with or without myocardial infarction and according to first treatment received.The 1-year mortality rates were 4.7% and 6.8% in men and women (P < 0.001), 4.1% and 7.4% in nondiabetic and diabetic men (P < 0.001), and 5.8% and 9.6% in nondiabetic and diabetic women, respectively (P < 0.001). The risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios associated with diabetes in myocardial infarction were 1.03 in men and 1.20 in women. The diabetes hazard ratios for percutaneous coronary intervention were 1.28 in men and 1.40 in women, 1.23 in men and 1.32 in women for bypass surgery, and 1.26 in men and 1.31 in women for medical therapy (P = NS for all diabetes hazard ratio comparisons between men and women).Hazard ratios quantifying the adverse prognosis associated with diabetes in patients undergoing angiography are consistently higher among women than men, but the differences across sexes are not statistically significant. These slight sex differences noted in the APPROACH registry are similar to previously reported findings and may be clinically important."mycardial	Review	"The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge about gender differences in perceptions of coping and social support among patients who have experienced myocardial infarction.Women with coronary heart disease have physical, social and medical disadvantages compared with their male counterparts, which can influence their perception of recovery after cardiac events. No review has been found which focuses on gender differences in coping and social support in myocardial infarction patients.A computerized search was conducted using the keywords 'myocardial infarction', 'coping', 'gender differences' and 'social support'. Forty-one articles, published between 1990 and October 2002, were scrutinized.Two studies report that women used more coping strategies than men. Several qualitative studies found that women used a variety of coping strategies. Women minimized the impact of the disease, tended to delay in seeking treatment and did not want to bother others with their health problems. Household activities were important to them and aided their recovery. Men were more likely to involve their spouses in their recovery, and resuming work and keeping physically fit were important to them. Women tended to report that they had less social support up to 1 year after a myocardial infarction compared with men. They received less information about the disease and rehabilitation and experienced lack of belief in their heart problems from caregivers. Further, they received less assistance with household duties from informal caregivers. Men tended to report more support from their spouses than did women.Traditional gender-role patterns may influence the recovery of patients who have experienced myocardial infarction. Caregivers may need to be more sensitive to gender-specific needs with regard to risk profiles, social roles, and the patient's own role identity. For many women, especially older ones, household duties and family responsibilities may be an opportunity and a base for cardiac rehabilitation."mycardial	Management	"To analyse potential gender differences in cardiovascular risk factors and treatment patterns, reflecting clinical practice in secondary prevention.Observational national study during 3 years of patients eligible for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD).Fifty-two healthcare districts in Sweden, involving primary health care and hospitals in collaboration, participating in a national quality assurance programme for the prevention of CHD.A national sample of male and female patients surviving acute myocardial infarction, or following CABG/PTCA interventions for CHD, controlled at 3-6 months (n = 9135) and 12 months (n = 4802) of follow-up. The proportion of female patients (25%) did not differ between visits.Self-reported data on lifestyle, drug treatment and cardiovascular risk factor levels after consultation in general practice or at hospital policlinics.No major gender differences were recorded in risk factor levels or in cardiovascular drug treatment patterns at 12 months of follow-up. Female patients participated in educational programmes to improve lifestyle to a higher degree than males (52.0 vs 45.1%), but after 1 year were more often (p < 0.001) self-reported smokers (11.7 vs 8.4%). Female patients showed higher levels of blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, but not LDL cholesterol compared to male patients.In general, a gender-equal level of lipid control and access to medical drug treatment has been established for patients in secondary prevention from a national sample in Sweden, followed for 1 year after CHD manifestations and related interventions."mycardial	Management	"To examine age-specific gender differences and trends over time in the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Cross-sectional study of patients admitted with AMI from a community-wide perspective over a 10-year period (1990-1999).All hospitals in the Worcester (Mass) metropolitan area (1990 census = 437000).We identified 2037 women and 2645 men who were hospitalized in the Worcester metropolitan area with confirmed AMI during six 1-year periods between 1990 and 1999. Four age groups (<55, 55 to 64, 65 to 74 and >or=75 years) of men and women were studied.Use of echocardiography, exercise treadmill testing (ETT), cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) during the index hospitalization was examined in relation to age and gender. Overall, women were less likely to undergo ETT, cardiac catheterization, and CABG than were men, and these trends remained after controlling for potentially confounding factors. Between 1990 and 1999, there was a dramatic decrease in ETT, whereas the use of echocardiography remained unchanged. There were marked increases over time in the use of cardiac catheterization and PCI in women and men. Use of cardiac catheterization and PCI increased to a greater extent in women as compared to men. In patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, rates of coronary revascularization were similar between men and women.Our data suggest that women and men with AMI are treated differently with respect to use of diagnostic and revascularization procedures. However, gender differences in the use of these diagnostic and interventional approaches have narrowed over time."mycardial	Review	"Coronary heart disease is less common in premenopausal women compared to age-matched men. This difference disappears in the post-fertile years, and is presumably related to the reduced levels of female sex hormones, with subsequent metabolic and hemodynamic modifications. Ovarian exhaustion induces a more atherogenic lipid profile, which may partly explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease observed in post-fertile women as compared to age-matched fertile women. After the menopause, the combination of aging and estrogen deficiency negatively affects glucose metabolism. Diabetes mellitus blunts the beneficial condition associated with the female gender; furthermore, it increases the incidence of myocardial infarction, claudication and stroke in women more than in men. Finally, the unfavorable effects of menopause on the coronary risk seem to be mediated partly by changes in clotting and fibrinolytic factors."mycardial	Management	"To assess gender differences in patients with early reinfarction after fibrinolysis for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the impact of these differences on treatment and outcomes.We studied 3.7% of men (n=481) and 4.8% of women (n=189) with early reinfarction after fibrinolysis for AMI in the ASSENT-2 trial of 16,949 patients. Women with reinfarction were older and more often had hypertension, diabetes, and major bleeding prior to reinfarction. Despite adjustment for these differences, women with reinfarction were less likely to receive repeat fibrinolytic therapy (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37-0.84). Aggressive treatment by either repeat fibrinolysis or urgent revascularization was associated with reduced 1-year mortality irrespective of gender. Death within 24 h of reinfarction was more frequent in women and accounted for a greater proportion of their 1-year mortality (56.0 vs 34.8%; p=0.02). The excess mortality in women at 1 year (27.3 vs 19.9%; p=0.045) was eliminated after adjustment for gender differences in baseline risk profile.Women with early reinfarction following fibrinolysis for AMI had more frequent early death and were managed less aggressively. These findings suggest the need for increased awareness and timely intervention in these patients."mycardial	Outcomes	"Higher anxiety is linked to poorer outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), including increased in-hospital reinfarction and potentially life-threatening complications. If clinicians can identify patients at greatest risk for anxiety after AMI, they can institute early treatment. Previous research on the influence of gender on the incidence of anxiety post-AMI reflects inconsistent findings, and differences across cultures have not been studied. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to determine: 1) whether there are gender differences in anxiety in a diverse international sample of AMI patients, and 2) whether there was an interaction between gender and sociodemographic and clinical variables thought to influence anxiety.In this prospective, comparative study, 912 AMI patients were enrolled from Australia, South Korea, Japan, England, and the United States. Anxiety was assessed, using the Brief Symptom Inventory, within the first 72 hours of admission to the hospital for AMI symptoms.Women had higher anxiety levels than men (0.76 +/- 0.90 vs. 0.57 +/- 0.70, p =.005), and this pattern of higher anxiety in women was seen in each country studied. Neither sociodemographic nor clinical variables interacted with gender to influence anxiety.Across a variety of cultures, women have higher anxiety than men after AMI and this relationship is independent of age, education level, marital status, or presence of comorbidities or severity of AMI."mycardial	Outcomes	"The total cosine between R and T (TCRT) (angular difference between the spatial QRS and T wave loops) is a technical elaboration of the concept of ventricular gradient (VG), whose power as a risk stratifier in post-MI patients has already been demonstrated. Recently, it was reported that TCRT differed significantly between healthy men and women, which suggested that its predictive power might be gender dependent. The aim of the study was to investigate TCRT and its association with cardiac mortality in male and female survivors of acute MI. TCRT was measured from digital Frank orthogonal XYZ-lead ECGs recorded before hospital discharge in 681 survivors of acute MI (82% men, age: men 57.0 +/- 8.4 years, women 59.6 +/- 8.1 years, P = 0.002). During a follow-up censored at 5 years, cardiac mortality rates were 9.7% and 12.1% in men and women, respectively (P = 0.42). There were no significant difference in TCRT between men and women (-0.150 +/- 0.704 vs -0.070 +/- 0.731, P = 0.26). In univariate Cox regression analysis, TCRT < -0.88 was related to a 5-year cardiac mortality in men (relative risk [RR] 3.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.13-6.34, P = 1.9 x 10(-6)), and women (RR 5.16, 95% CI 1.83-14.56, P = 0.0015). Depressed TCRT was strongly associated with increased long-term cardiac mortality in survivors of acute MI. Its predictive power did not differ significantly between the sexes. The role of TCRT as a risk-stratifier in post-MI patients deserves further prospective assessment in multivariate models with established risk factors."mycardial	Management	"To determine if there are sex differences in the use of coronary revascularization in elderly patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and if sex differences vary by type of revascularization therapy.Retrospective analysis of medical record data.US acute-care nongovernment hospitals.A total of 66,830 Medicare patients > or =65 years old hospitalized with AMI.None.We assessed sex differences in the use of coronary revascularization within 60 days of hospital admission among patients who had undergone cardiac catheterization. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to derive risk-standardized rates of any coronary revascularization, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) adjusted for patient and hospital characteristics. Women had lower crude overall rates of coronary revascularization compared with men (65.2% vs 68.7%, p < 0.001). Multivariable adjustment reduced the sex difference in the overall coronary revascularization rate from 3.5 to 2.1% (66.0% women vs 68.1% men, p = 0.001). Sex differences in coronary revascularization use, however, varied by type of revascularization therapy. Women had lower risk-standardized rates of CABG surgery compared with men (27.0% vs 32.9%, p < 0.001), but had higher risk-standardized rates of PCI (42.0% vs 38.2%, p < 0.001), particularly among patients > 85 years old (45.8% vs 38.9%, p = 0.011).Among Medicare patients hospitalized with AMI, women are slightly less likely to undergo coronary revascularization after cardiac catheterization; however, sex differences in coronary revascularization vary by type of therapy."mycardial	Review	"Several though not all studies have found an up to 2-fold increase in 30-day mortality in women compared to men admitted to hospital for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI), even after adjustment for baseline variables. These data however do not take into account the pre-hospital period. Indeed, three large WHO MONICA reports that included out-of-hospital events found no significant gender difference in overall 28-day mortality from MI, with more men dying before reaching the hospital (presumably of ventricular tachyarrhythmias) and more women dying after hospital admission (presumably of heart failure). Women compared to men exhibit enhanced vagal activity, both under basal conditions and during angioplasty-induced coronary occlusion, and this may afford protection against malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Epidemiological data indicate that women dying of ischemic heart disease are less prone to sudden death than men. Taken together, the above findings suggest that, following acute MI, significant gender differences lie not so much in overall mortality, but in the timing and mechanisms of death."mycardial	Review	"Prior studies have reported significant gender differences in the procedural outcomes after elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Many of these differences have been explained by the presence of more comorbidities and worse clinical characteristics such as older age, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension in women than in men. Moreover, women have a smaller vessel diameter, more coronary tortuosity and different plaque composition compared to men that can lead to a higher dissection rate and a greater number of procedural complications. Although early data on PTCA suggested worse immediate results in women than in men, more recent data suggest that this difference is less marked. The introduction of stents with a low profile and a higher tractability and pushability has allowed the extensive application of these devices even in small and tortuous vessels improving the outcome of PTCA. This improvement has been higher in women than in men leading to the equalization of the immediate outcome in the two sexes, even if the baseline characteristics remain worse in women. In particular, mortality and the need for urgent surgical revascularization have become extremely low without any differences between sexes. However, some authors have still found a higher incidence of complications in the first period after the procedure due to stent thrombosis in the stenting era. For this reason, meticulous antiplatelet treatment should be prescribed and drugs such as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may also be considered advisable to reduce the excess risk in the female population particularly in women with prothrombotic risk factors such as diabetes. At 6 and 12 months similar rates of death, late myocardial infarction, and repeated revascularization have been shown in the two sexes. Coronary stenting and the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have also improved the immediate results in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing primary PTCA. Studies comparing the outcome differences between women and men with AMI and treated with primary PTCA are limited but all suggest that women benefit more than men from this procedure. The in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI is significantly higher in the female than in the male population with a higher incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in women among tissue-type plasminogen activator-treated patients. Vice versa, women and men have a similar or a slightly higher in-hospital mortality after primary PTCA without intracranial bleeding complications. For this reason, an earlier diagnosis of AMI, an earlier hospital admission and an earlier primary PTCA should be the aims of management in order to improve the outcome in women with AMI and to equalize the procedural results in the two sexes."mycardial	Outcomes	"This study sought to determine the impact of female gender on clinical outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS) due to predominant ventricular failure undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We analyzed gender-related differences in procedural, angiographic, and clinical outcomes in 208 consecutive patients with AMI complicated by CS. Out of 208 patients with CS, 65 were women and 143 men. Women were older than men (74 +/- 10 years vs. 66 +/- 12 years; P < 0.001) and had a greater incidence of a history of hypertension (43% vs. 29%; P = 0.041). The 6-month mortality rate was 42% in women and 31% in men (P = 0.157). There were no differences between groups in reinfarction rate and target vessel revascularization rate. Multivariate analysis showed age as the only variable independently related to the 6-month mortality, while female gender was not related to the risk of death. The benefit of early PCI is similar in women and men, and any potential referral bias in the use of PCI based on gender differences should be avoided."mycardial	Management	"The goal of this observational study was to examine overall and age-specific differences between women and men in the use of five beneficial cardiac medications in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) from a community-wide perspective. The objectives of our study were to determine whether women are treated differently than men and whether age acts as a potential effect modifier of any observed associations.A total of 2,461 women and 3,454 men with validated AMI comprised the study sample.Our study was an observational investigation of metropolitan Worcester (Mass., USA) residents who were hospitalized with initial AMI in all area hospitals during 12 1-year periods between 1975 and 1999. Four age-specific subgroups (<55, 55-64, 65-74 and > or =75 years) were studied.Differences in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering medications and thrombolytic agents during hospitalization for AMI were examined. The results of a multivariable regression analysis indicated that women were significantly less likely to receive aspirin and ACE inhibitors as compared to men. There were no significant gender differences in the prescribing of the other cardiac medications. Increasing age in both women and men was associated with a reduced likelihood of receiving effective cardiac therapies including aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering therapy and thrombolytic agents.These data suggest that the reasons for the marked age-related differences, in men and women, in the use of cardiac medications be more systematically explored. Previously observed gender differences in the management of patients with AMI essentially no longer exist."mycardial	Management	"Many studies have found that women are less likely than men to have cardiac catheterization after an acute myocardial infarction; however, it is unknown whether sex differences reflect inappropriate treatment.To ascertain whether cardiac catheterization use after acute myocardial infarction in men and women varied by sex and the appropriateness of the procedure, as determined by clinical guidelines.Retrospective analysis of chart-abstracted data.U.S. acute-care hospitals.143 444 Medicare patients who were hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction between 1994 and 1996.Cardiac catheterization use within 60 days of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction.Women had lower crude rates of cardiac catheterization than men (35.7% for women vs. 46.5% for men [ P < 0.001]; difference, 10.8 percentage points). Multivariable adjustment for demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics reduced most of the sex differences in procedure use (risk-standardized rates, 40.3% for women vs. 41.9% for men [ P < 0.001]; difference, 1.6 percentage points). Sex differences in cardiac catheterization use varied by the appropriateness of the procedure. Risk-standardized rates of cardiac catheterization were similar for men and women with strong indications for the procedure (44.1% for women vs. 44.6% for men [ P > 0.2]; difference, 0.5 percentage point). Rates of cardiac catheterization use among patients with weak indications did not significantly differ between men and women (16.5% for women vs. 18.0% for men [ P = 0.096]; difference, 1.5 percentage points). Sex differences in cardiac catheterization use were largest for patients with equivocal indications (39.4% for women vs. 42.5% for men [ P < 0.001]; difference, 3.1 percentage points).Among elderly persons, women have lower rates of cardiac catheterization use after an acute myocardial infarction than men. However, this difference was attenuated after multivariable adjustment, and it occurred primarily in patients with equivocal indications. We found no sex variations in procedure use among patients who had strong indications for cardiac catheterization."mycardial	Management	"In Germany and other countries a possibly lower programme attendance in cardiac rehabilitation of women compared to men has been critically discussed for many years. Up to now however there are only limited data related to gender-specific utilization rates and programme attendance. In a longitudinal study with three points of measurement, 496 men and 172 women after an acute myocardial infarction and their physicians were asked to complete questionnaires referring to different aspects of the medical and psychosocial situation as well as to provision of acute cardiac care and rehabilitation services. The results show that currently in Germany no gender differences exist in the use and provision of cardiac rehabilitation. Whether this apparently ""fair"" distribution in relation to gender can be seen as an adequate supply however is questionable in the context of different needs - especially with respect to the different psychosocial conditions of women and men."mycardial	Management	"The goal of this study was to determine whether women undergoing contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remain at increased risk in comparison with men and whether the outcomes in women have improved.Previous studies have shown that women treated with coronary angioplasty have a higher incidence of procedural morbidity and mortality than men.Gender differences in wave 1 of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Dynamic registry were evaluated. Baseline characteristics and outcomes in women in the Dynamic registry were compared with those in women in the 1985-1986 and 1993-1994 NHLBI Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) registries.Women were older with a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure, unstable angina and single vessel disease in comparison with men. Although procedural success and in-hospital death (2.2% vs. 1.3%), myocardial infarction (MI) (2.3% vs. 3.0%) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (1.3% vs. 1.4%) were similar in women and men, respectively, one-year mortality (6.5% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.02) and combined end point of death/MI/CABG (18.3% vs. 14.4%, p = 0.03) were higher in women than in men. After controlling for other factors, gender was not a significant predictor of death or death plus MI at one year. Despite a higher risk profile in women in the Dynamic registry in comparison with women in the 1985-1986 NHLBI PTCA registry, in-hospital death/MI/CABG was lower (6.0% vs. 11.6%, p < 0.001).Despite persistent high-risk characteristics in women, gender differences in outcomes in patients undergoing contemporary PCI have decreased, and outcomes in women have improved."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Genetic polymorphisms/mutations associated with venous thrombosis have largely been confined to the genes that encode for proteins in either the coagulant or the anticoagulant pathway. Although genetic alterations in the renin-angiotensin system have been reported to have a role in myocardial infarction and hypertension, there is recent evidence to suggest that there may also be an association with venous thrombosis. To extend our earlier observation of an association between the ACE DD genotype in African-American males and venous thrombosis, other genes in the renin-angiotensin pathway were investigated for possible disease association and were compared with African-Americans with myocardial infarction. African-American patients with a documented history of venous thrombosis or a history of myocardial infarction were eligible for participation as cases in the study. Control subjects were African-American outpatients attending a clinical laboratory for routine blood tests who had comparable age and gender distributions to the cases. Persons with a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or thrombosis were excluded. Genes that were analyzed for known polymorphisms included angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and the angiotensin II type I receptor. Our results showed that the ACE DD genotype was also associated with MI in African-American males but not in females. Racial/ethnic and sex differences were also found with respect to the genotype distribution of the ACE 4656(CT)(2/3) polymorphism. It was observed that the 2/2 genotype had a protective effective in males for myocardial infarction and venous thrombosis. The data also demonstrated that the allele frequencies of the A1166C variant of the angiotensin II type I receptor were different in African-Americans as compared to Caucasians."mycardial	Clinical	"Elevated heart rate (HR) has been found to be related to an increased death rate in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but sex differences and optimal timing for HR measurement have not been sufficiently investigated.To verify the predictive value of HR for one-year mortality in a cohort of subjects hospitalized for AMI, with men and women considered separately.HR was measured in 424 patients (303 men and 121 women) with constant sinus HR, on the first, third and seventh days after hospital admission for AMI. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained on the same days. All patients were followed up for one year.Among the men, the one-year mortality rate was 5% for the subjects with a seven-day HR of less than 80 beats/min, and the one-year mortality rate was 39% for patients with a seven- day HR of 80 beats/min or more (P<0.0001). Among the women, the differences in mortality related to HR were not significant. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, the relative risks of mortality in men who had an HR of 80 beats/min or more were 3.1 (CI=1.4 to 7.0, P=0.003) on the first day, 4.1 (CI=1.8 to 9.8, P=0.001) on the third day and 8.6 (CI=2.9 to 27.0, P<0.0001) on the seventh day. In the 203 men in whom echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction was measured, an interactive effect of high HR with depressed ejection fraction on mortality was found. Beta-blocking therapy influenced HR during AMI but did not influence the HR-mortality association.The results of the present prospective study show that HR measured during the first week after admission for AMI is an important predictor of mortality in men. The predictive power of HR increased from the first to the seventh day after AMI."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To characterise gender and age-related differences in presentation and outcome after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Data were derived retrospectively from the Singapore Myocardial Infarction Registry from 1988 through 1997. This database comprised all AMI cases for ages between 20 and 64 years (group A). For approximately three months a year, data were also collected for all AMI cases above the age of 64 years (group B). There were 13,048 and 4,425 cases in groups A and B respectively.In age - standardised AMI rates, males outnumbered females by a factor of 4.0 and 1.7 for groups A and B respectively.The median age of presentation was higher in females for both age groups being 58 years versus 54 years for group A and 75 years versus 72 years for group B. Younger females had worse survival at 28 days and were more likely to have prior ischaemic heart disease and require resuscitation. They were also more likely to have atypical symptoms. Previous myocardial infarction was not different between the sexes in both groups. Among the older age group, there was no gender difference in prior ischaemic heart disease, 28-day survival and requirement for resuscitation.Women who have AMI tend to be older than men. Gender differences are age-specific. Women who are 64 years and below have more atypical symptoms, prior ischaemic heart disease and worse prognosis than men after AMI. These differences are not seen in those over the age of 64."mycardial	Management	"Data are conflicting over whether women have higher mortality than men after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Younger but not older women hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction have higher in-hospital mortality rates than men. We hypothesized that younger women also have higher in-hospital mortality rates after CABG.We studied 51 187 patients (30% women) included in the National Cardiovascular Network database who received CABG at 23 clinical centers between October 1993 and December 1999. Compared with men, fewer women were white and more women had risk factors and comorbidities. These differences were more apparent in younger patients. In all age groups, however, women had higher left ventricular ejection fraction and fewer diseased vessels. Women had higher in-hospital mortality rates than men, but sex differences in mortality were more marked among younger patients. Women <50 years of age were 3 times more likely to die than men (3.4% versus 1.1%), and women 50 to 59 years of age were 2.4 times more likely to die than men (2.6% versus 1.1%). In the older age categories, the sex difference in in-hospital mortality was less marked (P<0.001 for the interaction between sex and age). Adjustment for preoperative risk factors only slightly decreased the strength of this interaction.Younger women undergoing CABG surgery are at a higher risk of in-hospital death than men, but this difference in risk decreases with advancing age. Additional investigation is needed to determine why in-hospital mortality is higher in women after CABG, with particular focus on younger women."mycardial	Management	"Previous reports have generally shown lower utilization of hospital resources and lower survival in women than men with acute myocardial infarction. However, to our knowledge, no reports have described the influence of payer status on the treatment and outcome of women and men with acute myocardial infarction.Baseline and clinical presenting characteristics, utilization of hospital resources, and subsequent clinical outcome were ascertained among 327 040 women and men enrolled in a national registry of myocardial infarction from June 1, 1994, to January 31, 1997. Separate Cox regression analyses were performed for Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations, and commercial payer groups to ascertain variables that were predictive of mortality in the study population.After adjustment for differences in age and other baseline and presenting characteristics, women were significantly more likely than men to die in the hospital (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.16), and this difference was greatest among women with health maintenance organization and commercial insurance (hazard ratios, 1.30 and 1.29, respectively), and least among women with Medicare (hazard ratio, 1.07). However, after adjustment for the additional effect on short-term survival of sex differences in the utilization of both pharmacologic treatments administered within the first 24 hours and invasive cardiac procedures, the mortality difference observed for women and men further diminished (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.10).In this large registry, we did not observe significant variations among payer classes in management and mortality among women and men after acute myocardial infarction."mycardial	Management	"There is conflicting information about gender differences in presentation, treatment, and outcome after acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the era of thrombolytic therapy and primary percutaneous coronary intervention. From June 1994 to January 1997, we enrolled 6,067 consecutive patients with STEMI admitted to 54 hospitals in southwest Germany in the Maximal Individual TheRapy of Acute myocardial infarction (MITRA), a community-based registry. Women were 9 years older than men, more often had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure, and had a history of previous myocardial infarction less often. Women had a longer prehospital delay (45 minutes), had anterior wall infarction more often (odds ratio [OR] 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08 to 1.36), and received reperfusion therapy less often (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94). The percentage of patients who were eligible for thrombolysis and received no reperfusion was higher in women (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.56 to 1.89). Women had recurrent angina (OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.71) and congestive heart failure (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.56) more often. There was a trend toward a higher hospital mortality in women (age-adjusted OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.35; multivariate OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.51), but there was no gender difference in long-term mortality after multivariate analysis (age-adjusted OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.15; multivariate OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.19). Thus, women with STEMI receive reperfusion therapy less often than men. They experience recurrent angina and congestive heart failure more often during their hospital stay. The age-adjusted long-term mortality is not different between men and women, but there is a trend for a higher short-term mortality in women."mycardial	Management	"To investigate sex differences in reaching diagnosis, medical management and case fatality (CF) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the population aged 35-64 years in northern Sweden.Within the framework of the World Health Organization Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases (MONICA) Project, definite AMI was monitored in people aged 35-64 years from 1989 through 1995 (target population 510 000 in 1991).In a population based coronary register, all coronary events were recorded in nine hospitals in 1989-95.The number of events included in the definite coronary myocardial infarction register was 2483 men and 669 women. On admission, a higher proportion of men with definite AMI had chest pain or ECG changes typical for AMI (P < 0.0001). Disagreement between clinical diagnosis and classification by MONICA criteria occurred more often in women (P=0.008). A significantly higher proportion of men was admitted in the coronary care unit and they were significantly more often treated with thrombolytics, nitroglycerine, beta-blockers, or antiplatelet agents. Women received significantly more diuretics, inotropics or calcium antagonists. Diabetes, conferring a worse prognosis, was more common in women (20 vs. 15%; P=0.003). Prehospital CF was significantly higher in men (24.1 vs. 18.3%; P=0.005), but in patients treated in hospital, the CF was significantly lower in men (12.7 vs. 21.2%; P < 0.001). Total CF was equal in men and women.Several factors contributing to the excess in-hospital CF in women were identified, including greater problems in diagnosis of AMI in women which may be one of the reasons for less intensive treatment in women. Differences in co-morbidity, most notably diabetes and medical treatment between men and women with acute AMI may also have played a part."mycardial	Outcomes	"The goal of our study was to examine how age and gender affect the use of coronary angiography and the intensity of cardiac follow-up care within the first year after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Another objective was to evaluate the association of age, gender and treatment intensity with five-year survival after AMI.Utilization rates of specialized cardiac services inversely correlate with age. Gender-specific practice patterns may also vary with age in a manner similar to known age-gender survival differences after AMI.Using linked population-based administrative data, we examined the association of age and gender with treatment intensity and long-term survival among 25,697 patients hospitalized with AMI in Ontario between April 1, 1992, and December 31, 1993. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust for socioeconomic status, illness severity, attending physician specialty and admitting hospital characteristics.After adjusting for baseline differences, the relative rates of angiography and follow-up specialist care for women relative to men, respectively, fell 17.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.6 to 21.3, p < 0.001) and 10.2% (95% CI, 7.1 to 13.2, p < 0.001) for every 10-year increase in age. Conversely, long-term AMI survival rates in women relative to men improved with increasing age, such that the relative survival in women rose 14.2% (95% CI, 10.1 to 17.5, p < 0.001) for every 10-year age increase.Gender differences in the intensity of invasive testing and follow-up care are strongly age-specific. While care becomes progressively less aggressive among older women relative to men, survival advantages track in the opposite direction, with older women clearly favored. These findings suggest that biology is likely to remain the main determinant of long-term survival after AMI for women."mycardial	Review	"Evidence has begun to accumulate that suggests there may be gender differences in the presenting symptoms of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Identification of gender differences has implications for both health care providers and the general public. Women should be instructed as to the symptoms expected with ACS on the basis of evidence obtained from studies that include both sexes. Twelve studies that identified symptoms of ACS for both women and men were identified through a review of the literature. In several of the studies, which included all types of ACS, women had significantly more back and jaw pain, nausea and/or vomiting, dyspnea, indigestion, and palpitations. In a number of the studies, which solely sampled patients with acute myocardial infarction, women demonstrated more back, jaw, and neck pain; nausea and/or vomiting; dyspnea; palpitations; indigestion; dizziness; fatigue; loss of appetite; and syncope. Men reported more chest pain and diaphoresis in the myocardial infarction sample. Results of these studies showed that women and men experienced the same symptoms with ACS. However, in some studies there were gender differences in the proportion of symptoms. Given the current state of the science, definitive conclusions regarding gender differences in the symptoms of ACS cannot be drawn. Further study is urgently needed to clarify and expand on these findings."mycardial	Management	"To examine sex differences in evaluation and outcome after stress testing for coronary artery disease (CAD) in a geographically defined cohort.Subjects were residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who underwent an initial stress test between January 1, 1987, and December 31, 1990. End points included referral for coronary angiography, death, and cardiac events, defined as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure.A total of 2276 men and 1270 women under went stress tests. Women were older and had more risk factors and comorbidities (P < .05). Among persons without documented CAD (86% of the cohort), the median probability of CAD was 11% (interquartile range, 5%-25%) for men and 8% (interquartile range, 2%-31%) for women (P < .001). Within 6 months after stress testing, 9% of men and 7% of women underwent coronary angiography. Among persons without documented CAD, there was no sex difference in referral for angiography when the stress test result was negative. When the test result was positive, men were more likely to be referred for angiography (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for male sex, 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-3.38; P = .008). After adjusting for the predicted probability of CAD, this association was no longer detected (adjusted OR for male sex, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.26-1.73; P = .41). Among persons with documented CAD, no sex difference was noted. After a mean +/- SD follow-up of 7.6 +/- 2.7 years and among persons without documented CAD, male sex was associated with a higher adjusted risk of death (relative risk for male sex, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05-1.86; P = .02) and cardiac events (relative risk for male sex, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.24-2.26; P < .001). Among persons with documented CAD, no sex difference in outcome was noted.These population-based data indicate that, when the diagnosis of CAD was not established, there was a greater use of angiography among men with positive stress test results, which could be attributed to the increased probability of CAD in men. In the absence of documented CAD, men fared worse than women, with an increase in the risk of death and cardiac events. Among persons with documented CAD, no sex difference in use of angiography and outcome was noted."mycardial	Management	"Several studies from the United States and from European countries have detected sex and age differences in clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of acute myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to determine how sex and age influence the management of and outcome for patients with acute myocardial infarction in Japan.A retrospective cohort study was performed by means of patient chart review at 4 teaching hospitals in Japan. There was a total of 482 patients (136 females [28%], 346 males [72%]) admitted consecutively with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction between July, 1995 and June, 1996.Female patients were older and had more comorbid diseases than male patients. Female patients also tended to have more cardiac complications during hospitalization and a greater 30-day mortality (10% vs 4%, P <.05). After adjustment for baseline characteristics and age/sex interaction, it was found that female patients were less likely to undergo thrombolytic therapy, cardiac catheterization, or revascularization, and they had a greater 30-day mortality. These sex differences in cardiac catheterization and revascularization were more pronounced for older patients. On the other hand, the sex differences in 30-day mortality were greater for younger patients.Our data suggest that cardiac catheterization, revascularization and 30-day mortality may have been related to patient sex and age, but further study is needed."mycardial	Outcomes	"This paper examines the types of nursing approaches associated with reductions in psychological distress in post-myocardial infarction patients (n=275 men; 156 women) who took part in a home-based psychosocial nursing Intervention program (Montreal Heart Attack Readjustment Trial). We found that three types of emotionally supportive approaches including reassurance/encouragement, listening and the provision of advice varied in their links to reduction in distress depending on patients' types of concerns. There were also gender differences in the way directive and collaborative intervention approaches were related to changes in distress."mycardial	Management	"A higher mortality risk for women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common finding in studies that compare the postinfarction outcome of women vs men. It is not clear, however, whether sex is an independent predictor of death among patients systematically treated with aggressive reperfusion and medical strategies.To assess the impact of patient's sex on outcome in a consecutive series of patients with AMI treated with a reperfusion strategy largely based on percutaneous coronary interventions.Inception cohort of 1937 patients (502 women and 1435 men) who were admitted with a diagnosis of AMI to a tertiary referral institution between January 1995 and December 2000.Mortality at 1 year after AMI.Compared with men, women were older (70 vs 61 years; P<.001) and had known diabetes or hypertension more often. Both men and women received essentially identical therapy with the majority of patients (86%) receiving reperfusion therapy via percutaneous coronary interventions. There were no significant differences in 1-year Kaplan-Meier death rates with 13.8% (68 cases) among women and 12.9% (184 cases) among men (unadjusted hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.39; P =.70). After age adjustment, women had a lower risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.87; P =.004).Despite their more advanced age and greater prevalence of diabetes or hypertension, women with AMI who were treated with a reperfusion strategy largely based on percutaneous coronary interventions show a similar outcome as men."mycardial	Management	"Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiac complications in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The clinical efficacy of these drugs in acute coronary syndromes, however, is still unclear. We did a meta-analysis of all large randomised trials designed to study the clinical efficacy and safety of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with acute coronary syndromes who were not routinely scheduled to undergo early coronary revascularisation.Inclusion criteria were: randomisation of patients with acute coronary syndromes but without persistent ST elevation; comparison of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor with placebo or control therapy; non-recommendation of early coronary revascularisation during study-drug infusion; and enrollment of at least 1000 patients. Data on individual patients were obtained from all participants in these trials.Six trials, enrolling 31402 patients, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 30 days after randomisation, 3530 (11.2%) patients died or developed a myocardial infarction. At 30 days, a 9% reduction in the odds of death or myocardial infarction was seen with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors compared with placebo or control (10.8% [1980/18297] vs 11.8% [1550/13105] events; odds ratio 0.91 [95% CI 0.84-0.98]; p=0.015). The relative treatment benefit was similar in subgroups of patients according to important clinical baseline characteristics; hence, the absolute treatment benefit was largest in high-risk patients. An unexpected and significant interaction was seen between sex and allocated treatment, with a treatment benefit in men (0.81 [0.75-0.89] but not in women (1.15 [1.01-1.30]). However, once patients were stratified according to troponin concentration, there was no evidence of a sex difference in treatment response, and a risk reduction was seen in men and women with raised troponin concentrations. Major bleeding complications were increased by glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (2.4% [445/18297] vs 1.4% [180/13105]; p<0.0001), but intracranial bleeding was not (16 [0.09%] vs 8 [0.06%]; p=0.40).Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors reduce the occurrence of death or myocardial infarction in patients with acute coronary syndromes not routinely scheduled for early revascularisation. The event reduction is greatest in patients at high risk of thrombotic complications. Treatment with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor might therefore be considered especially in such patients early after admission, and continued until a decision about early coronary revascularisation has been made."mycardial	Management	"This study was designed to determine the effect of gender on the prognostic value of exercise echocardiography.Limited information exists regarding gender differences in prognostic value of exercise echocardiography.We obtained follow-up (3.2 +/- 1.7 years) in 5,798 consecutive patients who underwent exercise echocardiography for evaluation of known or suspected coronary artery disease.There were 3,322 men (mean age 62 +/- 12 years) and 2,476 women (mean age 62 +/- 12 years) (p = 0.7). New or worsening wall motion abnormalities developed with exercise in 35% of men and 25% of women (p = 0.001). Cardiac events, including cardiac death (107 patients) and nonfatal myocardial infarction (148 patients), occurred in 5.3% of men and 3.1% of women (p = 0.001). Addition of the percentage of ischemic segments to the clinical and rest echocardiographic model provided incremental information in predicting cardiac events for both men (chi(2) = 137 to 143, p = 0.014) and women (chi(2) = 72 to 76, p = 0.046). By multivariate analysis, exercise electrocardiographic and exercise echocardiographic predictors of cardiac events in both men and women were workload and exercise wall motion score index. There was no significant interaction effect of rest echocardiography (p = 0.79), exercise electrocardiography (p = 0.38) or exercise echocardiography (p = 0.67) with gender.Although cardiac events occurred more frequently in men, the incremental value of exercise echocardiography was comparable in both genders. Of all exercise electrocardiographic and exercise echocardiographic variables, workload and exercise wall motion score index had the strongest association with outcome. The results of exercise echocardiography have comparable implications in both men and women."mycardial	Management	"Prior studies have reported race and sex differences in cardiac catheterization use after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). It is unclear whether race or sex differences in procedure refusal may contribute to this difference. We sought to determine whether cardiac catheterization refusal rates differ by patient race or sex.We evaluated medical records of 74,745 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for AMI between January 1994 and February 1996 to ascertain refusal of cardiac catheterization during hospitalization. Patient race and sex were evaluated for their association with cardiac catheterization refusal adjusting for patient, physician, and hospital characteristics.The cardiac catheterization refusal rate in the overall cohort was 2.92% (95% CI 2.80%-3.04%). Race and sex differences in cardiac catheterization were observed after multivariate adjustment, with white women (odds ratio [OR] 1.28), black men (OR 1.34), and black women (OR 1.37) more likely to refuse cardiac catheterization than white men (OR 1.00). Relative differences in refusal were associated with only modest absolute differences in risk-standardized rates of cardiac catheterization refusal; rates were lowest for white men (2.55%), and higher for white women (3.21%), black men (3.36%), and black women (3.38%, P <.001 for global comparison).Patient race and sex were associated with cardiac catheterization refusal among elderly patients hospitalized with AMI. However, absolute race and sex differences in rates of procedure refusal were small, suggesting that race and sex differences in cardiac catheterization refusal provide only a partial explanation of observed differences in cardiac procedure use."mycardial	Management	"To determine the effect of patient refusal on racial and sex differences in the use of coronary angiography and in outcomes among elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction.We included Medicare beneficiary patients admitted to hospitals performing coronary angiography from February 1994 through July 1995. In-hospital use and refusal of coronary angiography were determined, and adjusted for patient, hospital, and physician characteristics.Of 124,691 patients, 53,671 (43%) underwent angiography during hospitalization and 2881 (2.3%) refused. Patients refusing angiography were more likely to be female (odds ratio [OR] = 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23 to 1.53), black (OR = 1.26 vs. whites; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.56), and older (OR = 2.25 per 10-year increase; 95% CI: 2.05 to 2.43) than patients who underwent angiography. Angiography use was lower in blacks (OR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.83) than in whites, and lower in women (OR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.86) than in men. Increased refusal explained 6% (95% CI: -3% to 15%) of the difference in angiography use between whites and blacks, and 16% (95% CI: 10% to 22%) of the difference between men and women. After adjustment for patient characteristics, refusal of angiography was not associated with worse survival at 1 year (OR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.20).Among Medicare beneficiaries, elderly female and black patients are more likely to refuse angiography than are male and white patients. However, patient refusal is uncommon and accounts for only a small fraction of the racial and sex differences in use of angiography after myocardial infarction."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Associations between two alternative formulations of job stress derived from the effort-reward imbalance and the job strain model and first non-fatal acute myocardial infarction were studied. Whereas the job strain model concentrates on situational (extrinsic) characteristics the effort-reward imbalance model analyses distinct person (intrinsic) characteristics in addition to situational ones. In view of these conceptual differences the hypothesis was tested that combining information from the two models improves the risk estimation of acute myocardial infarction.951 male and female myocardial infarction cases and 1147 referents aged 45-64 years of The Stockholm Heart Epidemiology (SHEEP) case-control study underwent a clinical examination. Information on job stress and health adverse behaviours was derived from standardised questionnaires.Multivariate analysis showed moderately increased odds ratios for either model. Yet, with respect to the effort-reward imbalance model gender specific effects were found: in men the extrinsic component contributed to risk estimation, whereas this was the case with the intrinsic component in women. Controlling each job stress model for the other in order to test the independent effect of either approach did not show systematically increased odds ratios. An improved estimation of acute myocardial infarction risk resulted from combining information from the two models by defining groups characterised by simultaneous exposure to effort-reward imbalance and job strain (men: odds ratio 2.02 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.34 to 3.07); women odds ratio 2.19 (95% CI 1.11 to 4.28)).Findings show an improved risk estimation of acute myocardial infarction by combining information from the two job stress models under study. Moreover, gender specific effects of the two components of the effort-reward imbalance model were observed."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a complex disease caused by interaction of a number of genetic and environmental factors. This disease has reached epidemic proportions in South African Indian descendants. The aim of this study was to survey the prevalence of coronary heart disease risk factors in a sub-group of young Indian patients (< or = 45 years) who presented to the Coronary Care Unit at the R. K. Khan Hospital in Durban, a major referral centre for patients with acute MI in the province of Natal.A total of 245 patients < or = 45 years of age were recruited from patients consecutively admitted to the Coronary Care Unit at the R. K. Khan Hospital, Durban, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa between 1996 and 1999 with a diagnosis of acute MI. All patients were of Indian origin living in the Durban area in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. Demographic and risk factor data were obtained from all patients and included anthropometric measures, family history and the traditional cardiovascular risk factor assessment (smoking, lipids, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus). Clinical data included in-hospital presentation, management and complications and angiographic classification of coronary atherosclerosis. The most prevalent risk factors were previous: smoking (74%), and hypertriglyceridaemia (54%). Only 14% of the population presenting with an acute MI were women. Smoking was more common among men (81%) than in women (35%). Abnormal high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were detected in 38% of the patients with a dear gender difference: 43% and 9%, in men and women, respectively. In contrast hypertension was more prevalent in young women with MI than in men: 38% and 19%, respectively. Coronary angiography was performed in 79 patients on admission; a single vessel stenosis was found in 28%, two vessel disease in 20% and triple vessel disease in 52%, respectively. On admission, 92% of patients were in Killip class I. Overt heart failure and cardiogenic shock were uncommon and were seen in 3.3% and 0.8%, respectively. Patients who received thrombolytic therapy had fewer complications (8%) compared to those who did not (11%). However, the difference towards a benefit of thrombolysis did not reach significance. Recurrent angina (6%) was the commonest complication, while ventricular arrhythmias were observed in 2% of patients. There was a strong familial link: 54% of the patients had a family background of coronary heart disease (CHD) while 42% and 41% had family members who suffered from diabetes mellitus and hypertension, respectively.Smoking and dyslipidaemia (predominantly hypertriglyceridaemia, and low HDL-cholesterol) were the most common cardiovascular risk factors of MI in young South African Indians. A strong familial link was observed not only for a history of CHD/MI, but also for hypertension and diabetes mellitus, supporting a genetic basis for the development of premature CHD. Therefore, further analysis of potential genetic factors such as variance of genes involved in vascular homeostasis, haemostatic factors, lipid metabolism and other metabolic factors seems warranted."mycardial	Review	"Coronary heart disease (CHD) and specifically acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are the most common causes of death among both men and women throughout the world. Although CHD mortality rates have been halved in many developed countries in recent decades, some studies have pointed out significant differences regarding time-related tendencies of mortality between the sexes. This paper briefly reviews factors related to post-AMI survival and possible reasons for inequalities in survival benefit between men and women after AMI. Presentation of AMI also exhibits differences with regard to sex, and this has some effect on patient care and on mortality from the disease. CHD morbidity and mortality rates vary with socioeconomic deprivation and social patterning in most industrialized countries. Several studies have indicated that women sustaining AMI have a higher mortality than men. Although AMI affects men in greater numbers, the short-term outcomes for women are worse. Studies suggest that, over the longer term, the mortality risk for women is lower than, or similar to, that for men. It is still a major problem that in-hospital case fatality and morbidity rates in the post-infarction period are higher for women, despite lower rates of administration of thrombolytics and catheterization. Patients admitted to the hospital with an AMI should be offered optimal treatment, irrespective of age or sex."mycardial	Management	"Although there are an increasing number and variety of medications available for the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), few data are available describing recent, and changes over time in, use of different cardiac medications in patients with AMI from a more generalizable, community-wide perspective. Moreover, it is unclear whether the demographic and clinical profile of patients receiving these agents is similar or varies according to the type of agent prescribed.The purpose of this study was to examine recent patterns and changes over a decade-long period (1986 to 1997) in the use of cardiac medications during the acute hospitalization and at the time of hospital discharge in metropolitan Worcester, Mass, residents (1990 census estimate, 437,000) hospitalized with confirmed AMI. There was a marked increase in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering agents, and thrombolytic therapy between 1986 and 1997. The use of calcium antagonists, lidocaine, and other antiarrhythmic agents declined over this period. Similar trends were observed in the use of these agents in hospital survivors at the time of hospital discharge. Patient age, presence of comorbidities, and AMI-associated characteristics influenced the use of these therapies; sex differences in the use of several of these medications were also noted.The results of this population-based observational study provide insights into changing prescribing patterns in the hospital treatment of patients with AMI. Despite encouraging increases in the use of several of these agents, considerable opportunities for increased utilization remain."mycardial	Outcomes	"Psychosocial factors, such as emotional distress and social isolation, have been increasingly recognized as important risk factors for patients' recovery from acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study examined age, gender, and ethnic differences in depression and general distress, social support, and health-related quality of life after AMI.Data came from a series of 88 patients aged 62.1 +/- 14.2 years (46% female) who were hospitalized for AMI at eight different US clinical centers participating in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) Pilot Study. Standardized psychometric measures were administered to assess three psychosocial domains: (1) depression and general distress (mental health functioning), (2) social support, and (3) health-related quality of life. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to examine the effects of age, gender, and ethnic differences in each of the three psychosocial domains.Female patients reported higher levels of depression and distress compared with male patients (P = .040). Gender differences in mental health functioning differed by age (P = .046), with the greatest differences observed among younger female patients. Older patients (P = .014) and female patients (P = .025) reported lower levels of social support compared with younger and male patients, respectively. Minority patients did not differ from nonminority patients in mental health functioning or social support, and there were no significant differences in post-AMI quality of life on the basis of age, gender, or ethnicity.The psychosocial risk profile after AMI may be different for male and female patients, and interventions may need to take account of each gender's specific needs."mycardial	Outcomes	"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of gender on clinical course and in-hospital mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Previous studies have demonstrated higher mortality for women compared with men with ST elevation myocardial infarctions and higher rates of CS after AMI. The influence of gender and its interaction with various treatment strategies on clinical outcomes once CS develops is unclear.Using the SHould we emergently revascularize Occluded Coronaries for cardiogenic shocK? (SHOCK) Registry database of 1,190 patients with suspected CS in the setting of AMI, we examined shock etiologies by gender. Among the 884 patients with predominant left ventricular (LV) failure, we compared the patient demographics, angiographic and hemodynamic findings, treatment approaches as well as the clinical outcomes of women versus men. This study had a 97% power to detect a 10% absolute difference in mortality by gender.Left ventricular failure was the most frequent cause of CS for both gender groups. Women in the SHOCK Registry had a significantly higher incidence of mechanical complications including ventricular septal rupture and acute severe mitral regurgitation. Among patients with predominant LV failure, women were, on average, 4.6 years older, had a higher incidence of hypertension, diabetes and a lower cardiac index. The overall mortality rate for the entire cohort was high (61%). After adjustment for differences in patient demographics and treatment approaches, there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the two gender groups (odds ratio = 1.03, 95% confidence interval of 0.73 to 1.43, p = 0.88). Mortality was also similar for women and men who were selected for revascularization (44% vs. 38%, p = 0.244).Women with CS complicating AMI had more frequent adverse clinical characteristics and mechanical complications. Women derived the same benefit as men from revascularization, and gender was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality in the SHOCK Registry."mycardial	Outcomes	"There is evidence for gender differences in the treatment and outcome of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, little data exist about these differences in patients from the Arab Middle East. Therefore, we studied the influence of patient gender on the presentation, the use of thrombolytic therapy, and in-hospital mortality after AMI in Kuwaiti nationals. This is a retrospective study of all consecutive Kuwaiti patients admitted to the coronary care unit of a university hospital with the diagnosis of AMI between June 1994 and May 1997. A total of 89 women and 267 men were included. Women were older than men and had significantly higher rates of diabetes (72% vs 46%), hypertension (58% vs 33%) and hypercholesterolemia (80% vs 53%). Women were less likely to receive thrombolytic therapy (40% vs 62%, p=0.001). Fewer women were eligible for thrombolytic therapy (50% vs 66%, p<0.05). Of those who were eligible for thrombolysis there was no sex difference in receiving such treatment. The in-hospital mortality among women younger than 70 years was 2.5 times higher than among men in the same age group, while there was no difference in mortality between women and men aged 70 years and older. We conclude that women and men with AMI have different clinical characteristics and outcomes following AMI. There was no gender bias for the use of thrombolytic therapy. The higher in-hospital mortality in younger women, i.e. less than 70 years, compared to younger men, indicates that younger women with AMI should be considered as a high-risk group."mycardial	2001 May	"Male gender is an established risk factor for first myocardial infarction, but some studies have suggested that among myocardial infarction survivors, women fare worse than men. Therefore, we examined the long-term prognosis of incident myocardial infarction survivors in a large, population-based MI register, addressing gender differences in mortality as well as the number of events and time intervals between recurrent events.Study subjects included 4900 men and women, aged 25-64 years, with definite or probable first myocardial infarctions who were alive 28 days after the onset of symptoms. At first myocardial infarction, women were older and more likely to be hypertensive or diabetic than men, and had a greater proportion of probable vs definite events. After adjustment for age and geographic region, men had 1.74 times the risk of fatal coronary heart disease relative to women (hazard ratio=1.63 and 1.55 for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, respectively) over an average of 5.9 years of follow-up. Number and time intervals between any recurrent event--fatal and non-fatal--did not differ by gender.These data suggest that men are far more likely to have a fatal recurrent event than women despite comparable numbers of events."mycardial	Outcomes	"The objective of this secondary analysis was to examine the relationships between a reduction in psychological distress and long-term cardiac and psychological outcomes in post-myocardial infarction patients who participated in a randomized trial of home-based psychosocial nursing interventions (the Montreal Heart Attack Readjustment Trial [M-HART]). Gender differences were considered.We studied 433 patients (36.0% women) from the M-HART treatment group who received two home visits after achieving a high psychological distress score (ie, > or =5) on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Short-term GHQ success was determined by a return to a normal GHQ score (<5) or a reduction of > or =50% after the two visits. Patients with short-term successful and unsuccessful GHQ outcomes were compared for mid-term maintenance of success, 1-year death and readmission rates, and 1-year depression and anxiety symptoms.Patients with short-term GHQ success were more likely to show mid-term GHQ success (p < .001), marginally less likely to die of any causes (p = .087), less likely to die of cardiac causes (p = .043), less likely to be readmitted for any reason (p < .001) and for cardiac reasons (p < .001), and less likely to have high depression (p < .001) and anxiety (p < .001) at 1-year than patients with short-term unsuccessful GHQ outcomes. Results held for men and women and were not altered by controlling for potential confounders. However, the number of deaths prevented analysis with statistical controls.Post-myocardial infarction interventions that reduce psychological distress have the potential to improve long-term prognosis and psychological status for both men and women."mycardial	Epidemiology	"We examined short and long term outcomes of MI in a consecutive series of 169 men and 50 women who were followed for an average of 3.5 years. Similar percentages of men and women were admitted to medical intensive care, received in-patient cardiac rehabilitation, quit smoking at one year, were still smoking, were taking a lipid lowering drug or had returned to work at one year, underwent coronary angiography at 3.5 years or had died by 3.5 years. The lack of gender difference in outcome may reflect an absence of gender bias in the management of men and women with MI in southwest Scotland."mycardial	Management	"Recovery following successful coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been dramatically improved with the use of fast-track methods. Although data exist that demonstrate a significant gender difference in survival following CABG, little is known about factors influencing gender-specific recovery. This report describes a series of consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG to determine gender-associated factors that may impact outcomes and recovery.Five hundred and seventeen consecutive patients underwent isolated CABG utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass and were retrospectively reviewed. The outcomes of 351 men in the study were compared to the group of 160 women. A rapid recovery protocol focused on reduced cardiopulmonary bypass time, aggressive preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump use, early extubation, perioperative administration of corticosteroids and thyroid hormone, aggressive diuresis and atrial fibrillation prevention was applied to all patients.The 30-day mortality rate for the women was 4.2% (Parsonnet risk 16.3+/-9.0) compared with 3.4% (Parsonnet risk 9.9+/-7.5) for the men. There were no statistically significant differences in the 30-day mortality rates or postoperative complication rates between the women and men. The women, however, were found to be older (71+/- years versus 65+/- years, p<0.001), and to have a higher incidence of acute myocardial infarction (31% versus 20%, p<0.05), obesity (23% versus 10%, p <0.05), diabetes (31% versus 22%, p<0.05), hypertension (65% versus 48%, p<0.001), and symptomatic vascular disease (20% versus 12%, p<0.05). The women required fewer bypass grafts (2.9 versus 3.5 grafts, p<0.001), and consequently, had shorter cross and cardiopulmonary bypass times. Rapid recovery with discharge before the fifth postoperative day was achieved in 30% of the women, in comparison to 44% of the men (p<0.01). The postoperative hospital length of stay was longer for the women in comparison to the men (7.2+/-7.1 versus 5.8+/-5.2 days, p<0.05).Women had similar operative mortality and postoperative complication rates to men under a rapid recovery protocol. However, women have a longer recovery interval compared to men, which may be a reflection of their higher preoperative risk profile."mycardial	Outcomes	"An interaction between sex and age is thought to affect hospital mortality after myocardial infarction; younger, but not older, women have been shown to have higher mortality rates than men. It is currently unknown whether findings are similar after hospital discharge.To determine whether an interaction between sex and age affects 2-year mortality after myocardial infarction.Community-based prospective cohort study.16 community hospitals serving the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area.6826 patients who survived hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction during ten 1-year periods between 1975 and 1995.Mortality 2 years after hospital discharge.The overall 2-year mortality rate was higher in women (28.9%) than in men (19.6%). When patients were examined by age group, however, only women younger than 60 years of age had a higher mortality rate than men of similar age. The sex difference decreased with increasing age; among the oldest patients, women had a lower mortality rate than men (P = 0.009 for the interaction between sex and age). This relationship was not affected by adjustment for demographic characteristics and medical history, clinical characteristics, and hospital and discharge treatments; the hazard of 2-year death for women compared with men increased 15.4% (95% CI, 4.3% to 27.6%) for every 10-year decrease in age. In absolute terms, after adjustment for demographic characteristics and medical history, among patients younger than 60 years of age women were at greater risk than men (risk difference, 1.8 percentage points). At older ages, however, women were at lower risk than men.Younger, but not older, women who survive hospitalization for myocardial infarction have a higher long-term mortality rate than men. This provides additional evidence that younger women with myocardial infarction are at greater risk for death than men."mycardial	Management	"A paucity of data exists on the importance of gender in contributing to the mortality rate after primary angioplasty, although it is has been shown that women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are less likely than men to undergo reperfusion treatments. This study analyzes gender-related differences in 6-month clinical and angiographic outcomes in nonselected patients with AMI who underwent primary angioplasty or stenting. We compared clinical and angiographic outcomes of 230 women and 789 men who underwent primary angioplasty or stenting from January 1995 to August 1999. The women were older than the men, and had a greater incidence of diabetes and cardiogenic shock. The 6-month mortality rate was 12% in women and 7% in men (p = 0.028). Nonfatal reinfarction occurred in 3% of the women and in 1% of the men (p = 0.010). There were no differences in repeat target vessel revascularization rates. After multivariate analysis, gender did not emerge as a significant variable in relation to 6-month mortality or to the combined end point of death, reinfarction, and repeat target vessel revascularization. Both women and men with stented infarct arteries had lower restenosis rates (29% and 26%, respectively) than patients without stents (52% and 39%, repectively). The results of outcome analysis in nonselected patients suggest that sex is not an independent predictor of mortality after primary angioplasty for AMI, and that the benefit of primary stenting is similar in men and women."mycardial	2001 Feb	"Women, particularly younger women, hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction have been found to have poorer prognosis than men. A large proportion of deaths due to myocardial infarction, however, occur in the pre-hospital phase. We set out to analyse age-specific sex differences in survival after myocardial infarction at different time intervals from the onset of acute myocardial infarction, including pre-hospital deaths and 1-year overall survival.The National Acute Myocardial Infarction Register in Sweden was used to analyse age-specific sex differences in mortality outside hospital, 28-day mortality and 1-year mortality in 353 905 cases occurring between 1987 and 1995 in Swedish men and women aged 30 to 89 years. Overall, one in four of all myocardial infarction victims died outside hospital. At all ages, except in individuals younger than 50 years, men had higher pre-hospital mortality. The odds of dying within 28 days for women below 50 years of age, compared to men, was 1.84 (1.56--2.18) in hospitalized patients and 1.31 (1.18--1.46) in all infarction patients. Above the age of 65, in the total population with myocardial infarction, women had a better prognosis, with odds ratios ranging from 0.83 to 0.89. In patients surviving the first 28 days, 4.0% of the women and 2.9% of the men below the age of 50 were dead within a year after the infarction, odds ratio 1.37 (1.06--1.76). This excess mortality was mainly due to diabetes and non-cardiac causes. Only women younger than 50 years had a significantly poorer overall 1-year survival than men of the same age. At the age of 70 or more, women had a small survival advantage.In the total acute myocardial infarction population, only women under 50 years of age have a consistently worse prognosis than men. Much of the excess mortality in young women seems to be associated with diabetes."mycardial	Outcomes	"Morbidity and mortality after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been reported to be higher in women than men. However, in some prior reports, women were not treated as aggressively as men, suggesting a treatment bias. We sought to determine whether sex influenced short-term outcomes in a cohort of AMI patients, all of whom underwent primary angioplasty.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing primary angioplasty for a first AMI in New York State in 1995. A total of 1044 patients, 317 women and 727 men, were identified. Mean age was 59+/-12 years in men and 65+/-12 years in women (P<0.05). Women had a higher prevalence of hypertension (59% versus 44%, P<0.05), diabetes (19% versus 14%, P<0.05), and peripheral vascular or carotid disease (9.5% versus 5.5%, P<0.05) than men. Men were more likely to be treated earlier (within 6 hours) from the time of symptom onset than women (74% versus 63%, P<0.05). Women had a higher incidence of shock or hemodynamic instability than men (25% versus 17%, P<0.05). The unadjusted in-hospital mortality rate was 7.9% in women and 2.3% in men (P<0.05). After multivariate logistic regression analysis, women maintained a 2.3-fold higher risk of in-hospital death compared with their male counterparts (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 4.6, P=0.016).After correcting for age and baseline risk differences, women undergoing primary angioplasty for AMI have a significantly higher in-hospital mortality rate than men."mycardial	Management	"Many studies indicate that women are less likely than men to undergo cardiac procedures after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), raising concerns of sexual bias in clinical care. However, no data exist regarding the relationship between patient sex, physician sex, and use of cardiac procedures.To determine whether sex differences in cardiac catheterization after AMI were greater when patients were treated by male attending physicians compared with female attending physicians.Analysis of data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a retrospective medical record review. A total of 104 >231 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who were hospitalized in US acute care hospitals for an AMI between January 1994 and February 1995.Use of cardiac catheterization within 60 days of admission, compared between the 4 groups of patient sex-physician sex combinations.Women underwent fewer cardiac catheterizations than men when treated by either male physicians (38.6% vs 50.8%; P =.001) or female physicians (34.8% vs 45.8%; P =.001). Sex differences in procedure use were not greater when a patient and physician were of different sexes (P for interaction =.85). After potential confounders in multivariable analysis were accounted for, women were less likely to undergo cardiac catheterization (risk ratio, 0.90 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88-0.92]), regardless of the treating physician's sex. Patients treated by male physicians were more likely to undergo cardiac catheterization (risk ratio, 1.06 [95%CI, 1.02-1.10]) than those treated by female physicians, regardless of patient sex.Women who have had an AMI undergo a cardiac catheterization less often than men, whether treated by a male or female physician. These results suggest that factors other than sexual bias by male physicians toward women account for sex differences in cardiac procedure use."mycardial	Outcomes	"To assess the clinical characteristics, management and outcome of women compared to men with acute myocardial infarction or ischaemia.A prospective clinical survey was made in a random sample of 94 District General Hospitals in the U.K. 1064 patients, <70 years of age, comprising six consecutive females and six consecutive males from each hospital, diagnosed on admission as acute coronary syndromes (myocardial infarction or myocardial ischaemia) were studied. Outcome measures included: admission and final diagnosis, time to delivery of care, inpatient management, complications and clinical outcome.Five hundred and three women and 561 men were admitted with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or myocardial ischaemia. Women were older, waited longer between seeking and receiving advice, and much less likely to have infarction than men. After adjustment for age, diagnosis and past medical history there were no gender differences in initial and subsequent hospital management, in complications (recurrent ischaemia, arrhythmias, temporary pacing, heart failure), any routine procedure or outcome. Of all patients, 3.4% died in a District General Hospital, 12.2% were transferred to Specialist Cardiac Centres and 84.4% discharged home. Prophylactic medication on discharge was similar for men and women.After adjustment for age, diagnosis and past medical history, although women waited longer between seeking and receiving medical advice, in hospital their assessment, management, complications, outcome and follow-up arrangements were the same as for men. In hospital, management and outcomes were mainly influenced by age, diagnosis (infarction or ischaemia), a past history of coronary disease, but not by gender. This large, nationally representative, survey has found no evidence of important gender difference in the hospital management of acute ischaemic syndromes."mycardial	Review	"In every year since 1984, cardiovascular disease has claimed the lives of more women than men. Data from randomized trials indicate that gender contributes to increased mortality after myocardial infarction independent of other risk factors, but additional confounding variables cannot be discounted. Data from registry databases indicate that women are less likely to receive medically proven therapies for myocardial infarction. Women experience more vague symptoms, which may account for underuse of effective therapies. In addition, they may benefit less from thrombolytic therapy than men. Increased use of thrombolytic therapy has resulted in a continued decrease in cardiovascular deaths for men, but not for women. It is unclear if this disparity is a result of inequitable access to therapy or decreased efficacy of these agents in women."mycardial	Outcomes	"Women with coronary artery disease (CAD) are believed to have a higher risk for adverse outcomes than men after conventional coronary interventions. The increasing use of coronary stenting has improved the outcome of patients undergoing coronary interventions, but little is known about the nature of outcomes in men vs women after this procedure.To examine whether there are sex-based differences in prognostic factors and in early and late outcomes among CAD patients undergoing coronary stent placement.Inception cohort study, at 2 tertiary referral institutions in Germany. Consecutive series of 1001 women and 3263 men with symptomatic CAD who were treated with stenting between May 1992 and December 1998. Patients who underwent stenting in the setting of acute myocardial infarction were excluded.The combined event rates of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction, assessed at 30 days and 1 year after stenting and compared by sex.Compared with men, women undergoing coronary stenting were significantly older (mean age, 69 vs 63 years) and more likely to present with diabetes, arterial hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia. Women had less extensive CAD, a less frequent history of myocardial infarction and better preserved left ventricular function than men. Women presented an excess risk of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction only during the early period after stenting: the 30-day combined event rate of death or myocardial infarction was 3.1% in women and 1.8% in men (P =.02) and the multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for women was 2.02 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-3.19). At 1 year, the outcome was similar for both women and men (combined event rate for women, 6.0%, and for men, 5.8% (P =.77); multivariate-adjusted HR for women, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.75-1.48]). There was a sex difference in the prognostic value of baseline characteristics: the strongest prognostic factors were diabetes in women and age in men.The results of this study indicate that 1-year outcomes of women with CAD undergoing coronary artery stenting are similar to those of men. Despite the similarity in outcomes, there are several sex-specific differences in baseline characteristics, clinical course after the intervention, and relative weight of prognostic factors. JAMA. 2000;284:1799-1805."mycardial	Review	"In every year since 1984, cardiovascular disease has claimed the lives of more females than males. More than 450,000 women succumb to heart disease annually, and 250,000 die of coronary artery disease. Despite the proportions, most women believe they will die of breast cancer. The perception that heart disease is a man's disease and that women are more likely to die of breast cancer is alarming. Although women develop heart disease about 10 years later than men, they are likely to fare worse after a heart attack. The poorer outcomes are due, in part, to the failure to identify heart attack symptoms. Approximately 35% of heart attacks in women are believed to go unnoticed or unreported. However, because of increased age, women are more likely to have co-morbid diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. In women, not only is ""tightness"" or discomfort in the chest a warning sign, but in addition, nausea and dizziness are common indicators of myocardial ischemia. Other symptoms include breathlessness, perspiration, a sensation of fluttering in the heart, and fullness in the chest. In comparison to men, women are less likely to undergo tertiary care interventions such as cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, thrombolytic therapy, and bypass surgery; to participate in cardiac rehabilitation; and to return to work full-time after myocardial infarction. In the past, most research about treatments for heart disease focused on men, and gender differences have been ignored. Recent studies are enrolling enough women to test if there are differences between men and women in outcomes. One of the major areas of research relates to estrogen and hormonal replacement therapy to reduce the relative risk of heart attack and stroke. The Women's Health Initiative is a major NIH-sponsored trial that addresses the issue of primary prevention of cardiac disease by hormonal replacement therapy. The results will be available in 2004. The Heart Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS), disappointingly, did not show a significant reduction of coronary events in women taking hormonal replacement therapy, nor did the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis (ERA) trial of 309 postmenopausal women who underwent coronary angiography. New insight into the role of vitamins, phytoestrogens and other natural sources, and selective estrogen receptor modulators may provide other options for management. Until then, modification of risk factors and healthy life style choices are recommended for reducing the risk of cardiac disease. In fact, the key to a healthy heart in the year 2000 appears closely tied to life style choices. Prevention of disease is the key, and current recommendations are simply to stop smoking, or do not start; treat and control blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg; manage elevated lipids by diet, exercise, and cholesterol-lowering medications (if necessary); treat diabetes; lose weight so that BMI is <25; walk for 20-30 minutes at least three times a week; and take an aspirin tablet daily."mycardial	Outcomes	"Previous studies have suggested that women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are less aggressively managed than are men. The aim of this study was to assess sex differences in medical and invasive coronary procedures (angiography, PTCA, and CABG) in AMI patients admitted to cardiac care units (CCUs) in Israel in the mid 1990s and their association with early and 1-year prognosis.We studied 2867 consecutive AMI patients (2125 men, 74%) hospitalized in all 25 CCUs in Israel from 3 prospective nationwide surveys conducted in 1992, 1994, and 1996. Women were, on average, older than men (69 versus 61 years, P:<0.0001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, Killip class >/=II on admission, and in-hospital complications. Women received aspirin and beta-blockers less often than did men, but these differences were not significant after age adjustment. The unadjusted rates of thrombolysis, angiography, and PTCA/CABG use were lower in women than in men but not after covariate adjustment: 42% versus 48% (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11), 23% versus 31% (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.09), and 15% versus 19% (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.19), respectively. The 30-day mortality was higher in women than in men (17.6% versus 9.6%, respectively; OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.82), but the 30-day to 1-year mortality rate was not (9.1% versus 5.6%, respectively; hazard ratio 1.18, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.66).This prospective nationwide observational community-based study of consecutive AMI patients hospitalized in the CCUs in the mid 1990s indicates that women fare significantly worse than do men at 30 days but not thereafter at 1-year. The difference in 30-day outcome was not influenced by the use of different therapeutic modalities, including thrombolysis and invasive coronary procedures, but was rather due to the older age and greater comorbidity of women; these findings seem also to explain the less frequent use of invasive procedures in women."mycardial	Epidemiology	"According to recent data, women have a greater risk of dying from an acute coronary event. The determinants of this ominous prognosis are not completely understood. Preliminary analysis of our data suggested that this poorer prognosis is also observed in the subgroup of patients with acute myocardial infarction submitted to direct coronary angioplasty (PTCA). This finding prompted us to investigate gender differences and their determinants in this particular context.To identify risk factors associated with the greater in-hospital mortality of women with acute infarction who underwent PTCA.One hundred and forty-five consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent direct PTCA in the same hospital were studied retrospectively. Data were collected from the database of the catheterisation laboratory and from clinical files. The following parameters were analysed: in-hospital mortality, age, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, history of coronary heart disease, time elapsed from beginning of symptoms to coronary intervention, peak values of CK and MB-CK, number of coronary arteries with significant disease at angiography, culprit lesion localisation, and prevalence of shock on admission. For statistical analysis, cross-tabulation (Pearson x2) and comparison of means (Student's t test) were employed when appropriate; an error of 5% was admitted for the rejection of the null hypothesis.Women (n = 39) represented 26.9% of sample. In hospital mortality was 28.2% (n = 11) for women and 11.3% (n = 12) for men (p = 0.014). The prevalence of coronary heart disease before the current acute event, the time elapsed from beginning of symptoms to coronary intervention, and maximum values of CK and MB-CK were similar in both genders. Differences between women and men were found as regards the following variables (women vs men): age (61.7 +/- 10 vs 56.1 +/- 12.6 years), prevalence of left main disease (15.3 vs 1.9%) and prevalence of shock (41 vs 17%) and diabetes (38.7 vs 13.6%). Considering women and men who died, only disease severity as evaluated by the number of vessels involved distinguished both genders (p = 0.05).In our experience, women admitted with acute myocardial infarction and treated by direct PTCA are, on average, older than men and have a greater prevalence of shock at admission, of left main disease and of diabetes, and more severe coronary artery disease. In the present series and as regard in-hospital mortality, disease severity as evaluated by the number of vessels involved is the only variable that discriminates women from men."mycardial	Outcomes	"The aim of this study was to analyse time trends in survival after acute myocardial infarction with special emphasis on sex differences.Within the framework of the population-based WHO MONICA Project, all acute myocardial infarction events were recorded in the age group 25-64 years in northern Sweden during the period 1985-94. All first-ever myocardial infarction patients were followed for information on vital status.A total of 3397 men and 860 women with acute myocardial infarction, during the period between 1985 and 1994.Case fatality rates after first-ever acute myocardial infarction.When compared with the 1985-86 cohort, the age-adjusted odds ratio for death within 1 year after acute myocardial infarction was 0.59 (95% CI 0.46-0.76) in the 1993-94 male cohort but 0.99 (95% CI 0.61-1.60) in the female 1993-94 cohort. Corresponding age-adjusted proportions of death within 1 year were 33.3% and 22.9% in men and 27.5% and 27.3% in women in 1985-86 and 1993-94, respectively. The odds ratio for 3-year case fatality amongst those who survived the first 28 days was 0.34 (95% CI 0.21-0.55) in 1991-92 compared with 1985-86 in men and 0.91 (0.43-1.94) in women.Both short- and long-term survival after AMI have improved markedly in men over the last decade. There is a disturbing sex difference in that, during the same period, survival in women with AMI has not improved at all. This sex difference was not explained by differences in conventional prognostic factors."mycardial	Review	"To determine whether women with anamnestic suspicion of angina pectoris more often than men with suspicion of angina pectoris have normal coronary arteries on coronary arteriograms.

Data on the prognosis of the general population were obtained from a WHO project.Three articles were selected about sex differences in the presence of angiographically normal coronary arteries in patients with suspected angina pectoris. In 2 articles normal coronary arteries were found more often in women (40-41%) than in men (8-12%). In 1 article women were found to have less severe and extensive coronary artery disease then men. Eight articles were selected about the prognosis of patients with suspected angina pectoris and angiographically normal coronary arteries. Per 1000 patient years the total number of deaths ranged from 0 to 6.59 (weighted mean: 4.05), the number of deaths due to coronary disease from 0 to 0.92 (0.47) and the number of patients with non fatal myocardial infarctions from 0 to 1.83 (0.94). These figures were similar to those in an average population.Women with anamnestic suspicion of angina pectoris have normal coronary angiograms more often than mean with anamnestic suspicion of angina pectoris. The prognosis of patients with suspected angina pectoris and normal coronary arteries in terms of mortality and number of non fatal myocardial infarctions is the same as in the general population."mycardial	Management	"To determine and compare the baseline characteristics and outcomes between men and women in a Canadian cardiac rehabilitation program.Nonrandomized, retrospective, observational study with a before and after research design.The Prevention and Rehabilitation Centre at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, a tertiary cardiac care centre.Three hundred and eighty-seven patients, 82% male aged 59+/-10 years and 18% female aged 61+/-4 years, who were enrolled in the on-site cardiac rehabilitation program between November 1, 1995 and April 1, 1997.A three-month, multifactorial cardiac rehabilitation program that incorporates exercise training, risk factor modification, education and psychosocial support.Fewer than 20% of all rehabilitation participants (n=70; 18%) were women; most participants were under 65 years of age. More women than men had a primary diagnosis of myocardial infarction (42% versus 28%, respectively), whereas men were more likely than women to have had coronary artery bypass grafting (45% versus 23%, respectively). Men and women had similar mean baseline measures of body mass index, blood pressure and glucose levels, whereas women had significantly higher mean baseline measures of total cholesterol (5.6 mmol/L versus 5.0 mmol/L for men, P 0.001), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (3.4 mmol/L versus 3.1 mmol/L, P=0. 012) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (1.2 mmol/L versus 1.0 mmol/L, P 0.001). Baseline LDL to HDL ratios were 3.3 for men and 3.0 for women (not significant), and total cholesterol to HDL ratios were 5.4 and 4.9 for men and women, respectively. Men had a higher exercise capacity than women coming into the program (metabolic equivalent [METs] 6.6 versus 4.9, respectively, P 0.001), had a higher baseline activity level (1114 kcal/week versus 617 kcal/week, P=0.001) and scored higher than women in all health-related quality of life scores. After the program, there were no significant sex differences in improvement in MET level, physical activity or risk factor profile. Although men exercised more than women (increase of 557 kcal/week versus 343 kcal/week, respectively), this was not statistically significant. In health-related quality of life scores, both men and women improved in all scores, although women reported less increase than men in their level of overall vitality (P=0.016).Women are the minority of cardiac rehabilitation patients, although they appear to benefit equally well from the program."mycardial	Outcomes	"Studies of gender differences in the sexual activity of men and women after a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have produced conflicting results. The present study was performed to determine whether there are gender differences (1) in the quantity and quality of sexual activity after a first AMI, and (2) in the relations between selected demographic and medical variables and sexual activity after AMI. Four hundred sixty-two men and 51 women with a first AMI were interviewed once before discharge and again 3 to 6 months after AMI. Patients' demographic and medical background and their frequency of and satisfaction with sexual behavior were obtained from the interviews and from medical charts. Analyses of variance showed that women reported significantly less frequency of and satisfaction with sexual activity than men before and after AMI. Both women and men reported significantly less sexual activity and less satisfaction with sexual activity after AMI than before AMI. The decrease in frequency of and satisfaction with sexual activity after AMI was similar for women and men. The relations between selected demographic and medical variables such as age, education, and perceived health before the first AMI and the frequency of and satisfaction with sexual activity of the women and men did not appear to be affected differently by the AMI. A first AMI appears to reduce the frequency of and satisfaction with sexual activity of women and men similarly 3 to 6 months after AMI."mycardial	Clinical	"This study aims to examine the situation for patients on the waiting list for possible coronary revascularization in terms of waiting time, treatment and various aspects of well-being in relation to gender. Patients on the waiting list for coronary angiography, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting in September 1990 were approached with a questionnaire dealing with various aspects as described above. Of the 831 patients who participated in the evaluation, 174 (21%) were women. Although age was similar for men and women, men had a higher prevalence of previous myocardial infarction and a lower prevalence of previous hypertension. In terms of medication, women were more frequently treated with diuretics and sedatives than men. Women reported a higher frequency than men with regard to the following symptoms: chest pain at rest and at night, dyspnoea when walking, tachycardia, tiredness, headache, dizziness and sweating. Women also suffered more frequently from difficulty going to sleep, difficulty waking up, repeated awakening and insomnia. Men, on the other hand, suffered more frequently from restlessness, inability to act and irritability. Among patients on the waiting list for possible coronary revascularization, women differed from men by being more frequently treated with diuretics, reporting a higher frequency of various cardiovascular symptoms including chest pain and dyspnoea and, furthermore, reporting more sleeping disorders. Gender differences were found but they were not consistent."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"We have previously demonstrated the effects of estrogen on modulation of myocardial ATP-sensitive K(+)(K(ATP)) channel. Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of mitochondrial K(ATP)channel is a major contributor of ischemic cardioprotection. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of K(ATP)channel in estrogen-induced myocardial protection after ischemia/reperfusion in dogs. Anaesthetized dogs were subjected to 60 min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 2 h of reperfusion. In a first study to characterize effects of sex and the dose-response profile of estrogen on infarct size, the drug was intravenously administered at 10 or 20 microg/kg. In a second study to investigate the cardioprotective mechanisms of estrogen, vehicle, preconditioning or 17 beta -estradiol (10 microg/kg) was given, beginning 15 min prior to the 60 min occlusion period in the presence or absence of 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD). In the first study, administration of 17 beta -estradiol resulted in a significant, dose-dependent limitation of infarct size. Estrogen administration provided myocardial protection of similar magnitude in both males and females. In the second study, infarct size in control animals averaged 39+/-5% of the risk region, compared with 14+/-5% of the risk region in estrogen-treated dogs and 6+/-5% of the risk region in preconditioning dogs (both P<0.0001 v controls). Pretreatment with 5-HD completely abolished preconditioning- and estrogen-induced cardioprotection. Estrogen limits myocardial infarction size resulting from coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion in a dose-dependent fashion, irrespective of gender difference. The infarct size-limiting effect of estrogen++ was abolished by 5-HD, suggesting that the cardioprotective effect of estrogen may result from activation of myocardial mitochondrial K(ATP)channels."mycardial	Outcomes	"Anxiety after acute myocardial infarction influences both short- and long-term recovery. Therefore, determining specific subgroups of patients who have relatively higher anxiety levels is important. Published findings about gender differences in anxiety after acute myocardial infarction are conflicting.To determine whether gender differences in anxiety after acute myocardial infarction exist and whether any of the sociodemographic and clinical variables that often differ between men and women with acute myocardial infarction interact with gender to influence anxiety.A total of 424 patients with confirmed acute myocardial infarction were enrolled in this multicenter prospective study. Patients' anxiety level was measured within 72 hours of their arrival at the hospital by using the State Anxiety Inventory and the Brief Symptom Inventory.Women had significantly higher anxiety than did men according to both the State Anxiety Inventory (42 +/- 12.9 vs 37.7 +/- 12.5; P = .001) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (0.83 +/- 0.97 vs 0.63 +/- 0.71; P = .02). Of the sociodemographic and clinical variables examined, only marital status and income significantly interacted with gender to influence anxiety. Married women had higher anxiety than did single and widowed women, and married men had lower anxiety than did single men. Women with lower income had higher anxiety than did women with higher income; income was not related to anxiety in men.Women report significantly greater anxiety early after acute myocardial infarction than men do. Women's greater anxiety may be partially explained by marital status and lower income at the time of the infarction."mycardial	Outcomes	"Epidemiologic studies of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have described gender differences in the time of death after infarction, with greater numbers of men dying before hospitalization than women. However, in controlled, hospital-based clinical trials, women die at higher rates than men. We hypothesized that evidence of a gender difference in the time of death following AMI may be found in controlled studies of hospitalized AMI patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO-1) and International Joint Efficacy Comparison of Thrombolytics (INJECT) trial databases using logistic regression modeling and time-to-death analyses. The age-adjusted female-to-male odds ratio for mortality was 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 1.5) in GUSTO-1 and 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 1.8) in INJECT. GUSTO-1 showed that among patients dying during the first 24 hours after symptom onset, men died an average of 1.7 hours earlier than women (p<0.001). This difference was due to earlier deaths among men < or =65 years of age. Furthermore, in GUSTO-1, the analysis of time to death in hour increments demonstrated that greater proportions of men died at earlier time points than women and a disproportionate number of early deaths occurred among younger men than among women of any age or older men. In INJECT, where time to death could only be analyzed in 1-day increments, no gender differences were evident. These results raise the possibility that the pattern of earlier death for men in thrombolytic clinical trials represents the continuation of a gender-specific mortality pattern that began before hospitalization. The death of a disproportionate number of men before hospitalization may represent an inherent gender bias for clinical studies enrolling only hospitalized patients. More high-risk men would be excluded from these studies than women because of death before hospitalization. Hence, gender comparisons of in-hospital mortality rates may artificially inflate values for women."mycardial	Management	"Coronary heart disease is the major cause of death of postmenopausal women in industrialised countries. Although acute myocardial infarction (AMI) affects men in greater numbers, the short-term outcomes for women are worse. In the longer term, studies suggest that mortality risk for women is lower or similar to that of men. However, length of follow up and adjustment for confounding factors have varied and more importantly, the association between treatment and outcomes has not been examined.To investigate the association between sex differences in risk factors and hospital treatment and mortality after AMI.A prospective observational study collecting demographic and clinical data on cases of AMI admitted to hospitals in Yorkshire. The main outcome measures were mortality status at discharge from hospital and two years later.All district and university hospitals accepting emergency admissions in the former Yorkshire National Health Service (NHS) region of northern England.3684 consecutive patients with a possible diagnosis of AMI admitted to hospitals in Yorkshire between 1 September and 30 November 1995.AMI was confirmed by the attending consultant for 2196 admissions (2153 people, 850 women and 1303 men). Women were older and less likely than men to be smokers or have a history of ischaemic heart disease. Crude inhospital mortality was higher for women (30% versus 19% for men, crude odds ratio of death before discharge for women 1.78, 95% confidence intervals 1.46, 2.18, p=0.00). This difference persisted after adjustment for age, risk factors and comorbidities (adjusted OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04, 1.63, p=0.02), but was not significant when treatment was taken into account. Women were less likely to be given thrombolysis (37% versus 46%, p<0.01) and aspirin (83% versus 90%, p<0.01), discharged with beta blockers (33% versus 47%, p<0.01) and aspirin (82% versus 88% p<0.01) or be scheduled for angiography, exercise testing or revascularisation. Adjustment for age removed much of the disparity in treatment. Crude mortality rate at two years was higher for women (OR 1.81, 95%CI 1.41, 2.31, p=0.00). Age, existing risk factors and acute treatment accounted for most of this difference, with treatment on discharge having little additional influence.Patients admitted to hospital with AMI should be offered optimal treatment irrespective of age or sex. Women have a worse prognosis after AMI and under-treatment of older people with aspirin and thrombolysis may be contributing to this."mycardial	Management	"We sought to determine the efficacy and safety of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor (GP IIb/IIIa) blockade with abciximab in women undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.Although gender differences in response to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockade have been described, there have been no large clinical studies to assess these differences.Outcomes were determined using meta-analysis technique.In the pooled analysis, the primary end point of death, myocardial infarction (MI) or urgent revascularization within 30 days was reduced from 11.3% to 5.8% (p<0.001) in men and from 12.7% to 6.5% (p<0.001) in women treated with abciximab. At six months, death, MI or urgent revascularization was reduced from 14.1% to 8.3% (p<0.001) in men and 16.0% to 9.9% (p<0.001) in women receiving abciximab. At one year, mortality was reduced from 2.7% to 1.9% (p = 0.06) in men and 4.0% to 2.5% (p = 0.03) in women treated with abciximab. Major bleeding events occurred in 2.9% versus 3.0% (p = 0.96) of women and 2.7% versus 1.3% (p = 0.003) of men treated with placebo versus abciximab, respectively. Minor bleeding events occurred in 4.7% versus 6.7% (p = 0.01) of women and 2.3% versus 2.2% (p = 0.94) of men treated with placebo versus abciximab, respectively.This pooled analysis demonstrated no gender difference in protection from major adverse outcomes with GP IIb/IIIa inhibition with abciximab. Although women had higher rates of both major and minor bleeding events with abciximab compared with men, major bleeding in women was similar with and without abciximab. There was a small increased risk of minor bleeding with abciximab in women."mycardial	Outcomes	"This study compares the clinical features, management, and outcome in men and women from a consecutive, unselected series of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who were admitted to a university cardiac center over a 3-year period. It is a retrospective observational study of 1,059 admissions with AMI identified through the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE) registry, validated according to Minnesota Manual criteria, and followed for a period of up to 5 years (median 36 months). Women comprised 40% of all admissions, had a higher hospital mortality (24% vs. 16%, p<0.001), and were less likely to receive thrombolysis (23% vs. 33%, p<0.01), admission to coronary care (65% vs. 77%, p<0.001), or subsequent invasive or noninvasive investigations (55% vs. 63%, p<0.01). However, women with AMI were older than men with AMI (71 vs. 65 years, p<0.001). After adjusting for age, differences that remained significant were prevalence of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 2.12, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.56 to 2.88) and cigarette smoking (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.65), management in coronary care (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.88), and hospital mortality (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.04). Excess mortality occurred predominantly in women <65 years old (18% vs. 8%, OR [multivariate] 2.35, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.56), among whom multivariate analysis demonstrated a significantly lower thrombolysis rate (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.86). In this group, lack of thrombolysis independently predicted hospital mortality (OR 5.37, 95% CI 1.45 to 19.82). Female gender was not an independent predictor of mortality following AMI (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.26). Thus, among unselected patients, female gender is associated with, but not an independent predictor of, reduced survival after AMI. Gender differences in mortality are greatest in younger patients, who are less likely to receive thrombolysis and in whom lack of thrombolysis is independently associated with mortality after AMI."mycardial	Management	"Recently it has been recognized that women are less likely than men to be diagnosed with a myocardial infarction (MI) or to receive early or aggressive treatment and are more likely than men to die of an MI. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the triage decisions made by ED nurses for persons with symptoms suggestive of MI. The theoretical framework for this investigation was Hammond's lens model for clinical inference and Evan's two-stage reasoning model.Four focus group sessions were conducted. The participant's oral descriptions were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the Krueger method.Content analysis revealed several important issues influencing triage decisions: patient presentation, nursing knowledge and experience, practice environment, intuition, the fear of liability, and gender-specific behaviors. ED nurses held different perceptions regarding the significance and likelihood of MI for male and female patients seeking evaluation and treatment. In addition, ED nurses admitted that MI is not the first diagnosis considered for middle-aged women.The inability of ED nurses to associate middle-aged women's presenting symptoms with MI may contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality experienced by this population. The findings of this study have implications for nursing research, education, and practice."mycardial	Outcomes	"Case fatality after myocardial infarction (MI) among patients admitted to the hospital may differ between men and women and blacks and whites. Furthermore, a different pattern of sex and race differences in case fatality may occur when coronary deaths outside the hospital are included in the analysis. The ARIC study provides community-based data to examine 28-day case fatality rates after coronary heart disease (CHD) events.Surveillance of out-of-hospital CHD deaths and hospitalized MI was conducted in 4 U.S. communities from 1987 to 1993. Hospital discharges and death certificates were sampled, medical records abstracted, and interviews conducted with witnesses of out-of-hospital deaths. MI and out-of-hospital death classifications followed a standard algorithm. Linkage of hospitalized MIs to fatality within 28 days ensured complete ascertainment of case fatality rate. Comorbidities and complications during hospital stay were compared to assess possible explanatory factors for differences in case fatality. Overall, age-adjusted 28-day case fatality (MI plus CHD) was higher in black men compared with white men (odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.2) and in black women compared with white women (odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1. 2-2.0). Although men had higher overall case fatality rates than did women, this difference was not statistically significant. After a hospitalized MI, 28-day case fatality rate was not statistically significantly different between men compared with women or blacks compared with whites.Race and sex differences in case fatality after hospitalized MI were not evident in these data, although when out-of-hospital deaths were included, men and blacks were more likely than women and whites to die within 28 days of an acute cardiac event. A majority of deaths occurred before hospital admission, and additional study of possible reasons for these differences should be a priority."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"The association between high plasma Lp(a) lipoprotein and coronary heart disease has been confirmed in numerous case/control and prospective studies. A high Lp(a) level has also been shown to be an independent genetic risk factor, while its inverse relationship with TGF-beta 1 has suggested that it may interfere with plasmin-mediated activation of TGF-beta 1 and result in increased endothelial activation, as well as migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate Lp(a) and TGF-beta 1 and their interactions in patients with first acute myocardial infarction (AMI).A total of 107 patients with first AMI and 103 age and sex-matched controls were studied. Very good agreement was found between QEI and RIA determinations of Lp(a) (p < 0.0001). Lp(a) levels were significantly elevated in cases (QEI: p < 0.031; RIA p < 0.002 respectively). Division by gender gave statistically significant differences in females only. Plasma levels of the active form of TGF-beta 1 were decreased in cases, though significantly (p < 0.029) in males only.Serum concentrations of Lp(a) and TGF-beta 1 are significantly altered in AMI patients. The differences are gender-dependent: Lp(a) is higher in females, and TGF-beta 1 is lower in males. Increased Lp(a) levels are accompanied by decreased active TGF-beta 1 levels and this inverse correlation is statistically significant (p < 0.001)."mycardial	Epidemiology	"A few studies have compared the smoking-related risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among women and men from the same population. A clear assessment of AMI risk among female smokers is now of major public health importance, given the large number of women who smoke.The study is based on two case-control studies, conducted in Italy between 1983 and 1992, including 429 women and 801 men with AMI, and 863 female and 976 male controls, in hospital for acute conditions, unrelated to tobacco consumption, other than cardio or cerebrovascular and neoplastic. Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by unconditional multiple logistic regression, including terms for study center, age, education, and other major risk factors of cardiovascular disease.Compared with non-smokers, the OR was 4.1 (95% CI 2.3-5.7) for female and 3.3 (95% CI 2.4-4.6) for male current smokers. The OR for smokers of <15 cigarettes per day was 2.4 for women and 2.1 for men; the sex difference was more evident for smokers of 15 to 24 cigarettes per day (OR 5.6 for women and 3.2 for men) and of >/= 25 cigarettes per day (OR 9.8 for women and 5.4 for men). The ORs in increasing duration categories were 3.6, 4.2, and 25.0 for women and 3.1, 3.9, and 3.2 for men. There was an inverse relation between the smoking-related risk of AMI and age among men, but no clear pattern with age was observed among women.Our study confirms that the relative risk of AMI is higher among female than among male smokers, and the difference is greater for heavy and long-term smokers."mycardial	Outcomes	"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of gender on the immediate and long-term postoperative morbidity, mortality, and patency rates for infrainguinal autogenous vein bypass grafts.Data were abstracted for consecutive patients who were followed in a prospective surveillance protocol after undergoing infrainguinal autogenous vein bypass grafting during the years 1988 to 1994. There were 165 grafts constructed in 148 patients (101 in 87 men, and 64 in 61 women). Gender differences were analyzed with Student t test or chi2 test for risk factors, indications for reconstruction, and complications. The patency rates and the long-term survival rates were compared by means of life-table analysis. Eagle criteria and long-term survival rates were compared with multivariate analysis.The mean follow-up period was 36 months (39 months for men, and 32 months for women), with a range of 6 to 123 months for the total follow-up period. The two groups did not differ in age at the time of operation (66.6 +/- 1.2 years for men, and 66.7 +/- 1.5 years for women) or in history of diabetes (48% for men, and 56% for women). The risks were similar for hypertension (48% for men vs 45% women), preoperative myocardial infarction (23% for men vs 26% for women), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (9% for men vs 8% for women). The thallium stress scintigraphy results showed a diagnosis of proportionately more preoperative defects in men (reversible, 34% vs 18%, P <.05; overall, 75% vs 43%, P <.05). The 30-day limb loss rates (0.9% for men, and 0% for women) and mortality rates (2.2% for men, and 5% for women) were similar. Women had statistically more perioperative myocardial infarctions than did men (6 of 61, 9.8% vs 2 of 101, 2%; P <.05), as was documented with electrocardiography and cardiac isoenzymes. Two of these women died within a 30-day postoperative period. The 3-year primary patency rate was 85% for the men and 88% for the women, and the primary assisted patency rate was 97% for the men and 97% for the women. The secondary patency rate was 98% for the men and 97% for the women. The limb salvage rate was slightly higher for the men than for the women (93% vs 87%), although this was not statistically significant. The 5-year survival rate for women was statistically less than for men, with life-table analysis (58% for men vs 42% for women; P <.05).After distal bypass grafting, men and women have similar rates of patency and limb salvage, but women have a higher incidence rate of perioperative myocardial infarction and a decreased 5-year survival rate. These data suggest that women have unrecognized cardiac disease that affects them adversely in the perioperative period and the long term when compared with men who undergo the same operation."mycardial	Epidemiology	"The purpose of this study was to prospectively examine the risk of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a large, nationally representative sample of very old men and women.We utilized secondary analysis of the Longitudinal Study of Aging. Baseline (1984) in-person interview data were linked to Medicare hospitalization records for 1984-1991. Subjects were 6,071 noninstitutionalized adults 70 years old or older at baseline. Hospitalization for AMI was defined as having primary discharge diagnoses containing ICD9-CM 410 codes. Multivariable proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the epidemiologic risks for all persons, and separately for women, men, self-respondents, those with no previous AMIs, and those with no history of coronary heart disease.Of the sample, 357 persons (5.9%; 172 women and 185 men) had at least one primary discharge diagnosis of AMI. Significant (p<.05) risk factors for being hospitalized with an AMI (adjusted hazards ratios in parentheses) from the pooled analysis were male gender (1.86), having no more than a grade school education (1.35), atherosclerosis (1.43), hypertension (1.29), coronary heart disease (1.63), angina (1.60), previous AMI (1.52), diabetes (1.89), and four or more lower body limitations (1.43). The gender-specific analyses, however, revealed that hypertension, angina, diabetes, and lower body limitations were risk factors only for women, and that having no more than a grade school education was a risk factor only for men.Men, especially those with low education, women with diabetes, angina, hypertension, or lower body limitations, and either men or women with previous AMIs, coronary heart disease, or atherosclerosis have elevated risks for AMI resulting in hospitalization, and they should be considered for evaluation and monitoring. Current protocols for therapeutic management should be adopted, and compliance should be encouraged."mycardial	Outcomes	"There is conflicting information about whether short-term mortality after myocardial infarction is higher among women than among men after adjustment for age and other prognostic factors. We hypothesized that younger, but not older, women have higher mortality rates during hospitalization than their male peers.We analyzed data on 384,878 patients (155,565 women and 229,313 men) who were 30 to 89 years of age and who had been enrolled in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 2 between June 1994 and January 1998. Patients who had been transferred from or to other hospitals were excluded.The overall mortality rate during hospitalization was 16.7 percent among the women and 11.5 percent among the men. Sex-based differences in the rates varied according to age. Among patients less than 50 years of age, the mortality rate for the women was more than twice that for the men. The difference in the rates decreased with increasing age and was no longer significant after the age of 74 (P< 0.001 for the interaction between sex and age). Logistic-regression analysis showed that the odds of death were 11.1 percent greater for women than for men with every five-year decrease in age (95 percent confidence interval, 10.1 to 12.1 percent). Differences in medical history, the clinical severity of the infarction, and early management accounted for only about one third of the difference in the risk. After adjustment for these factors, women still had a higher risk of death for every five years of decreasing age (increase in the odds of death, 7.0 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 5.9 to 8.1 percent).After myocardial infarction, younger women, but not older women, have higher rates of death during hospitalization than men of the same age. The younger the age of the patients, the higher the risk of death among women relative to men. Younger women with myocardial infarction represent a high-risk group deserving of special study."mycardial	Outcomes	"To study the gender differences in presentation, diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction in Lebanon.Consecutive admissions due to myocardial infarction to 18 medical centers in various regions of Lebanon were entered into the Lebanese Myocardial Infarction Study, conducted between January and July 1996. Information was obtained on age, gender, time of onset of symptoms, delay to hospital arrival, mode of transport, and coronary risk factor analysis. The patients were followed up in hospital for analysis of modes of therapy, complications and mortality.Of 433 admissions, 99 were female. Compared to men, women were older, presented later, smoked less but tended to have a higher frequency of hypertension. The other coronary risk factors were similarly prevalent in males and females. Inotropic agents were used more commonly in females but thrombolytics were used less so. Women tended to develop more heart failure and had significantly higher incidence of recurrent ischemia or myocardial infarction, high level atrioventricular block and atrial arrhythmias. The overall mortality rate was higher in females than in males (16.2% vs. 8.1%, P = 0.037).The results reveal similarities between gender differences among Lebanese and Western populations. The higher mortality rate in women may relate to the late arrival to hospital, the older age and the more frequent complications. This emphasizes the need to educate women about coronary risk and to urge them to seek early medical care."mycardial	Outcomes	"To compare levels of fear and the intensity of specific fears in women and men related to coronary arteriography (CA).Prospective survey.A 1360-bed university hospital. Data were collected before, during, and after CA, and again 6 months later.The sample consisted of 54 women and 166 men undergoing scheduled CA.To compare fear levels at different points of evaluation; two analyses of covariance for repeated measures were performed.On average, women had significantly higher mean scores of fear across the points of evaluation on the Visual Analogue Scale than men (P <.001). During the hospital stay, the most intense fear for both women and men was the fear of coronary artery bypass grafting and the uncertainty about the illness, whereas at home it was the fear of myocardial infarction. On average, women reported significantly intense fears more frequently than men across time. On average, men experienced more intensive fear of problems in their sex life than women (P =. 032). The changes in intensity of fears over time were not significantly different by gender, except in fear of pain (P =.013), health care staff not having enough time to care for the patient (P =.039), and health care staff discussing the patient's condition without the patient being present (P =.048). Age and prior CA were found to be significantly related to most of the fears at different points of evaluation, and to the changes of fears over time.There existed differences in the tendency to report intensity of fears by gender; however, the intensity of fears changed in a similar way over time. The results suggest that the few gender differences in fears that existed may be explained by the treatment chosen for the patients and the patients' acceptance of it. Therefore, it is important to adapt information and support according to the treatment chosen for the patient."mycardial	Outcomes	"The purpose of this study was to assess gender differences in the impact of depression on 1-year cardiac mortality in patients hospitalized for an acute myocardial infarction (MI).Secondary analysis was performed on data from two studies that used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess depression symptoms during hospitalization: a prospective study of post-MI risk and a randomized trial of psychosocial intervention (control group only). The sample included 896 patients (283 women) who survived to discharge and received usual posthospital care. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk of 1-year cardiac mortality associated with baseline BDI scores.There were 290 patients (133 women) with BDI scores > or =10 (at least mild to moderate symptoms of depression); 8.3% of the depressed women died of cardiac causes in contrast to 2.7% of the nondepressed. For depressed men, the rate of cardiac death was 7.0% in contrast to 2.4% of the nondepressed. Increased BDI scores were significantly related to cardiac mortality for both genders [the odds ratio for women was 3.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-10.59); for men, the odds ratio was 3.05 (95% CI = 1.29-7.17)]. Control for other multivariate predictors of mortality in the data set (age, Killip class, the interactions of gender by non-Q wave MI, gender by left ventricular ejection fraction, and gender by smoking) did not change the impact of the BDI for either gender.Depression in hospital after MI is a significant predictor of 1-year cardiac mortality for women as well as for men, and its impact is largely independent of other post-MI risks."mycardial	Outcomes	"To examine the effect of gender differences among older adults hospitalized for an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on subsequent health outcomes.Secondary analysis of the Longitudinal Study on Aging. Data from baseline interviews (1984) and three biennial (1986, 1988, and 1990) re-interviews were linked to Medicare hospitalization and National Death Index records for 1984-1991.A total of 6071 community-dwelling adults aged 70 years or older at baseline.Pooled and stratified multivariable models were used to examine gender differences in the independent effects of being hospitalized for an AMI on all-cause mortality, the risk and volume of subsequent hospitalization, and increases in the number of functional limitations. Two comparison groups were used.Three hundred fifty-seven AMI cases (6%; 172 women and 185 men) were compared with 3976 hospitalized controls and 1738 nonhospitalized controls. The risk of all-cause mortality for AMI cases was greater than that for either hospitalized controls or nonhospitalized controls (referent), and this increased risk was significantly (P < .001) stronger for women (adjusted hazards ratio (AHR) = 14.24, 95%CI = 10.99, 18.46) than for men (AHR = 9.91, 95%CI = 7.75, 12.67). Overall, AMI cases were also more likely to be hospitalized subsequently than the hospitalized controls (referent; adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.17, 1.85), although in the stratified analysis this association held for men (AOR = 1.73, 95%CI = 1.25, 2.41) but not for women (AOR = 1.25, 95%CI = .90, 1.73). Among those subsequently hospitalized, both women and men AMI cases consumed more hospital resources than the hospitalized controls, and there were gender differences suggesting that the effects on total charges and length of stay were greater for women than for men with AMI. Finally, although the AMI cases had greater adjusted mean increases in the number of instrumental activities of daily living limitations and lower body limitations than the nonhospitalized controls, they were no worse off than the hospitalized controls, and there were no gender differences in those effects.Relative to the appropriate comparison groups, hospitalization for an AMI increases the risk of death and the total costs and lengths of stay of subsequent hospitalizations for women more than for men. Therefore, increased primary prevention, diagnosis, and treatment efforts should be directed toward women."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Cardiovascular disease is still portrayed as a typical male disease, and men are more often submitted to invasive procedures or referred earlier.To explore sex differences in morbidity and referral patterns in cardiovascular disease in general practice, and the role of age and socioeconomic status.Data were obtained from a continuous morbidity registration project in the Netherlands from 1986 to 1995 in which 12,000 patients were followed over 10 years. The effects of sex, age, and socioeconomic status on morbidity of cardiovascular disease and the referral patterns were established.The sex difference in morbidity becomes smaller with increasing age. Morbidity was highest in the lower socioeconomic status in general and for angina pectoris in particular. Women with angina pectoris with low socioeconomic status have a relative risk of 2.24 (CI = 1.17-3.26) compared with women with high socioeconomic status. In men, no significant difference was found between the socioeconomic status groups. For angina pectoris the sex difference in referral to the specialist was most significant: 50.6% and 26.6% (P = 0.002) for men and women respectively.For women, low socioeconomic status was associated with relatively higher morbidity of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction than for men. Women are less likely to be referred than men are, in particular for angina pectoris."mycardial	Review	"Many previous studies have shown that there is a gender difference in terms of the use of diagnostic procedures and the treatment of patients with chest pain. The mechanisms behind these observations are less well described. This survey describes gender differences in the aetiology of chest pain and symptoms associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Among the patients with symptoms of acute chest pain, in the emergency medical department women less frequently develop an AMI and are less frequently given a diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease. Among patients developing an AMI, women differ from men by less frequently reporting chest pain, more frequently reporting nausea, vomiting, abdominal complaints, fatigue and dyspnoea and less frequently reporting sweating. With regard to the localization of pain in AMI, women differ from men by more frequently reporting pain in the back, neck and jaw. In terms of electrocardiographic changes, women seem to have less marked ST deviations than men. However, we do not believe that these differences between women and men are substantial enough and, as a result, we do not recommend that the initial medical care of patients seeking medical attention with chest pain or other symptoms raising a suspicion of AMI should be differentiated with regard to gender. The differences described here might partly explain the prolonged delay until hospital admission in women suffering from AMI."mycardial	Management	"To investigate gender differences in baseline characteristics, presentation, and treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) admitted to the University of Wisconsin Hospital Coronary Care Unit (CCU) over a 1-year period.A retrospective review was performed on the charts of all patients (n = 293) admitted to the CCU in 1996 with a discharge diagnosis of acute MI. In 83 women and 187 men with analyzable data (n = 270), 42 factors related to baseline characteristics, presentation, treatment, and outcomes were identified and analyzed for gender differences.On average, women were 5 years older than men (p < .01). By univariate comparison, women were less likely than men to be smokers (p < .001); more likely to have underlying hypertension (p < .01), diabetes mellitus (p < 0.05), non-Q-wave infarctions (p < .01), and congestive heart failure (CHF, p < .05); and more likely to have received diuretics (p < .001) and ACE inhibitors (p < .01). While women were less likely than men to undergo coronary angiography (p < .05) and more likely to have echocardiograms (p < 0.05), rates of coronary artery bypass graft surgery, angioplasty, and the use of thrombolytics were similar for men and women. Clinical outcomes were similar in both groups. CHF, hypertension, and use of ACE inhibitors remained the only significant gender differences when data were adjusted for age.Comparing men and women with acute MI at UW Hospital revealed some differences in clinical characteristics and management. Except for CHF, hypertension, and use of ACE inhibitors (all of which may be related), these differences disappeared when the data were adjusted for age. This is particularly notable for the disappearance of the difference in the use of coronary angiography between men and women. The comparable use of beta-blockers, aspirin, and nitrates, and the similar clinical outcomes in men and women, suggest less gender difference in MI management at UW Hospital than reported in other studies."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"According to official statistical data there is a significant difference between pre-menopausal women and age-matched men in morbidity and mortality from cardiac diseases and especially from myocardial infarction. There are several speculations regarding the nature of this phenomenon which have both supporting and refuting evidence. Our hypothesis was that due to regular physiologic bleeding, rheological properties of blood of pre-menopausal women are superior to those of men, and place such women at a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases than men in any age group. We believe that this difference in hemorheological properties is due to the reduced concentration of red blood cells (RBCs) and due to greater population of younger and less population of older RBCs in female blood. We studied mechanical properties of blood from 47 pre-menopausal women and 50 age-matched men. Compared to female blood, male blood had higher viscosity and RBC aggregation and lower RBC deformability. Oxygen Delivery Index, calculated as a ratio of hematocrit to blood viscosity, was found to be significantly lower in male blood. Decreased oxygen delivery along with increased RBC aggregation and decreased RBC deformability may contribute to the higher risk for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Regular blood donation may reduce hematocrit and blood viscosity, improve rheological properties of blood, and increase oxygen delivery in men."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Previous studies suggest that gender affects the adaptive responses of the heart to some forms of cardiac overload. It is unknown whether gender influences left ventricular (LV) remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI).We performed transthoracic echocardiographic-Doppler examinations in age-matched male (n = 17) and female (n = 16) rats before, and 1 and 6 weeks after transmural MI or sham surgery.Following large MI (male = 45 +/- 1% LV circumference vs. female = 48 +/- 4%, p = NS), both male and female rats developed progressive LV dilatation. Infarctions caused a similar degree of global and regional LV systolic dysfunction in males and females. Male rats had significant increases in the thickness of the noninfarcted posterior wall by 6 weeks after MI. However, posterior wall thickness did not change in the infarcted female rats. Average myocyte diameter in the noninfarcted region of the heart was also greater in male than female MI rats. The combination of increased cavity size with little change in wall thickness resulted in a greater decline in relative wall thickness in the female rats compared to the males. Male rats with MI showed progressively restricted LV diastolic filling as assessed by transmitral Doppler recordings. Female rats had less of an increase in the ratio of early to late transmitral velocities and less of an increase in the E wave deceleration rate after MI.Female rats showed a different pattern of LV remodeling than males with less of an increase in thickness of the noninfarcted portions of the left ventricle than males, but comparable LV cavity enlargement and systolic dysfunction. Despite similar infarct size, females developed less pronounced abnormalities of LV diastolic filling. We hypothesize that the gender-related differences in postinfarction LV remodeling may contribute to the different LV filling patterns, and might ultimately relate to differences in clinical outcome."mycardial	Management	"Reports on gender differences in the management of acute coronary syndromes indicate that women do not receive as much active treatment as men. Other conflicting findings have also been published. To investigate whether previously reported gender differences in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) still persist, we included all patients admitted to our coronary care unit (CCU) in 1984-1995, and discharged with a diagnosis of AMI, in a retrospective study. A total of 1991 female admissions was compared with 4067 male admissions. The time-span was divided into two-year periods comprising approximately 1000 patients each. During one period, 1988 to 1989, women received significantly less thrombolytic therapy which, however, could reflect that women admitted with AMI were older than men. Analysis of time-trends showed a significant increase in the use of thrombolytic treatment in women and elderly men. In clinical praxis there has been a gender-gap in acute treatment of AMI, but age-dependent or not, this is now no longer apparent."mycardial	Review	"With many risk factors for cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction in particular now being well defined, it becomes increasingly clear that a majority of these factors are not only age, but also gender specific. Confidential risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight and hyperlipaemia, might have a different impact in women than in men. Moreover, there are substantial clinical differences between male and female ischaemic heart disease, both as to presentation, as well as to diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. In addition to a discussion to the risk factors mentioned above, the cardioprotective actions of oestrogens will be reviewed."mycardial	Outcomes	"Studies of sex differences in mortality after myocardial infarction (MI) have shown conflicting results.To test the hypothesis that sex differences in mortality after MI vary according to patients' age, with younger women, but not older women, having a higher mortality compared with men.We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1025 consecutive patients who met accepted criteria for MI in 1992 and 1993 in 15 Connecticut hospitals. Data for the study were abstracted from medical records.Women had a 40% higher hospital mortality rate than men. Simple age adjustment eliminated the sex difference in mortality rate (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.48). However, when the sample was subdivided into 2 age groups, women younger than 75 years showed twice as high a mortality rate as men in the same age group, while among older patients no difference in mortality was found. In multivariate analyses the interaction of sex with age was highly significant, even after adjusting for comorbid conditions, clinical severity, process of care, and hospital characteristics. In the fully adjusted model, this interaction indicated that among patients younger than 75 years women had 49% higher odds of hospital death than men, while in the age group 75 years or older women had 46% lower odds of death compared with men.A higher mortality of women compared with men after MI is confined to the younger age groups. The sex-age interaction should be considered when examining sex differences in mortality after MI."mycardial	Management	"To find out in a sample of coronary patients at entry into a cardiac rehabilitation program, whether women report a lower level of physical functioning and a higher degree of psychosocial impairment than men.One hundred and nine male and 122 female patients matched for age with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, or coronary angioplasty were assessed at entry into a multidisciplinary outpatient rehabilitation program. Information was retrieved from hospital records, a semistructured interview, and several psychological questionnaires. Variables of physical functioning included perceived exercise tolerance, functional complaints, psychosomatic complaints, and sleeping disturbances. Variables of psychosocial impairment included anxiety, depression, vital exhaustion, well-being, feelings of being disabled, displeasure, and social inhibition.At program entry, there were no significant differences in age, coronary risk factors, coronary incident, or medication between genders. However, women reported significantly lower perceived exercise tolerance and significantly more functional and psychosomatic complaints. Moreover, women were significantly more anxious and scored significantly higher on social inhibition and vital exhaustion than men.At entry into rehabilitation, women in this sample report a higher degree of psychosocial impairment and a lower level of physical functioning than men. Women's significantly higher scores on social inhibition and vital exhaustion might partly explain their reported higher drop-out and lower adherence rates in cardiac rehabilitation."mycardial	Management	"A significant proportion of eligible patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to document patterns of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation use and identify factors predicting its use.The Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry of the Minnesota Heart Survey enrolled 3,841 patients admitted on suspicion of acute myocardial infarction (MI) to the coronary care units at six Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan hospitals. Participants were contacted 1 year after index hospitalization and asked if they participated in cardiac rehabilitation since discharge.Among those discharged with a MI, 47% participated in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation or an exercise program at an exercise facility, home, or both during the 1-year follow-up period. Among those discharged with angina, 21% attended cardiac rehabilitation. Usage increased when cardiac revascularization procedures were performed during the index hospitalization. Women with an angina or MI diagnosis were significantly less likely to use cardiac rehabilitation than men. Older patients were also less likely to use rehabilitation, with gender difference persisting across age strata. As education increased, cardiac rehabilitation utilization increased. Those not employed were less likely to use cardiac rehabilitation services. The strongest independent predictors of cardiac rehabilitation utilization were age and revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting or coronary angioplasty), simultaneously adjusting for demographic information, and cardiovascular disease risk factors.These data suggest that there is a disparity in cardiac rehabilitation utilization with lower rates among women, older individuals, those with less education, and the unemployed."mycardial	Management	"To determine whether there are sex differences in the demographics, treatment, and outcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction in the United States, data from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction-I from September 1990 to September 1994 were examined.The National Registry of Myocardial Infarction-I is a national observational database consisting of 1234 US hospitals in which each hospital submits data from each patient with acute myocardial infarction to a central data collection center. For these analyses, the following variables were examined in 354 435 patients with acute myocardial infarction: demographics; use of medical therapy including thrombolytic agents; use of procedures including cardiac catheterization, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass surgery; length of hospital stay; adverse events (stroke, major bleeding, or recurrent myocardial infarction); and causes of death.In comparison with men, women experiencing acute myocardial infarction in the United States are older, with 55.7% older than 70 years. Women have a higher mortality rate than men even when controlled for age and die less often from arrhythmia but more often from cardiac rupture whether or not thrombolytic therapy is used. Treatment with aspirin, heparin, or beta-blockers is less frequent in women. When thrombolytic therapy is used, women are treated an average of almost 14 minutes later than men and experience a greater incidence of major bleeding. Cardiac catheterization, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass surgery are used less often in women.Observations from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction-I document important sex differences in demographics, treatment, and outcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction in the United States."mycardial	Outcomes	"The mortality patterns of coronary heart disease (CHD) vary among countries. Although the mortality rates from this disease are decreasing in the majority of developed nations, most developing countries are experiencing upward trends, especially among men. The mortality trends of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Taiwan have not been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of age, chronicle period, and birth cohort on the AMI mortality rates using computerized vital statistics data from 1974 through 1993. Compared with the age-adjusted AMI mortality rates in 1974, the mortality rates in 1993 were 2.4 times higher for men and 2.2 times higher for women. When the log-linear Poisson model was used to assess age, birth cohort, and chronicle period simultaneously, women had no elevated relative risk of dying from AMI in different periods. The relative risk of dying from AMI increased 2.5 times for men in the 1955-1959 birth cohort compared with those in the 1890-1894 birth cohort, while the relative risk for females declined by 3.7 times for the corresponding birth cohorts. Based on birth cohort, the trends in mortality differ substantially between sexes in Taiwan. These results may help to generate hypotheses regarding the possible factors, prevention, and control of mortality from AMI in Taiwan."mycardial	Management	"The goal of this study was to examine sex differences in the use of coronary angiography after acute myocardial infarction in managed care facilities by using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) practice guidelines (which incorporate clinical information on infarct complications, severity of illness, and comorbidity).Although sex differences in the use of coronary angiography after acute myocardial infarction have been previously explored, the effects of indications for coronary angiography and common health insurance coverage on the sex and coronary angiography use relation have not been previously examined.This historical prospective study analyzed data collected from a random sample of 1133 patients (377 women, 756 men) from among 2740 patients hospitalized with validated acute myocardial infarction between Jan. 1, 1990, and Dec. 31, 1992, from seven of 16 Northern California Kaiser Facilities (three with high procedure rates for coronary angiography, four with low rates relative to the average region-wide utilization rate). In accordance with the guidelines, use of coronary angiography was determined for the in-hospital and ""0 to 8 weeks"" postdischarge periods. Patients were assigned time specific ACC/AHA classes for coronary angiography indications (I = highly indicated, IIA = probably indicated, IIB = not harmful, III = not indicated). The independent impact of ACC/AHA class, age, race, and facility on the sex and use of coronary angiography relation was examined by the Cox proportional hazard model.Accounting only for ACC/AHA class, fewer women underwent coronary angiography compared with men among the ""highly indicated"" class I patients during the in-hospital period (43% vs 35%; p < 0.05), but not after discharge. Use of coronary angiography between the sexes was not statistically different among classes IIA, IIB, and III for both periods. After adjusting for differences in age, race, facility, and ACC/AHA class, we found no sex difference in in-hospital use of coronary angiography (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.26), but among those discharged without receiving coronary angiography, women probably received fewer angiograms than did men (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.00). For both periods, no significant sex difference in use of coronary angiography was found within ACC/AHA classes after adjustments.In a setting where health insurance is prepaid and after controlling for ACC/AHA classification for coronary angiography indications, age, race, and facility, use of coronary angiography after myocardial infarction was similar among men and women during hospitalization, but was lower among women after discharge. Likely explanations for these differences in use of coronary angiography may include effects of physician judgment, patient decision, other social factors, or clinical information not captured in the practice guidelines."mycardial	Management	"We prospectively studied the gender differences of baseline variables, therapies, and outcomes among a cohort of 369 Chinese patients with acute myocardial infarction from 1990 to 1995. There were 277 male and 92 female patients. The male gender had a younger mean (+/-SD) age (61.5+/-10.7 vs. 67.1+/-11.7 years, P<0.0001). Hypercholesterolemia (201.2+/-44.2 vs. 187.5+/-43.7 mg/dl, P=0.0111) and obesity (25.0 vs. 15.9%, P=0.0494) were more prominent in the female. Smoking was more prevalent in the male (78.3 vs. 18.5%, P<0.0001). The male group also had more frequent use of thrombolytic agents (19.1 vs. 9.8%, P=0.0377), beta-blockers (61.7 vs. 47.8%, P=0.0191) and heparin (25.3 vs. 12.0%, P=0.0075); but less use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (6.9 vs. 15.2%, P=0.0149). The condition on admission was worse in the female group (Killip classification (1.5+/-0.9 vs. 1.9+/-1.0, P=0.0022), myocardial failure (8.7 vs. 2.9%, P=0.0178) and cardiomegaly (65.2 vs. 53.1%, P=0.0419). During a follow-up duration of 26.4+/-24.1 and 22.9+/-23.9 months respectively, the mortality rate was lower in the male (19.5 vs. 30.4%, P=0.0288). However after adjustment for the effect of age, the differences in Killip classification, myocardial failure, cardiomegaly and mortality became insignificant."mycardial	Review	"Reports from several countries indicate that women are disadvantaged in the treatment of coronary heart disease. The aim of the present review is to examine--on the basis of current population-based data (National Health Survey [NHS], hospital diagnosis registry, mortality rates)--whether in the Federal Republic of Germany more recently a change in favor of women could be established. According to NHS results prevalence rates of hypertension, overweight, and smoking in men exceed those of women, whereas hypercholesterolaemia is equally prevalent in both sexes. From 1984/85 to 1990/91 the NHS revealed a marked decline of smoking in men, and a parallel increase in women. The prevalence of chest pain shows no gender difference, but chest pain in men is more predictive for coronary artery disease. In acute myocardial infarction [AMI] thrombolysis and PTCA are applied with equal frequency; the average length of stay in hospital is greater for women. Coronary bypass surgery and rehabilitation in hospitals are less frequently applied in women. Little is known about gender differences in psychosocial adaptation after AMI. AMI mortality rates in all age groups are lower in women, and their mean age of death is higher. However, the decline of AMI mortality since 1980 was less pronounced in women compared to men."mycardial	Clinical	"A retrospective observational study using database registry of consecutive patients admitted to 16 King County hospital Coronary Care Units (CCU) was conducted to assess gender differences in symptom presentation for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and investigate how symptom presentation relates to prehospital delay time interval from acute symptom onset to emergency department (ED) presentation. Between January 1991 and February 1993, 4,497 patients were admitted to the CCUs with diagnosed AMI. Accredited record technicians abstracted age, gender, race, transport method, symptom presentation (chest pain, sweating, nausea, shortness of breath, epigastric pain, and fainting), delay time interval between acute symptom onset and presentation to hospital ED, and discharge diagnosis from the patients' medical records. After adjusting for age and history of diabetes, no gender differences remained for frequencies of chest pain, fainting, or epigastric pain. Women reported more nausea and shortness of breath but less sweating than men as symptoms of AMI. Chest pain, sweating, and fainting were associated with decreasing delay time intervals. Age, gender, histories of AMI and diabetes, and transport choice were also significantly related to delay time interval. These results show that gender differences occur in AMI symptom experience. However, how symptoms relate to the gender gap in delay time interval is not clear. These findings suggest that health care professionals need to tailor information about possible symptoms of AMI to the patient's gender, age, and medical history."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"We sought to determine whether there are gender-related differences in autonomic and hemodynamic responses to abrupt coronary occlusion.The risk of sudden death before hospital admission is higher in men with an acute myocardial infarction. The reasons for this gender-related difference are not well understood. Cardiovascular autonomic regulation modifies the outcome of acute coronary events, and there are gender differences in the autonomic regulation of heart rate (HR) in normal physiologic circumstances.We analyzed the changes in HR, HR variability and blood pressure and the occurrence of ventricular ectopic beats during a 2-min coronary occlusion in 140 men and 65 women referred for single-vessel coronary angioplasty. The ranges of nonspecific responses were determined by analyzing a control group of 19 patients with no ischemia during a 2-min balloon inflation in a totally occluded coronary artery.Women more often had ST segment changes (p < 0.01) and chest pain (p < 0.05) during the occlusion. Significant bradycardia or increase in HR variability as a sign of vagal activation occurred more often in women than in men (31% vs. 13%, p < 0.01 and 25% vs. 11%, p < 0.05, respectively). Coronary occlusion also more often caused (28% vs. 11%, p < 0.01) a decrease in blood pressure in women. The most pronounced female preponderance was in the incidence of Bezold-Jarisch-type reaction (i.e., simultaneous bradycardia and decrease in blood pressure [16% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.0001]). Logistic regression models developed to analyze the significance of gender while controlling for baseline variables and signs of ischemia identified female gender to be an independent predictor of bradycardic reactions (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 7.7, p < 0.01), hypotensive reactions (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.0, p < 0.05) and Bezold-Jarisch-type response (OR 22.2, 95% CI 2.5 to 200, p < 0.01). Significance of female gender as a protector against early coronary occlusion-induced ventricular ectopic beats emerged as having borderline significance (OR 0.4, CI 0.1 to 1.1, p = 0.07).Vagal activation is more common in women than in men during abrupt coronary occlusion and may have beneficial antiarrhythmic effects, modifying the outcome of acute coronary events."mycardial	Management	"Concern has been expressed that women are not adequately represented in clinical trials evaluating treatments for medical conditions they commonly experience. This study was designed to assess the reporting of data on women in recently published trials of drug therapy for myocardial infarction, including those funded by an agency with a gender-related policy.All randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of drug therapies for myocardial infarction published in The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, The Journal of the American Medical Association, the Annals of Internal Medicine and the British Medical Journal from January 1992 to December 1996 were evaluated. On preliminary review 102 articles met the inclusion criteria; these were reviewed in detail, and 59 were excluded. Two reviewers independently extracted gender-related information from the 43 articles; discrepancies were resolved by consensus.Women presented up to 48% of the trial participants (mean 24.1%). In the trials funded by an agency with a gender-related policy, only 16.8% of participants, on average, were women. Of the 43 articles in the sample, only 14 (32%) provided gender-related results. Funding from an agency with gender-related policy did not affect the reporting of gender-related information. Subgroup analyses were provided for 14 (32%) of the 43 trials, including 2 (29%) of 7 trials funded by an agency with a gender-related policy. Of the 12 trials that included interaction analyses (excluding the 2 trials in which secondary analyses were conducted specifically to identify differences between women and men), 7 (58%) conducted an interaction analysis to determine if women responded differently than men; for one of these the interaction analysis was for a secondary outcome measure (drug safety). Only 5 (12%) of the 43 articles mentioned the differences between men and women in the Discussion section; 2 of these were studies that used secondary analyses to examine sex differences. Of the 5, only 1 was funded by an agency with a gender-related policy.Women were poorly represented in the randomized controlled trials in this sample, regardless of whether the trials were funded by an agency with a gender-related policy. Structured reporting of gender-related information for clinical trials may improve the quality of information available about women and therefore facilitate the application of research findings to the care of women."mycardial	Clinical	"To describe sex differences in symptom presentation after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) while controlling for differences in age and other potentially confounding factors.Although several studies have examined sex differences in diagnosis, management, and survival after AMI, limited data exist about possible sex differences in symptom presentation in the setting of AMI.Community-based study of patients hospitalized with confirmed AMI in all 16 metropolitan Worcester, Mass., hospitals (1990 census population = 437,000). Men (n = 810) and women (n = 550) hospitalized with validated AMI in 1986 and 1988 comprised the study sample.After simultaneously controlling for age, medical history, and AMI characteristics through regression modeling, men were significantly less likely to complain of neck pain (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.78), back pain (OR = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.56), jaw pain (OR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.81), and nausea (O.R. = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.75) than women. Conversely, men were significantly more likely to report diaphoresis (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.61) than women. There were no statistically significant sex differences in complaints of chest pain though men were more likely to complain of this symptom.The results of this population-based observational study suggest differences in symptom presentation in men and women hospitalized with AMI. These findings have implications for public and health care provider education concerning recognition of sex differences in AMI-related symptoms and health care seeking behaviors."mycardial	Epidemiology	"To compare risk of myocardial infarction associated with smoking in men and women, taking into consideration differences in smoking behaviour and a number of potential confounding variables.Prospective cohort study with follow up of myocardial infarction.Pooled data from three population studies conducted in Copenhagen.11,472 women and 13,191 men followed for a mean of 12.3 years.First admission to hospital or death caused by myocardial infarction.1251 men and 512 women had a myocardial infarction during follow up. Compared with non-smokers, female current smokers had a relative risk of myocardial infarction of 2.24 (range 1.85-2.71) and male smokers 1.43 (1.26-1.62); ratio 1.57 (1.25-1.97). Relative risk of myocardial infarction increased with tobacco consumption in both men and women and was higher in inhalers than in non-inhalers. The risks associated with smoking, measured by both current and accumulated tobacco exposure, were consistently higher in women than in men and did not depend on age. This sex difference was not affected by adjustment for arterial blood pressure, total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, triglyceride concentrations, diabetes, body mass index, height, alcohol intake, physical activity, and level of education.Women may be more sensitive than men to some of the harmful effects of smoking. Interactions between components of smoke and hormonal factors that may be involved in development of ischaemic heart disease should be examined further."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Heart disease is the leading cause of death among women in the United States. The prognosis for heart disease is worse for women than for men. Also, although women are less likely than men to initially present with a myocardial infarction (MI), they are more likely to die following an MI. A number of factors have been identified that partially account for the gender difference in post-MI morbidity and mortality. However, limited data are available on the sex differences in clinical, psychosocial, and demographic factors that may combine to explain the poorer prognosis for women following an acute MI. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trials collected detailed demographic, clinical, and psychosocial data on 2,043 men and 448 women following acute MIs. Analyses indicate that women had a worse clinical, socioeconomic, and psychosocial profile than did men. In addition, significant differences in psychosocial profiles persisted after controlling for demographic and clinical data, suggesting that women presenting with MIs have a cluster of complex factors that put them at high risk for morbidity and mortality following an MI. Future longitudinal studies that include adequate numbers of women as well as reliable assessments of both clinical and psychological variables are needed to better understand the factors that influence the poor prognosis for women with coronary heart disease."mycardial	Management	"This study was undertaken to study gender differences in the use of coronary angiography (CA), revascularization (RV), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in patient with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who were assigned to ""High Indication for CA"" per the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/ AHA) practice guidelines.This is a historical prospective study based on a stratified random sample of 1165 AMI patients from January 1990 to December 1992 at seven health maintenance organization hospitals. CA was highly indicated in 286 women and 564 men. In a Cox hazard ratio (HR), women received significantly (P<.05) fewer CAs (HR, .78) and RVs (HR, .62) than men after adjusting for age, Charlson index, and congestive heart failure. Crude CVD mortality for women was higher than men (HR, 1.7). After adjustments for age, Charlson index, and congestive heart failure, the HR was reduced to 1.19 for women. Further adjustment for CA and RV lowered CVD mortality in women slightly (HR, 1.14). RV is associated with lowered CVD (HR, .41).In patients with high indication for CA, use of CA and RV was significantly lower in women. After adjustments were made for risk profile and treatment modalities, women did not have a significantly increased risk for CVD compared with men. However, the apparent protective effect of RV in patients with a high indication for CA suggests that practices in line with ACC/AHA guidelines may reduce CVD in both women and men."mycardial	Outcomes	"To assess the difference between men and women as regards fatality shortly after acute myocardial infarction, and the relationship of patient characteristics.One thousand seven hundred and ten male and 563 female patients, 25-69 years of age and hospitalized with a first acute myocardial infarction occurring from 1985 to 1990, were included in the population-based World Health Organization MONICA-Bremen Acute Myocardial Infarction Register. Patient information, including short-term survival status, was obtained from the medical records of the seven Bremen hospitals with internal medicine departments and municipal death certificate files. The unadjusted 28-day fatality rate after acute myocardial infarction was higher among women than among men (23.1% vs 16.1% respectively: P < 0.001). Adjusting for the older age of women did not eliminate the difference completely (females; 20.9%, males: 16.8%; P = 0.041). Controlling for previous use of inotropic medicine and diuretics, during-the-event receipt of thrombolysis and platelet inhibitors, and age in logistic regression analyses resulted in a similar 28-day mortality risk after acute myocardial infarction for both sexes (female/male odds ratio = 1.13, 95% confidence interval = 0.86 1.50; P = 0.389).Sex was not an independent predictor of early acute myocardial infarction fatality. Our data suggest that the excess mortality risk in women can be explained by sex differences in age, pre-infarction cardiac impairment, and treatment during the coronary event."mycardial	Outcomes	"Our objective was to assess gender differences in mortality 1 year after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO-I) trial database of 41,021 patients with suspected acute MI was used to generate 1-year Kaplan-Meier survival plots. Risk quartiles and mortality of women and men were compared. The unadjusted 1-year mortality rate for the initial GUSTO-I population and 30-day survivors demonstrates a large gender gap [odds ratio for all patients = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.0-2.3, p < 0.001]. For the initial population, when adjusted for age, the gender gap is still apparent (odds ratio = 1.4, 95%, CI = 1.3-1.5, p < 0.001) although no longer significant when adjusted using the 30-day survival model (odds ratio = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.97-1.15, p < 0.001). For the 30-day survivors, adjustment based on age alone explained the 1-year mortality difference (risk ratio = 0.96, 95% CI 0.85-1.07, p = 0.441). When the population was divided into expected risk quartiles, women were more likely to fall into the higher expected risk quartiles, even after adjusting for age. A gender gap after acute MI is apparent, nearly all of which occurs within the first 30 days. A substantial portion of the gender gap is explained by the increased age of women, and the rest of the gap may be attributed to differences in variables predictive of 30-day mortality. During 1-year follow-up, the late mortality of women is no greater than that of age-matched men."mycardial	Outcomes	"This study sought to determine gender differences in hospital mortality in patients with acute cardiac ischemia.It is unclear why women experience higher mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than men and whether this applies to all patients with acute ischemia.We analyzed data from a prospective multicenter study involving patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms suggestive of acute ischemia.Of 10,783 patients, 5,221 (48.4%) were women. Mean age was 60.5 years for women and 56.9 for men (p < 0.001). Women had more hypertension (54.6% vs. 45.9%, p < 0.001) and diabetes (23.3% vs. 17.0%, p < 0.001) than men but fewer previous AMIs (21.1% vs. 28.9%, p < 0.001). Acute ischemia was confirmed in 1,090 women (20.8%) and 1,451 men (26.1%, p < 0.001), including AMI in 322 women (6.2%) and 572 men (10.3%, p < 0.001). Women with an AMI were in a higher Killip class than men: class I in 60.3% versus 72.2%, class II in 19.3% versus 16%, class III in 15.5% versus 8.7% and class IV in 5% versus 3.1%, respectively (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in mortality from acute ischemia between genders (4.0% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.6), but there was a trend for higher AMI mortality in women (10.3% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.1). After controlling for age, diabetes, heart failure and presenting blood pressure, gender did not predict mortality from acute ischemia (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.4, p = 0.5).Among patients presenting to the ED with acute cardiac ischemia, gender does not appear to be an independent predictor of hospital mortality. The trend for higher mortality in women from AMI can be explained by their older age, greater frequency of diabetes and higher Killip class on presentation."mycardial	Outcomes	"Women sustaining myocardial infarction fare worse than men during hospitalization. Reports on long-term survival in women surviving an acute myocardial infarction are controversial. The Secondary Prevention Reinfarction Israeli Nifedipine Trial (SPRINT) registry includes 5,839 consecutive myocardial infarction patients who were hospitalized in 13 coronary care units in Israel between 1981 and 1983. The authors examined sex differences in the long-term survival of 4,808 hospital survivors (1,120 women and 3,688 men). Women exhibited a significantly poorer long-term survival than men. After age adjustment, differences between men and women decreased, leaving a survival probability difference of 11% at the end of 12 years of follow-up. In a subgroup analysis, women exhibited poorer survival than men in a comparison of patients with and without periinfarction congestive heart failure or a history of myocardial infarction preceding the index infarction. The multivariate adjusted hazard ratios associated with female sex in diabetic and nondiabetic patients were 1.46 and 1.13, respectively. In conclusion, a cumulative survival disadvantage for women in comparison with men is still evident after 12 years of follow-up. The mortality difference is diminished but not erased after age adjustment or multivariate adjustment for confounders. The authors' results are compatible with a hypothesis that the main factor underlying the increased long-term mortality in women after myocardial infarction, besides older age, is diabetes mellitus."mycardial	Outcomes	"Women and men enrolled in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) IIIB trial of unstable angina and non-Q wave myocardial infarction (MI) were evaluated to determine gender differences in characteristics and outcome.Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death for women and men. However, the characteristics and outcome of women compared with men with unstable angina and non-Q wave MI have not been extensively studied.The characteristics, outcomes and proportion of 497 women and 976 men with unstable angina and non-Q wave MI at the time of enrollment were compared. When these proportions were noted to be significantly different, we compared them with the 7,731-patient TIMI IIIB Registry, which represents the non-trial, screened population with these syndromes at these centers.For both coronary syndromes, women were older, were less frequently white, had a higher incidence of diabetes and hypertension and were receiving more cardiac medications. The 42-day rate of death and MI in TIMI IIIB was similar for women and men (7.4% vs. 7.5%). Coronary angiography revealed less severe coronary artery disease for women than for men, with absence of critical obstructions in 25% versus 16% and mean ejection fractions 62 +/- 12% versus 57 +/- 13% for women versus men (p < 0.01). Medical management failed in women as often as in men, and rates of cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery were similar for women and men in the conservative strategy arm as well as in the invasive strategy arm. Women in the TIMI IIIB trial had proportionately more unstable angina than did men. The proportion of unstable angina and non-Q wave MI for women was similar in the trial and Registry. However, proportionately more men in the trial had non-Q wave MI than men in the Registry.1) Women with each acute coronary syndrome are older than men and have more comorbidity. 2) The outcome with unstable angina and non-Q wave MI is related to severity of illness and not gender. 3) Mortality associated with revascularization for unstable angina and non-Q wave MI was similar for women and men. 4) The proportion of women and men enrolled with each acute coronary syndrome is different. These rates reflect both the prevalence of disease and selection bias owing to trial eligibility criteria and other identified factors."mycardial	Management	"We analyzed potential gender differences in the use and prognostic value of stress technetium 99m sestamibi tomography, image results, and cardiac event rates over a period of 15 +/- 8 months in 1226 men and 1151 women. Men had more abnormal tomographic images, but referral for catheterization and revascularization similarly increased in relation to the number of defects. Men and women with abnormal images had similar event rates, 19.6% and 18.2%, respectively, although men more often had myocardial infarction or cardiac death (7.6% vs 4.1 %, p < 0.05), whereas women had an increased likelihood of unstable angina or congestive heart failure (11.5% vs 7.6%, p < 0.05). Normal images predicted a low yearly rate of myocardial infarction or death: 1.7% for men and 0.8% for women. Image findings, particularly defect extent, were independent predictors of events in both groups. Thus, after stress Tc-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion imaging, there was no gender bias in referral for invasive procedures, and for both men and women image findings were strongly associated with prognostic outcome."mycardial	Epidemiology	"In Germany, research is sparse on the associations between occupation and cardiovascular risk factors and disease or whether such associations differ for men and women.We analyzed the data from 12,093 males and 12,125 females aged 40-69 years, who participated in three regional and national health surveys that were conducted in western Germany between 1984-1991 as part of the German Cardiovascular Prevention Study. Hypertension, total and HDL cholesterol levels, and obesity were based on standardized measurements, whereas smoking, diabetes, and history of myocardial infarction, stroke, and angina pectoris were based on self-report, using standardized questionnaires. Occupations were categorized into 13 (males) or 12 (females) groups as proposed by Blossfeld, as well as according to the 30 most frequent specific occupations. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to adjust for age, cardiovascular risk factors, and socio-economic status (SES).Among males, after adjusting for age, cardiovascular risk factors and SES, all 12 occupational groups had significantly elevated odds rations for the prevalence of cardiovascular disease when compared with the reference category of professionals. Among females, no significant increase in cardiovascular disease was found in any of the 11 main occupational groups. Teachers were used as the reference category for the 30 most frequent occupations. In males, five occupations (carpenter, locksmith, warehouse clerk, doorman, and driver) yielded significantly elevated age-adjusted odds ratios for the prevalence of self-reported cardiovascular disease. In females, we found significant associations with cardiovascular disease only for two occupations (kindergarten-teacher and cook).The findings suggest that certain aspects of the workplace and its culture, particularly in blue-collar occupations, influence the cardiovascular risk in men to a greater extent than in women."mycardial	Management	"According to some studies, women with heart disease receive fewer procedures and have higher in-hospital death rates than men. These studies vary by data source (hospital discharge abstract versus detailed clinical information) and severity measurement methods. The authors examined whether evaluations of gender differences for acute myocardial infarction patients vary by data source and severity measure.The authors considered 10 severity measures: four using clinical medical record data and six using discharge abstracts (diagnosis and procedure codes). The authors studied all 14,083 patients admitted in 1991 for acute myocardial infarction to 100 hospitals nationwide, examining in-hospital death and use of coronary angiography, coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for death and procedure use for women compared with men, controlling for age and each of the severity scores.After adjusting only for age, women were significantly more likely than men to die and less likely to receive CABG and coronary angiography. Severity measures provided different assessments of whether women were sicker than men; for all cases, clinical data-based MedisGroups rated women's severity compared with men's, whereas four code-based severity measures viewed women as sicker. After adjusting for severity and age, women were significantly more likely than men to die in-hospital and less likely to receive coronary angiography and CABG; women and men had relatively equal adjusted odds ratios of receiving PTCA. Odds ratios reflecting gender differences in procedure use and death rates were similar across severity measures.Comparisons of severity-adjusted in-hospital death rates and invasive procedure use between men and women yielded similar findings regardless of data source and severity measure."mycardial	Outcomes	"In Germany in 1994, 86,915 people died from acute myocardial infarction; 56.3% of these cases were male. The corresponding mortality rates per 100,000 were 116.1 in men and 87.9 in women. The male-female mortality ratio in 1994 was most pronounced for males aged 45-54 years with a relative risk of 5.7 (95% CI, 5.2 to 6.2). The mean age of death was 70.5 years in men and 78.6 years in women, reflecting a difference of 8.1 years. In both genders, mortality rates of acute myocardial infarction in the former Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) started to decline in 1980. This decline summed up to -37.8% (95% CI, -38.9 to -36.8) in men and -25.7% (95% CI, -27.1 to -24.3) in women until 1994. The difference in gender-specific decline was significant. The steepest decline was achieved for men in the 25-44 year age group and for middle-aged women of 45-64 years. An increase could be observed for both genders over 85 years. The mean age of death from myocardial infarction, however, increased in the same time period by 2 years in men and 4 years in women."mycardial	Management	"This report describes the effect of age and gender on the results of balloon angioplasty using current technique and indications. A consecutive group of 2,067 patients who underwent angioplasty at a single institution after 1990 is described. Angioplastic success was 92.2% and similar among men and women and the various age groups. Sixteen patients (0.8%) died, and mortality among women was significantly higher (1.4 vs. 0.6%, p < 0.001). There were no age or gender differences in the rate of Q-wave myocardial infarction and the need for coronary artery bypass. Minor complications such as groin complications (10.5% women, 5.0% men; p < 0.001) and infections (6.4% women, 3.7% men; p < 0.05) were more common in women, and as a result the duration of hospitalization after angioplasty was longer. The length of hospitalization after angioplasty was longer with advanced age, mainly as a result of higher groin complications (p < 0.001), infections (p < 0.01) and renal failure (p < 0.05). We conclude that using current indications and technique, angioplasty can be performed safely with a high success rate. Mortality is higher among women. The length of hospitalization after angioplasty is longer in women and, at advanced age, due to higher rate of minor complications."mycardial	Management	"A longitudinal study was conducted to investigate gender differences in adaptation and activity among survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and their spouses during the six months post-hospital discharge. Male and female married survivors of MI, matched on age, disease severity, and socioeconomic status, and their spouses responded to measures about functional impairment, psychological distress, and level of involvement in household and other activities prior to and 4, 10, 16, and 22 weeks after the MI. Both patients and spouses were distressed by the MI, but the distress lasted longer for spouses. Male spouses increased traditional domestic activities (e.g. cooking, laundry) in the weeks shortly after their wives' heart attack, and patient wives decreased domestic activities compared to prior to the MI. However, wives still did as much as their husbands. Women recovering from MI may carry a heavier burden of household responsibilities and activities than their male counterparts. This burden, if premature, may pose a threat for reinfarction during the early stages of rehabilitation."mycardial	Outcomes	"To determine whether the reported higher case fatality in hospital after an acute cardiac event in women can be explained by sex differences in mortality before admission and in baseline risk factors.Analyses of data from a community based coronary heart disease register.Auckland region, New Zealand.5106 patients aged 25-64 years with an acute cardiac event leading to coronary death or definite myocardial infarction within 28 days of onset, occurring between 1986 and 1992.Case fatality before admission, 28 day case fatality for patients in hospital, and total case fatality after an acute cardiac event.Despite a more unfavourable risk profile women tended to have lower case fatality before admission than men (crude odds ratio 0.88; 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.02). Adjustment for age, living arrangements, smoking, medical history, and treatment increased the effect of sex (0.72; 0.60 to 0.86). After admission to hospital, women had a higher case fatality than men (1.76; 1.43 to 2.17), but after adjustment for confounders this was reduced to 1.18 (0.89 to 1.58). Total case fatality 28 days after an acute cardiac event showed no significant difference between men and women (0.85; 0.70 to 1.02)The higher case fatality after an acute cardiac event in women admitted to hospital is largely explained by differences in living status, history, and medical treatment and is balanced by a lower case fatality before admission."mycardial	Outcomes	"To determine sex differences in survival after myocardial infarction in older individuals.Prospective cohort study based on a community sample of older individuals. All patients were followed for 1 year after hospital admission.Two hospitals in New Haven, Connecticut.The study included 103 women and 120 men who were participants in the New Haven, CT cohort of the Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) program and who were diagnosed with myocardial infarction between the inception of the community study in 1982 and December 31, 1992. The mean age of women was 79.3 and of men, 77.3.Data on clinical characteristics were abstracted from medical records. Sociodemographic, psychosocial, and physical function information was derived from the EPESE interview preceding the infarction. The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality, for which three end points were used: early mortality (first 30 days), late mortality (1-year mortality among survivors of the first 30 days), and overall mortality (1-year mortality from admission in the whole sample).Mortality in the first 30 days did not differ significantly in the two sexes. The relative risk (RR) of death in women compared with men was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-1.47) before multivariable adjustment; this was unchanged after adjustment for demographic factors, comorbidity, functional status, psychosocial factors, and clinical severity (RR, 0.85, 95% CI, 0.41-1.76). Among survivors of 30 days, women were almost two times more likely to survive at 1 year compared with men, both before multivariable adjustment (RR, 0.56, 95% CI, 0.31-1.02) and after controlling for demographic factors, comorbidity, physical function, psychosocial factors, clinical severity on admission, and hospital complications (RR, 0.44 ; 95% CI, 0.20-0.99). Analyses involving 1-year follow-up from admission for the entire sample yielded intermediate results.There was little difference in mortality in the first 30 days after myocardial infarction between older men and women, but when the early deaths were excluded, women showed an increased survival compared with men in the first year after the myocardial infarction."mycardial	Outcomes	"Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs have been shown to promote numerous health benefits among patients with active coronary heart disease (CHD), but little is known about the percentage of eligible CHD patients who enroll in CR.A survey was performed of 500 randomly chosen CR programs in operation in the United States during 1990. Patient characteristics and enrollment data were combined with data from the 1990 National Hospital Discharge Survey to estimate the percentage of eligible patients who participated in early outpatient (Phase II) CR programs after myocardial infarction (MI), after coronary angioplasty (PTCA), or after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS).Completed surveys were returned by 163 programs (32.6%) with information on 1,322 women and 1,418 men who enrolled in their programs in 1990. Women were older, more likely to be single, and had more traditional CHD risk factors than men. Only a minority of MI, PTCA, and CABS survivors enrolled in CR programs (10.8%, 10.3% and 23.4%, respectively). Enrollment was particularly low for post-MI and post-CABS women as compared with men: 6.9% versus 13.3% (P < .001), and 20.2% versus 24.6% (P < .001), respectively. Enrollment was generally lowest for nonwhites, those over age 65, and those living in the southern United States.Cardiac rehabilitation programs are used by a minority of eligible patients, particularly among women, nonwhites, and the elderly. To meet newly released national guidelines that recommend CR services for most patients recovering from MI, PTCA, or CABS, and to still contain costs, new methods need to be explored that can expand the delivery of CR services in clinical settings."mycardial	Management	"Reports about the use of cardiac procedures have produced conflicting results as to whether there is a sex bias in the use of thrombolytic therapy, cardiac catheterization, or revascularization procedures. The present study was undertaken with the hope of resolving some of these different findings by examining the use of these therapies in women and men who presented to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute cardiac ischemia.During 7 consecutive months in 1993, 10673 individuals > or = 30 years old who presented with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of acute cardiac ischemia were enrolled in the Acute Cardiac Ischemia Time-Insensitive Predictive Instrument Clinical Trial at 10 hospitals in the East and Midwest. This study included 2542 patients (24% of all patients) who had confirmed acute myocardial infarction or angina pectoris. There were significant sex differences with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics and the use of cardiac procedures. Among patients with acute myocardial infarction, the use of thrombolytic therapy, cardiac catheterization, and revascularization procedures was similar in women and men after multivariate adjustment. However, in the group with angina pectoris, women were considerably less likely to undergo these procedures, even after adjustment for significant baseline covariates.Women with angina pectoris were less likely to undergo cardiac catheterization or revascularization procedures, although unmeasured factors could in part explain the observed differences."mycardial	Management	"There is conclusive evidence from clinical trials that thrombolytic therapy reduces mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). But still only a minority of patients admitted with AMI receive a thrombolytic drug. We have looked at a sample of AMI patients from several centres to study which factors limit the widespread use of thrombolytic therapy.From eleven European countries, we drew a sample of 4035 patients who were discharged or died in hospital with a diagnosis of AMI between January, 1993, and June, 1994. From the medical records, we obtained the observed rate of thrombolytic use, and we defined the shortfall as the proportion of patients with no contraindication but who did not receive a thrombolytic.Thrombolytic treatment had been used in 13-52% (median 36%) of the patients. Among untreated patients, we identified three groups of similar size: those whose symptom onset was more than 12 h (or unknown) before presentation; those causing diagnostic difficulty at presentation and/or lacking ECG criteria for treatment; and those with no apparent reason for withholding thrombolytic treatment (ie, the shortfall, which was 20%). Logistic regression analysis in all patients without contraindications showed that older patients and women were less likely to receive thrombolytic treatment. The adjusted odds ratio for female sex was 0.69 (95% CI 0.53-0.89), and that for age 65-74, for instance (versus 0-44), was 0.55 (0.34-0.89). These factors of age and sex were independent, and we noted that older patients and women were under-represented in the clinical trials of thrombolytic therapy for AMI.We confirmed that only about one-third of patients admitted to European hospitals with AMI receive a thrombolytic drug. Allowing for delays to presentation and difficulty of early diagnosis, the maximum rate of thrombolysis is about 55%. The lower use of thrombolysis in the elderly may be due to their under-representation in the clinical trials; the sex difference is unexplained."mycardial	Outcomes	"Scottish MONICA used medical and medico-legal records and World Health Organization MONICA Project criteria to register coronary events in 25- to 64-year-old residents of the high-incidence area of north Glasgow from 1985 to 1991.Age-standardized data from 3991 episodes of nonfatal definite myocardial infarction and coronary deaths in men (mean age, 55.5 years) were compared with 1551 in women (57.0 years). Many results, such as the overall 28-day fatality rates of 49.8% in men and 48.5% in women, showed insignificant differences. However, 74.3% of deaths in men occurred out of hospital versus 67.8% in women (P = .0004). After admission to hospital, fatality rates in women were 14% higher (P = .07) and after admission to coronary care, 22% higher (P = .04). Women were more often widowed. Fewer had a history of previous myocardial infarction, but the prevalence of angina pectoris, of smoking, and of chest pain in the attack was the same as in men; more had shock, syncope, and breathlessness. More consulted a doctor before admission to hospital, which delayed their coming under care. More men had ECG Q-wave progression, and more women had smaller ECG changes. This, and marginally reduced chances of direct admission to coronary care, of thrombolysis, of aspirin, and of beta-blockers, did not explain women's excess hospital fatality.Acute coronary events appear to be recognized and treated fairly equally in men and women 25 to 64 years old in Glasgow, so differences are small but subtle. More men die suddenly out of hospital; the reason why more women die after arrival may be because the equivalent number of men have already died outside."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Depression has been shown to adversely affect the prognosis of patients with established coronary artery disease, but there is comparatively little evidence to document the role of depression in the initial development of coronary disease.Study participants were 409 men and 321 women who were residents of Glostrup, Denmark, born in 1914. Physical and psychological examinations in 1964 and 1974 established their baseline risk factor and disease status and their level of depressive symptomatology. Initial myocardial infarction (MI) was observed in 122 participants, and there were 290 deaths during follow-up, which ended in 1991. A 2-SD difference in depression score was associated with relative risks of 1.71 (P = .005) for MI and 1.59 (P < .001) for deaths from all causes. These findings were unchanged after we controlled for risk factors and signs of disease at baseline. There were no sex differences in effect sizes.High levels of depressive symptomatology are associated with increased risks of MI and mortality. The graded relationships between depression scores and risk, long-lasting nature of the effect, and stability of the depression measured across time suggest that this risk factor is best viewed as a continuous variable that represents a chronic psychological characteristic rather than a discrete and episodic psychiatric condition."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"This study sought to compare the circadian variations in transient ischemic activity, mean heart rate and ischemic threshold between women and men with coronary artery disease.There is a circadian variation in ischemic activity, onset of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary artery disease, but studies assessing ischemia have incorporated predominantly male subjects.Thirty-one women and 45 men underwent at least 48 h of ambulatory ST segment monitoring.There was a similar and significant circadian variation in ischemic activity in both women and men (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively), with a trough at night, a surge in the morning and a peak between 1 and 2 PM, corresponding to a similar circadian variation in mean hourly heart rate (p < 0.0001) that was not different between men and women (p = 0.28, power to detect a shift 99.9%). Mean heart rate at onset of ischemia (ischemic threshold) had similar variability in women and men (p = 0.96), and harmonic regression analysis confirmed a significant circadian variation (p < 0.0001), with a trough at night and a peak during activity hours. Heart rate increased significantly in the 5 min before ischemia throughout the 24 h (p < 0.0001), with no gender differences in the pattern of preonset to onset heart rate changes over time (p = 0.52); the smallest differences were recorded in the middle of the night. The majority of ischemic episodes (80%) had a heart rate increase > 5 beats/min in the 5 min before ischemia, but there were no gender differences.Women with coronary artery disease have a pattern of ischemic activity and underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms very similar to men. The importance of increase in myocardial oxygen demand in the genesis of ischemia in both men and women is reflected by similar magnitude of heart rate increases before ischemia. The lower ischemic threshold during the nocturnal hours, when blood pressure is also lower, is consistent with a circadian variation in underlying coronary vascular tone."mycardial	Management	"In spite of national interest in gender differences in the presentation and management of chronic disease, limited information is available about possible gender differences in the receipt of thrombolytic therapy after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). As part of an ongoing community-based study of AMI, we examined gender differences in the receipt of thrombolytic therapy among 2885 patients with confirmed AMI. The study sample consisted of 1680 males and 1205 females with validated AMI who were admitted to 16 hospitals in the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area in four study periods between 1986 and 1991. During the years under study, 24.4% of men and 14.4% of women received thrombolytic therapy. Increases over time in the use of thrombolytic therapy were seen in both men (13.9% in 1986; 31.6% in 1991) and women (3.2% in 1986; and 19.0% in 1991). After controlling for a variety of factors that might affect use of thrombolytic agents, younger age, absence of a history of either congestive heart failure or stroke, and experiencing a Q-wave AMI were associated with receipt of thrombolytic therapy in both men and women; having an anterior AMI also was associated with use of thrombolytic agents in men. Women without as compared with those with a history of angina pectoris were significantly more likely to receive thrombolytics. Men who had Medicare insurance were significantly less likely to receive thrombolytics than were men with other types of health insurance. When this analysis was restricted to patients who were seen in area-wide hospitals within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms suggestive of AMI, similar factors were associated with the receipt of thrombolytic agents in men and women. The results of this community-wide study suggest a marked increase over the 5-year study period in the use of thrombolytic therapy in both men and women, with a greater relative increase observed in women. A relatively similar profile of patients likely to receive thrombolytic therapy was seen in both men and women."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Few epidemiological studies have investigated the relative importance of major coronary risk factors in the two sexes within the same study population. In particular, it is not clear whether smoking carries a similar risk of coronary heart disease in men and women.The associations between smoking, serum lipids, blood pressure, and myocardial infarction were examined in a population-based prospective study of 11,843 men and women aged 35 to 52 years at entry. During 12 years, 495 cases of first myocardial infarction among men and 103 cases among women were identified. Myocardial infarction incidence was 4.6 times higher among men. The incidence was increased sixfold in women and threefold in men who smoked at least 20 cigarettes per day compared with never-smokers, and the rate in female heavy smokers exceeded that of never-smoking men. Multivariate analysis identified current smoking as a stronger risk factor in women (relative risk, 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 5.1) than in men (relative risk, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6 to 2.3). Among those under 45 years old at entry, the smoking-related sex difference was more pronounced (in women: relative risk, 7.1; 95% CI, 2.6 to 19.1) (in men: relative risk, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.6 to 3.2). Serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure were also highly significant predictors in both sexes.Smoking was a stronger risk factor for myocardial infarction in middle-aged women than in men. Relative risks associated with serum lipids and blood pressure were similar despite large sex differences in myocardial infarction incidence rates."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"We believe our data may speak to the issue of sexual dimorphism with respect to MI. Most studies have concentrated on men with this disease. In a recent study, Lindpaintner et al10 could find no relationship between the D/D genotype and AMI in subjects of the Physicians Health Study. However, this study consisted entirely of men. The D allele may provide an avenue to discern differences in the pathogenesis of MI in men and women."mycardial	Outcomes	"An outpatient-based scoring system was developed for at-risk patients with coronary artery disease based on data derived from the clinical history and noninvasive testing results for the prediction of an adverse event, the development of risk subsets, and the evaluation of the appropriateness of utilization patterns in an ambulatory care patient population.This was a hospital-based cohort study. From a population of 3,795 consecutively tested patients, 872 with suspected coronary artery disease were enrolled from a midwestern university tertiary medical center from 1988 to 1989.Multivariable Cox modeling was used to develop scoring weights with scores ranging from -1.6 to 8.5 points. Significant multivariable disease predictors of cardiac death or myocardial infarction were use of nitroglycerin or insulin, ST-T wave changes, female gender, left ventricular hypertrophy, and a reversible thallium 201 defect. Receiver operating characteristics curves by use of the hazard score were comparable by gender. A probability threshold of .30 for cardiac death or myocardial infarction yielded a cut point of acceptable sensitivity and specificity for prompting medical management decisions. Below this threshold, the rate of follow-up diagnostic testing was 16.9% for women and 57.8% for men (p=.00001). Above this threshold, the rate of follow-up diagnostic testing was 40.6% for women and 64.3% for men (p= .04).Use of cardiac diagnostic services and cardiac event-free survival varies by gender in patients screened by noninvasive testing. For men at low risk of cardiac death or myocardial infarction, a statistically greater use of follow-up diagnostic testing was reported, thus reflecting more aggressive treatment and overuse of services for men as compared with women."mycardial	Outcomes	"To compare psychosocial adjustment, functional class, and return to work in a matched sample of women and men experiencing a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Longitudinal survey.Subjects were identified from six hospitals in the Southern California area. Data were collected in the home setting 1 and 4 months after hospital discharge.Data on 32 women experiencing a first AMI were matched on neuroticism and cardiac dysfunction with 32 men from the same sample.The following instruments were administered 1 and 4 months after hospital discharge: Self-Perception Inventory (self-esteem); Profile of Mood States (emotional distress); General Health Perceptions Questionnaire (health perceptions); Interpersonal Dependency Inventory (dependency); and the UCLA Social Support Inventory (social support). The Eysenck Personality Inventory (neuroticism) was administered at 1 month. Cardiac dysfunction was measured with data available from the hospital record. Functional class was measured at 1 month with the Specific Activity Scale. Self-report of demographics and return to work were obtained 1 and 4 months, respectively.Women experienced improved perceptions of current health whereas their ratings of prior health decreased. Overall emotional distress, anxiety, and depression decreased significantly over time in women. Women reported wanting, receiving, and giving more support than men did at 1 month and receiving and giving more support than men did at 4 months, although stress in support relationships rose over time. In men anxiety, depression, and health concern all decreased significantly over time whereas their ratings of prior health rose. The match between social support wanted and received decreased over time in males as did their satisfaction with the support received. Men reported a higher functional class than women at 1 month, but return to work at 4 months did not differ.Both women and men experienced improved psychologic adjustment within 4 months after AMI, although the specific areas of improvement differed. Return to work was comparable in spite of differences in functional class. The women appeared to activate their social support system more effectively than the men after AMI. Further research is needed to determine whether differences in social support contribute to adjustment that is better than what normative data predict for women."mycardial	Outcomes	"A number of studies have indicated that women who have a myocardial infarction have higher mortality rates than men. The purpose of the present study was to review the literature on sex differences in mortality after myocardial infarction to determine whether female sex is independently associated with lower survival.Reports were identified mainly through a MEDLINE search of the English-language literature from January 1966 through June 1994. Studies included were those comparing mortality after myocardial infarction between men and women, controlling at least for age and with more than 30 outcome events. After duplicate patient series were eliminated, 27 reports were included in our review. Crude rates were higher in women than in men during the early phase (in-hospital or first month), but control for age alone or in combination with other factors reduced sex differences in almost all studies. Unadjusted mortality rates among the survivors of the early phase were similar for men and women in most studies, and control for age and other factors resulted in an increased survival rate in women compared with men in several investigations, particularly those with a follow-up of > 1 year.Much of the increased early mortality after myocardial infarction in women is explained by the older age and more unfavorable risk characteristics of the women. In the long run, when differences in age and other risk factors are controlled for, women tend to have an improved survival compared with men."mycardial	Outcomes	"Women who undergo coronary angioplasty have a higher in-hospital mortality than men, although much of this difference can be accounted for by their poorer clinical characteristics at the time of their procedures. However, whether or not there are important long-term differences in outcome between women and men after coronary angioplasty is not clear.A retrospective analysis was performed of 3027 consecutive patients (824 women and 2203 men) who underwent successful angioplasty and who have been followed continuously for a mean of 5.5 years (range, 0.5 to 14 years). Follow-up is 100% complete. Event-free survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and clinical end points were also examined by Cox proportional-hazards models to account for important baseline differences when appropriate. There was a trend toward lower survival among women during follow-up, but this was not significant (P = .06). The relative risk of death among women compared with men after adjustment for baseline differences was 0.94 (CI, 0.76 to 1.15; P = NS). No significant sex differences in occurrence of Q-wave myocardial infarction were observed. Women were less likely to remain free of angina after 10 years (34% versus 37%, respectively; P = .008), but after adjustment for baseline differences, this difference was not significant (relative risk of angina, 1.07; CI, 0.95 to 1.21). Women tended to have less coronary artery bypass surgery performed during follow-up (P = .06); adjusting for baseline differences made this difference more significant (relative risk, 0.79; CI, 0.64 to 0.96; P = .02). Among patients who were not treated in the setting of acute infarction, no sex differences in survival and freedom from myocardial infarction were noted.After successful coronary angioplasty, the long-term prognosis for women is excellent and is similar to that observed in men. Risk-adjusted survival did not differ significantly between the sexes, but less frequent use of subsequent surgical revascularization was observed in women."mycardial	Management	"Although numerous studies indicate that women have a higher early mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than men, reasons for the difference are largely unexplained. We studied the role of sex in the prognosis of 1,600 patients with AMI aged 30 to 74 years in the population-based Minnesota Heart Survey. A 50% random sample was taken of all AMI patients hospitalized in 1980 and 1985 in the Twin Cities of Minnesota (Minneapolis-St. Paul) (1,168 men, 432 women). A multiple logistic regression model was used for predicting early death (within 28 days) and included baseline characteristics: sex, age, chest pain on admission, history of previous AMI, angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass surgery or hypertension, presence of heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias requiring direct-current shock, diabetes mellitus, valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, and levels of serum enzymes and blood urea nitrogen. Age-adjusted early mortality rate was significantly higher in women than men, but only in those aged < 65 years (12.5% of women vs 6.5% of men, p < 0.01) versus those aged > or = 65 years (19.5% vs 21.6%, p > 0.05). Multivariate analysis also showed that among those < 65 years, female sex was a strong and independent predictor of early death (odds ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.5, p < 0.01). Rates of coronary angiography, coronary artery bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and thrombolysis performed during hospital stay were higher in men, but after adjustment for age, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus, a statistically significant difference persisted only in the frequency of coronary angiography (26% in men vs 17% in women, p < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"mycardial	Outcomes	"To examine gender differences in the long-term prognosis of patients with myocardial infarction, 1000 patients with myocardial infarction were studied after coronary arteriography. Over a follow-up period of 3.3 +/- 2.0 years, 65 patients died from cardiac causes and 301 experienced cardiac events (death, reinfarction and revascularization). Overall, the 5-year cardiac mortality was 8%: that in females (12.4%) was significantly higher than that in males (6.6%) (p = 0.0073). The overall 5-year cardiac event-rate was 35%, with no significant difference between females and males (41.1% vs 33.3%). Univariate analysis revealed that differences in age (57.8 +/- 9.8 years in males vs 64.8 +/- 8.9 years in females, p < 0.0001), presence of smoking habit, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, heart failure, right coronary artery disease, nicorandil administration, hypolipidemic, diuretic and anti-hypertensive treatment, and warfarin administration were present between men and women. The mortality rate in elderly females tended to be higher than that in their male counterparts. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that number of diseased vessels, post-infarction angina and left main trunk disease were significant predictors for cardiac death in both sexes, while gender was not. Therefore, gender did not appear to affect the long-term prognosis after age-adjustment among patients with myocardial infarction in the Western part of Japan."mycardial	Management	"Little information is available regarding the occurrence of perioperative and late cardiac events in women with vascular disease. The current study was performed to examine whether sex-specific differences exist in these outcomes in a large population of vascular surgery patients and to determine the value of clinical and dipyridamole thallium variables in predicting myocardial infarction and cardiac death.Preoperative dipyridamole thallium imaging was performed in 567 vascular surgery patients, including 380 men and 187 women. The incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiac death was noted during the perioperative period and during a follow-up period of 50 +/- 5 months. Fixed and reversible thallium perfusion abnormalities were more common in men than in women (P < .001 and P = .004, respectively). Perioperative cardiac event rates were similar in men and women, 8.4% and 7.5%, respectively (P = .07). A transient thallium defect was associated with an increased risk of cardiac events by 3.9-fold in men (CI, 1.5 to 10.2) and 5.5-fold in women (CI, 1.4 to 22). Various clinical factors also were predictive of events but demonstrated substantial sex differences. For example, dipyridamole-induced ST-segment depression was strongly associated with perioperative events in men but not in women. There were 22 nonfatal myocardial infarctions and 29 cardiac deaths in men during the follow-up period, with comparable event rates noted for women. Cardiac event-free survival rates also were similar for men and women (P = .40). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a history of heart failure was an important prognostic variable for both sexes, as was a fixed thallium defect. Significant sex differences in the predictive value of other clinical factors for late cardiac events was apparent.The present study demonstrates that (1) thallium perfusion defects are more common in men; (2) transient thallium defects are associated with perioperative myocardial infarction and cardiac death in both sexes; (3) long-term survival rates after vascular surgery are similar between men and women; (4) a fixed perfusion defect is predictive of late cardiac events in women, with a trend noted in men; and (5) sex-specific differences were noted with regard to the prognostic value of various clinical risk factors. Therefore, dipyridamole thallium plays a significant role in the assessment of perioperative and long-term prognosis for both male and female vascular surgery patients. On the basis of these observations, modifications in risk stratification based on sex may be appropriate for men and women with vascular disease."mycardial	Management	"Lower rates of invasive cardiac procedures have been reported for blacks and women than for white men. However, few studies have adjusted for differences in the type of hospital of admission, insurance status, and disease severity. SETTING, DESIGN, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey were used to investigate race and sex differences in rates of cardiac catheterization, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass surgery among 10,348 persons hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction.White men consistently had the highest procedure rates, followed by white women, black men, and black women. After matching for the hospital of admission and adjusting for age, in-hospital mortality, health insurance, and hospital transfer rates (with white men as the referent), the odds ratios for cardiac catheterization were 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.87) for black men, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.83) for white women, and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68) for black women. Similar race-sex differences were noted for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery.Race and sex differentials in the rates of invasive cardiac procedures remained despite matching for the hospital of admission and controlling for other factors that influence procedure rates, suggesting that the race and sex of the patient influence the use of these procedures."mycardial	Management	"Previous studies have reported conflicting results on gender differences in the management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and have not evaluated hospital length of stay or costs. To determine gender-based differences in presentation, management, length of stay, costs, and prognosis after AMI, we studied 561 patients with AMI. Women were older, had systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a non-Q-wave AMI more frequently, whereas more men smoked cigarettes. Predictors of coronary angiography were: male gender (RR 1.9; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.1), chest pain at presentation (RR 1.8; 95% CI 1.0 to 3.3), recurrent angina (RR 4.1; 95% CI 2.5 to 6.8), admission via the emergency room (RR 0.2; 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3), and younger age. Gender did not predict mortality. Among presenting features, the predictors of length of stay were diabetes, prior coronary bypass and prior coronary angioplasty in men, and age alone in women. Pulmonary edema and need for coronary bypass during the hospital course were predictors of length of stay in men only. Among presenting features, predictors of cost were diabetes in men and congestive heart failure in women. Predictors of cost during hospitalization for men were pulmonary edema, coronary angiography, intraaortic balloon pump use, and coronary bypass; for women, they were peak levels of creatine kinase and coronary bypass. Thus, predictors of length of stay and hospitalization costs differ based on gender. Efforts at cost containment may need to be gender-specific."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Men have significantly more atherosclerotic disease than women. Platelet-mediated thrombosis plays a role in the initiation of myocardial infarction and stroke. Citrated whole blood from male and female donors was perfused through an annular system over everted human umbilical artery segments. Comparisons were made between platelet adherence and thrombus formation on subendothelium, platelet aggregation in citrated whole blood, hematologic variables, and the bleeding time. Platelet spreading and adherence were approximately 22% greater with male blood (P < 0.001), whereas thrombus formation on subendothelium and collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation did not show sex-related differences. Platelet aggregation with adenosine diphosphate was greater in women, related to their lower hematocrit values. By contrast, in women hematocrit values showed a slight but significant positive correlation with platelet adherence on subendothelium. Fibrinogen was significantly correlated with collagen- and adenosine-diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and with platelet adherence, spreading, and thrombus formation on subendothelium. The mean bleeding time was slightly longer in women than in men (P = 0.118). Platelet aggregation was not associated with the bleeding time except for collagen-induced platelet aggregation in males; the latter was significantly correlated with platelet adherence and spreading in both sexes, while arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation predicted platelet adherence and spreading in males. Male blood shows enhanced primary hemostatic activity; this may predispose men to atherosclerosis."mycardial	Review	"The leading cause of death in the United States is cardiovascular disease, regardless of gender. Women will more often have angina preceding their first myocardial infarct, but have more unrecognized infarctions than men. Women will be older, have more concomitant disease and present later in the course of their acute myocardial infarction. Although myocardial infarction may have similar clinical presentations in men and women, there are some important differences such as an increased incidence of non Q-wave myocardial infarctions in women, and the higher rate of complication and immortality from a myocardial infarct. Women develop less collateral cardiac vessels, which may explain the increased rate of hemodynamic complications after a myocardial infarct. Both early and late survival rates are also affected by the advanced mean age of women when they do present with a myocardial infarct. There is less data regarding treatment modalities based upon gender differences but in general, it appears that women benefit from established treatment modalities in the acute setting and subsequent to the event. It has been determined that there are epidemiologic differences, but pathophysiologic and clinical factors specific to women in this setting have yet to be determined."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"It has been suggested that there may be gender differences in the outcome of myocardial infarction and therapies. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the basic science of gender difference in the setting of experimental myocadial infarction. Therefore, we performed a randomized study to determine whether there is a gender-related difference in infarct size as well as arrhythmias in an experimental model of myocardial infarction. Eleven male and 10 female adult rats were studied. All rats underwent 90 minutes of left main coronary occlusion and 4 hours of reperfusion. After 4 hours of reperfusion, the area at risk (AR) was delineated by dye injection and the area of necrosis (AN) was assessed by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The electrocardiogram was recorded for the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). The area at risk was similar between the two groups. Myocardial infarct size, expressed as a percentage of the area at risk, averaged 57.3 +/- 4.9% in male and 58.2 +/- 3.5% in female rats (p = NS). The incidences of VT and VF were similar between male and female rats during 90 minutes of ischemia. Thus, gender had no effect on the extent of myocardial injury in this model of ischemia/reperfusion. To the best of our knowledge this is the first prospective randomized experimental trial that has shown no effect of gender on myocardial infarct size."mycardial	Outcomes	"We wished to evaluate whether differences in the rate of invasive cardiac procedures between men and women with acute myocardial infarction are associated with different short- and long-term mortality.The database (Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System, MIDAS) included all discharges for the years 1986 and 1987 with the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in New Jersey, based on the New Jersey hospital discharge data system (MIDS/UB-82). Accuracy of the data was evaluated by auditing 726 randomly selected charts. The variables examined included age, sex, race, comorbidity (anemia, chronic liver disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, prior myocardial infarction), complications (left ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, conduction defects), insurance status, performance of cardiac catheterization, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and survival up to 3 years. Women were older, had longer hospital stay, and were more likely than men to have anemia, diabetes, hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, and Medicare or Medicaid insurance coverage. They were less likely than men to be admitted to a hospital equipped to perform invasive procedures or to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, prior myocardial infarction, or arrhythmias. After adjustment for these differences, women were less likely than men to have cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catheterization was associated with lower mortality. Women up to age 70 had higher 3-year death rates than men after adjustment for age, race, comorbidity, complications, and insurance type. This difference between men and women was somewhat diminished after the performance of cardiac catheterization and revascularization was taken into account. Unadjusted mortality was high in this study group.Women with acute myocardial infarction are less likely to have invasive cardiac procedures and have higher 3-year adjusted death rate up to age 70 than men."mycardial	Review	"Although women who sustain coronary events (myocardial infarction, coronary bypass graft surgery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) have less favorable outcomes than do their male counterparts, the optimal approach to the evaluation of women with chest pain has not yet been ascertained. There is substantial documentation of the lesser use of invasive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for women than for men, despite symptoms of comparable or greater severity among women. This report reviews the information available to guide the selection of noninvasive test procedures for women with chest pain syndromes, highlighting clinical variables, particularly the characteristics of the chest pain and the coronary risk profile. Because coronary arteriography appears to be a major determinant of access to myocardial revascularization procedures, the less aggressive diagnostic evaluation of women with chest pain in general, and of those with abnormal noninvasive test results in particular, remains of concern. The role of gender differences in diagnostic testing in determining the worse prognosis of clinically manifest coronary disease in women has yet to be delineated."mycardial	Management	"A national study was performed in early 1992 in the 25 operating coronary care units in Israel, which enabled the assessment of whether the therapeutic management of patients with acute myocardial infarction was affected by patient gender. During a 2-month period, 1,014 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were hospitalized. Thrombolytic therapy was given to 47% of men (362 of 769), and 43% of women (106 of 245) (p = NS). After adjustment for age, no gender differences in the administration of thrombolytic therapy were noted (odds ratio 0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.73-1.23). Coronary angiography was more frequently performed in men (22%) than in women (16%) (p < 0.05). However, no gender differences in the use of angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery performed during the index hospitalization were found (10% in men, and 8% in women). The main reasons for ineligibility for thrombolytic therapy were: late hospital arrival, absence of qualifying ST-T changes on admission electrocardiogram, and contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Hospital death was significantly lower in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy (37 of 456; 8%) than in those excluded from thrombolysis (70 of 540;13%) (p < 0.01). This difference was significant for men, but not for women. The 1-year postdischarge mortality was 4% in patients treated compared with 12% in those ineligible for thrombolysis (p < 0.01). This significant difference persisted among men and women."mycardial	Management	"To determine if differences in early and late outcome after angioplasty were related to gender or body surface area, 5,000 consecutive patients (1,274 women and 3,726 men) were studied. Baseline variables, procedural outcome, and long-term and event-free survival were assessed. Baseline variables included age, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, myocardial infarction, prior angioplasty or bypass surgery, familial coronary disease, Canadian heart classification, extent of angioplasty, left ventricular function, and body surface area. Overall and event-free survival (freedom from infarction, repeat angioplasty, bypass surgery and death) were assessed at follow-up. The results showed that, compared with men, women were older (p < 0.0001), had a higher prevalence of diabetes (p < 0.0001), familial coronary disease (p = 0.002), hypertension (p < 0.0001), prior infarction (p = 0.004), and more involvement of the anterior descending artery (p = 0.017). Whereas men had similar extents of angioplasty and worse left ventricular function (p = 0.012), women more often had unstable angina (p < 0.0001). The success rates were similar, yet women had a higher procedural mortality (1.1% women, 0.3% men, p = 0.001). When corrected for body surface area, however, women were at no greater risk than men. Follow-up was complete for 97.4% of patients (mean 4 +/- 2 years). Event-free survival was significantly better in women, even after correcting for body surface area. Men were at higher risk for late death and repeat angioplasty on follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"mycardial	Management	"The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are gender differences in the outcome of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty performed for postmyocardial infarction ischemia.Although women have a higher mortality rate after myocardial infarction than that of men, they are less frequently referred for coronary angioplasty (and coronary artery bypass graft surgery) than are men, possibly because of expectations of a worse procedural outcome.We analyzed the morbidity and mortality at coronary angioplasty and during a mean follow-up period of 34.4 months for women and 34.2 months for men in 505 consecutive patients (164 women and 341 men) with postmyocardial infarction ischemia between 1981 and 1989.Compared with men, women had similar procedural success rates (89.6% and 91.2%, respectively), need for coronary artery bypass surgery (3.7% and 2.6%) and mortality rates at coronary angioplasty (0.6% and 0.9%). During the follow-up period, there were no significant gender differences in the requirement for coronary artery bypass surgery (3.6% and 4%), repeat angioplasty (18.7% and 17.3%), reinfarction (5.8% and 6%) and death (3.6% and 3.7%) or the combined end points of all four events (26.6% and 26.6%). Women had significantly more recurrent angina than did men (54% vs. 42.5%, p < 0.01), even though the extent of coronary artery disease and frequency of incomplete revascularization were similar in men and women.The procedural outcome of coronary angioplasty for postmyocardial infarction ischemia is similar in women and men. Long-term follow-up is also similar except that women experience an increased incidence of recurrent angina, an outcome also reported after bypass surgery. Therefore, concerns over the safety of coronary angioplasty in women should not adversely influence decisions concerning referral of women for coronary angioplasty after myocardial infarction complicated by ischemia."mycardial	Management	"To compare the short-term and long-term outcomes of directional coronary atherectomy in women and men.We retrospectively analyzed 291 consecutive directional atherectomy procedures performed in 61 women and 230 men at the Mayo Clinic between October 1988 and November 1992.The baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics, including extent of coronary artery disease and left ventricular ejection fraction, were compared for the male and female patients, and the short-term and long-term complications associated with atherectomy were summarized on the basis of gender.At baseline, women were older than men (67 +/- 12 versus 61 +/- 11 years; P = 0.001), and more women than men had class III or IV angina (90% versus 64%; P < 0.001); slightly more women than men had rest pain (64% versus 52%). Overall clinical success (improvement in luminal diameter of 40% or more and no death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, or emergency coronary bypass operation) was achieved in 89% of women and 95% of men (P = 0.054). In-hospital mortality was similar in women and men (1.6% and 1.7%, respectively), but acute myocardial infarction occurred more frequently in women than in men (4.9% versus 0.4%; P = 0.03). Significant peripheral vascular complications occurred in 6.6% of women versus 0.9% of men (P = 0.02). During long-term follow-up (mean, 2.9 years), survival and freedom from recurrent angina were similar among women and men.Directional coronary atherectomy is associated with slightly lower success and a higher frequency of myocardial infarction among women than among men. The higher postprocedural rate of myocardial infarction among women may reflect their worse clinical status at time of initial assessment. Despite these observations, women and men seem to have comparable survival and freedom from recurrence of angina during extended follow-up."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) was examined in random (control) and nonrandom (case) families participating in the Cincinnati Myocardial Infarction and Hormone (CIMIH) family study. The case families were ascertained through white men who survived a myocardial infarction (MI) before the age of 56, whereas control families were recruited through advertisements and through an adolescent boy maturation study. Both familial correlations and genetic effects of DHEAS were investigated. First, maximum likelihood estimates of the sex-specific familial correlations (corrected for nonrandom ascertainment) suggested that there was significant heterogeneity between the two sampling types. This heterogeneity was isolated to the male sibling correlation, which was higher in the case than control families. Post hoc analyses suggested that the sibling group heterogeneity may be in part a function of age, since the control sample offspring were on average much younger than those in case families. No sex differences other than those for the siblings were noted in the familial correlations. Second, heritability was investigated in control families using a simple path model (TAU) that allowed for sex differences. The only significant model parameter was the sex-specific familiarity (combined polygenic and familial environmental effects), which was larger in females (74%) than in males (29%). In general, these analyses suggested that (1) DHEAS may play only a limited role in the increased risk for premature MI, and (2) the degree of heritable (familial) variation may be dependent on sex."mycardial	Management	"As part of a community-wide study examining temporal trends in the incidence and survival rates of acute myocardial infarction, we examined differences between the sexes in overall utilization rates and changes over time, therein, of various therapies used in the management of acute myocardial infarction.Nonconcurrent prospective study.Three thousand three hundred sixty-one men and 2119 women hospitalized with validated acute myocardial infarction in 16 hospitals in the Worcester, Mass, metropolitan area during 1975, 1978, 1981, 1984, 1986, 1988, and 1990.After controlling, by means of a logistic regression analysis, for a variety of patient-related factors that could affect physician prescribing patterns, women were significantly more likely to receive diuretics during hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, whereas men were significantly more likely to receive antiplatelet agents, lidocaine, and other antiarrhythmic agents. No statistically significant differences were seen between men and women with regard to the use of anticoagulants, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, nitrates, and thrombolytic agents. Marked increases over time (1975 through 1990) were seen in the use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, lidocaine, and nitrates in each of the sexes, while declines were seen in the use of digoxin and diuretics. Use of thrombolytic therapy increased between 1986 and 1990, whereas use of calcium channel blockers decreased over this period for both men and women.The results of this multihospital, population-based, observational study suggest that physician practice patterns in the pharmacologic treatment of men and women hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction are very similar."mycardial	Outcomes	"The purpose of the study was to examine overall differences and temporal trends therein between men and women regarding the incidence rates, in-hospital and long-term survival after initial acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and out-of-hospital deaths caused by coronary disease.This nonconcurrent prospective study was carried out in 16 teaching and community hospitals in Worcester, Mass., in six time periods between 1975 and 1988. A total of 3,148 patients hospitalized with validated initial AMI comprised the study sample. The age-adjusted incidence rates of initial AMI increased between 1975 and 1981 in the two sexes, with a marked decrease thereafter; these rates declined by 26% in men and by 22% in women between 1975 and 1988. The overall unadjusted in-hospital case-fatality rates after initial AMI were significantly higher in women (21.7%) than in men (12.7%). Age- and multivariable-adjusted in-hospital case-fatality rates, however, were not significantly different for men compared with women (multivariate-adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.70, 1.16). No clear trends in in-hospital case-fatality rates were observed in men or women over the periods under study. There were no significant sex differences in the age-adjusted long-term survival rates of discharged hospital survivors of AMI. The multivariate-adjusted risk of total mortality among discharged hospital survivors, however, was significantly increased in men (multivariate-adjusted OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.03, 1.39); neither of the sexes experienced an improvement over time in long-term prognosis. The incidence rates of out-of-hospital deaths caused by coronary disease declined by 60% in men and 69% in women between 1975 and 1988.The results of this multihospital, community-based study suggest declines in the incidence rates of AMI and out-of-hospital deaths caused by coronary disease in men and women over the period under study (1975-1988). No significant sex differences in in-hospital survival were observed, whereas a poorer long-term survival experience after hospital discharge was observed for men compared with women after controlling for potentially confounding prognostic factors."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"The relationship of Lp(a) with manifestations of coronary heart disease (CHD) has not been studied extensively in women. There is little information as to the association of the unique Lp(a) apolipoprotein moiety (apo(a)) with CHD in either men or women. We therefore assessed the association of the apo(a) polymorphism and of Lp(a) with first acute myocardial infarction (MI) in a population-based case-control study in Jewish residents of Jerusalem between the ages of 25 and 64. The patients consisted of 238 men and 47 women hospitalized for a first acute MI in the 4 hospitals of Jerusalem serving the population (70% response rate among all first MI patients). The control subjects comprised 318 men and 159 women sampled from the national population registry and who were free of CHD (75% response). Lp(a) and apo(a) were measured in plasma stored at -20 degrees C for 6-24 months. Among men, plasma Lp(a) concentrations were higher in cases than controls in both univariate and multivariate analyses. The elevated risk was limited to the upper fifth of the Lp(a) distribution (unadjusted odds ratio = 1.65, P < 0.01 vs. the lower four quintiles, multivariable odds ratio = 1.82, P < 0.01). Among women, Lp(a) was not elevated in acute MI patients. Apo(a) isoforms with a B, S1 or S2 band (associated with higher Lp(a) values and having lower molecular weights) were more prevalent in female MI cases than controls (unadjusted odds ratio = 2.5, P = 0.016). This association could not be attributed to the higher Lp(a) concentrations associated with these isoforms and was not seen in men. In conclusion, our study points to an association of the apo(a) isoforms with acute MI in women, not evident in this population sample in men. Previously described associations of elevated Lp(a) with acute MI were confirmed in men but not in women. While the role of chance and inadequate statistical power cannot be excluded, the suggestion of a sex difference in the strength of these associations deserves further investigation, as does the question of whether apo(a) phenotype contributes to risk independently of Lp(a) level."mycardial	Management	"This study compares the overall use, as well as temporal trends, of various diagnostic and revascularization procedures for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in men and women. The study sample comprised a total of 2,924 men and 1,838 women with validated AMI admitted to any of the 16 teaching and community hospitals in the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area during 1975, 1978, 1981, 1984, 1986 and 1988. During the period under study there was a significant increase in use of each of the examined procedures during hospitalization for AMI in both men and women. Increasing use of multiple procedures was also seen for each of the sexes. After controlling for a variety of demographic and clinical factors that might affect utilization rates, men were marginally more likely to undergo radionuclide ventriculography, and significantly more likely to undergo Holter monitoring, exercise treadmill testing, cardiac catheterization, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty than women. However, there were no gender differences in the use of coronary artery bypass grafting. On the other hand, men were significantly less likely to undergo echocardiography. The results of this multihospital, population-based study suggest sex differences in the use of several diagnostic and revascularization procedures during hospitalization for AMI. These differences may be attributed to physicians' practice patterns, although gender bias in the delivery of medical care cannot be excluded. Temporal trends in increased overall use of these procedures raise questions about cost-effectiveness that need to be further addressed."mycardial	Epidemiology	"Differences exist between men and women in prognosis after the onset of coronary heart disease (CHD).All Framingham Heart Study subjects with the onset of clinically apparent coronary disease from 1951 through 1986 were studied to compare prognosis in men and women according to CHD presentation. Coronary disease presentations included angina, coronary insufficiency (unstable angina), recognized myocardial infarction, unrecognized myocardial infarction, and coronary death. Less than 1% of subjects were lost to follow-up for overall mortality. Cox modeling was used to examine the sex differences in outcome for each coronary presentation. New nonfatal coronary disease developed in 750 men (mean age, 63 years) and 583 women (mean age, 67 years). After onset of angina, men were at greater risk than women for myocardial infarction (hazards ratio [HR], 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45 to 3.34) and coronary death (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.32 to 3.36) after adjustment for age and coronary disease risk factors. After a recognized myocardial infarction, there was a trend toward greater risk for overall mortality in women than men after adjustment for age and risk factors (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.08). In contrast, after an unrecognized myocardial infarction, men were at increased risk for death compared with women (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.28 to 3.15).Women fare at least as poorly as men after recognized myocardial infarction, whereas women have a more favorable outlook than men after the onset of angina or unrecognized myocardial infarction. The favorable outcome in women after angina and unrecognized myocardial infarction is due, in part, to greater misclassification of these coronary events in women than in men."mycardial	Epidemiology	"This study was conducted to determine the role of insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetes in the prognosis of patients after myocardial infarction and treatment with fibrinolytic agents.Several studies have shown that diabetic patients have a high mortality rate after acute myocardial infarction. However, the impact of diabetes on survival in patients treated with fibrinolytic agents is still undefined. It is also not known whether the type of diabetes or gender affects prognosis.We analyzed prevalence and prognostic significance of a history of diabetes in patients enrolled in the GISSI-2 study, all of whom received fibrinolytic agents. The incidence of deaths in the hospital and at 6 months after study entry was computed for patients without diabetes and for insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients; relative risks were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis.Information on diabetic status was available for 11,667 patients, 94.2% of those randomized in the GISSI-2 study. The prevalence of diabetes was higher in women than in men (8.75% vs. 1.85%, p < 0.01 for insulin-dependent and 23.7% vs. 13.8%, p < 0.01 for noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients). The type of fibrinolytic agent did not affect mortality rates; the increase in in-hospital mortality of diabetic patients was moderate and similar for men with insulin- and noninsulin-dependent diabetes (8.7% and 10.1%, respectively, vs. 5.8% in nondiabetic patients); in women, mortality was markedly higher for insulin-dependent and only slightly higher for noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients (24.0% and 15.8%, respectively, vs. 13.9% for nondiabetic patients). The adjusted relative risks were 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.9) for insulin-dependent diabetic women and 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.8) for noninsulin-dependent diabetic men. The mortality rate after discharge showed a similar gender difference, and in insulin-dependent diabetic women, prognosis was ominous even in the absence of left ventricular damage before discharge.A history of diabetes is associated with a worse prognosis after myocardial infarction, even in patients treated with fibrinolytic agents. Gender and type of diabetes appear to be critical in affecting survival. In men, both insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetes are associated with a moderately higher mortality rate; in women, insulin-dependent diabetes is, in itself, a strong risk factor for death after myocardial infarction."mycardial	Outcomes	"The goal of this study was to investigate whether female gender portends an adverse prognosis independent of the severity of the underlying disease after acute myocardial infarction treated by thrombolysis. A total of 348 women were compared with 1,271 men enrolled in the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) trials.The reasons for gender differences in the management and prognosis of acute coronary artery syndromes remain poorly defined. The extent to which gender itself explains observed differences in outcome and use of diagnostic procedures remains unclear because confounding factors have not been specified.Patients < 76 years of age presenting within 6 h of onset of ischemic symptoms with electrocardiographic ST segment elevation and without contraindications to thrombolysis, previous infarction in the same distribution or cardiogenic shock were prospectively enrolled in Phases 1 to 3, 5 and 7 of the TAMI trials. All patients received recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, urokinase or a combination of both agents. Protocol-mandated cardiac catheterization was performed during the hospital period. Rescue coronary angioplasty was carried out for reperfusion failure at angiography 90 min after initiation of thrombolytic therapy. Coronary artery bypass grafting or coronary angioplasty was performed for clinical indications.Women were older than men (61.0 +/- 9.7 vs. 55.8 +/- 10.1 years, mean +/- SD) and had a higher incidence of many risk factors for adverse outcome after myocardial infarction. There were no differences in baseline hemodynamic variables or time to thrombolytic treatment. Rates of acute and predischarge infarct-related artery patency and global and regional left ventricular function were similar in the two groups. Rates of in-hospital coronary angioplasty (52.6% and 54.1%) and bypass graft surgery (20.4% and 22.0%) were comparable in women and men, respectively. Women had higher unadjusted rates of mortality (9.2% vs. 5.4%, p = 0.014), reinfarction (6.4% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.005) and hemorrhagic stroke (2.0% vs. 0.55%, p = 0.017) than did men during the hospital period. When adjusted for clinical and angiographic variables, differences in mortality and hemorrhagic stroke did not reach statistical significance, and the risk of reinfarction was only marginally associated with gender.In selected patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy and cardiac catheterization for acute myocardial infarction, adjusted mortality rates and utilization of postlysis revascularization are similar in women and men. However, women may be at increased risk for reinfarction."mycardial	Management	"The objective of this study was to compare treatment and outcome of acute myocardial infarction in women and men.In this survey, patient hospital records were reviewed, and information about patient characteristics, treatments, and hospital events was entered in the Myocardial Infarction Triage and Intervention Registry. Between January 1988 and June 1990, a total of 4891 consecutive patients, including 1659 women, were hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction in 19 hospitals in the Seattle (Wash) metropolitan area. In-hospital thrombolytic therapy, coronary angiography, angioplasty, and bypass surgery were examined, as were in-hospital complications and death.Women were older and more often had histories previous hypertension and previous congestive heart failure. Thrombolytic therapy was used less often in women, although information about eligibility for treatment was not available to determine if this difference was due to treatment bias or differences in eligibility. Both coronary angiography and coronary angioplasty were used less frequently in women. However, of patients who had coronary angiography, equal proportions of women and men received angioplasty and/or coronary bypass surgery. Hospital mortality was 16% for women and 11% for men, although this difference was diminished by age adjustment. Mortality was higher in women undergoing bypass surgery, but this difference, too, was less apparent after age adjustment.Despite high levels of risk factors and mortality, coronary angiography and angioplasty were used less often in women, although among those who underwent coronary angiography, there were no gender differences in the use of angioplasty or bypass surgery. Clearly, more needs to be known about decision making for coronary angiography, as this process seems to differ for women and men with acute myocardial infarction."mycardial	Epidemiology	"The authors considered whether the difference in body fat distribution between men and women, measured as waist:hip ratio, might explain part of the sex difference in coronary heart disease incidence in prospective population studies of 1,462 women and 792 men. In these studies, conducted in Sweden, men were found to have about four times higher odds for coronary heart disease than women during a 12-year follow-up period (men, 1967 to 1979; women, 1968-1969 to 1980-1981). Controlling for differences in blood pressure, serum cholesterol, smoking, and body mass index only marginally altered the magnitude of the male-female difference. When waist:hip ratio, which predicted coronary heart disease rates in both sexes, was also considered, the sex difference in coronary heart disease risk was significantly reduced and virtually disappeared (odds ratios = 1.0-1.1; nonsignificant). The findings suggest that body fat distribution or a factor highly correlated with waist:hip ratio (genetic, hormonal, or behavioral) may help to explain the sex differences in coronary heart disease."mycardial	Outcomes	"Little is known about women's and older adults' experiences after myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine if gender and age differences exist in psychosocial condition, health state and therapeutic regimen adherence among MI survivors. Adults aged 40 to 88 years (n = 197) were interviewed 1 to 2 years after their first MI. The Profile of Mood States was used to measure anxiety and depression, the Personal Resources Questionnaire was used to measure social support, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale was used to measure self-esteem, the Perceived Quality of Life scale was used to measure quality of life, and the Health Behaviour Scale was used to assess therapeutic regimen adherence. Cardiac rehabilitation participation was recorded from rehabilitation centre records. Subjective health appraisals were assessed using investigator-developed questions. Increased age was associated with higher depression scores, lower quality of life, less social support, less participation in formal cardiac rehabilitation, less therapeutic exercise and poorer general health. Women reported poorer health than men. Findings indicated older males may be at risk for lower social support and continued smoking after infarction. These findings suggest that the often-reported experience of middle-aged males post-MI cannot be generalized to all adults experiencing infarction."mycardial	Clinical	"Race-gender differences in creatine kinase values were studied in 647 consecutive patients admitted for suspected myocardial infarction. The lowest value in a serial set for each patient was used for group comparisons. Significant differences were found between Hispanic females and black males, using standard values. Using log creatine kinase values, significant differences were found among blacks, Caucasians, and Hispanics. Males had higher log creatine kinase values than females, but no differences were found between sexes within racial groups. Body surface area differences (significant between males and females) did not explain all of the racial-gender differences found. Reexamination of ranges of normality, taking into account race-gender differences, is strongly supported by these data."mycardial	Review	"Both the presentation and prognosis of coronary heart disease in women are significantly different than in men. Diagnostic evaluations should be approached somewhat differently in male and female populations, and gender should be one of the variables assessed when options for medical and surgical therapy are considered. Risk factor modification can be offered as a potentially effective form of therapy for coronary heart disease in women. These modifications would include cessation of smoking, avoidance of oral contraceptives in women greater than 35 years of age, hypertension control, and normalization of blood lipid profile and body weight. Risk factor modification may be particularly important in prevention of accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetic women. Prognosis after myocardial infarction is significantly worse in women despite better post-infarction left ventricular ejection fraction and higher incidence of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in that population. Definitive assessment of coronary anatomy and aggressive management of coronary heart disease should be considered in women judged to be at high risk. Little information is available regarding gender-specific responses to medical management of coronary heart disease. Women seem to have a less favorable short-term outcome after PTCA, but better long-term results. Coronary artery bypass grafting results appear to depend less on gender than on coronary anatomy, preoperative risk factors, and patient size, and thus should not be withheld from women."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"As part of an epidemiologic cross-sectional study to determine cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in the population (total serum cholesterol, smoking, blood pressure, and body weight) hemoglobin (Hb) and plasma viscosity (PV) were measured. A two-stage cluster sample of 5,312 persons, aged twenty-five to sixty-four (available 5,069) was selected from a mixed urban-rural target population of 282,279 inhabitants, from which 4,022 (79.3%) participated in the study. Patients with chronic myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral infarction (CI), angina pectoris (AP), and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were identified by questionnaire. The results show that there is no age or sex dependency of PV in healthy participants, while hemoglobin shows the well-known sex difference. In contrast, PV increases continuously with age in the total population. In men, increased PV is found in untreated hypertension, in hypercholesterolemia, and in smokers. In women, it is raised in hypercholesterolemia and in gross obesity. Male MI patients and patients of both sexes after CI in particular show statistically significantly elevated PV. Finally, in male patients with chronic AP or patients of both sexes with PAD, PV is elevated and a tendency to higher Hb values is seen. These results confirm smaller clinical trials suggesting that blood fluidity is pathologically altered in patients with CV risk factors or diseases. Since impaired blood fluidity may worsen the hemodynamic situation, in particular in patients with limited vasomotor reserve, hemorheologic parameters may be of prognostic relevance. Therapeutic implications of these findings should be considered."mycardial	Outcomes	The cardioangiographic findings in 50 women 40-54 years of age were compared with those of a series of 69 men with infarction recruited from the same catchment area and investigated according to the same principles. Women less often had left ventricular abnormalities than men; this difference was mainly confined to patients with non-Q wave infarctions. There was no difference in the prevalence of left ventricular abnormalities among women and men with Q wave infarctions. No major sex difference was found in the prevalence of coronary abnormalities. Collaterals were less common in women than in men.mycardial	Epidemiology	"The prevalence of primary risk factors, previous medical history, and physical activity were assessed among 262 women and 1259 men who suffered a first nonfatal myocardial infarction between 1968 and 1977 in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden. The probability of suffering a myocardial infarction based on the conventional factors cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure and smoking habits was estimated in both sexes by means of a multiple risk function. Comparisons between sexes were made with age alone and age and estimated primary risk as confounders. Survival rate and reinfarction rate were calculated for a 5-year period of follow-up. Women with infarctions had higher serum cholesterol levels (p less than 0.001) and higher blood pressure values (p less than 0.001) but were less often smokers than men (p less than 0.001). The female patients also reported chest pain and dyspnea on exertion, and low physical activity both at work and during leisure time significantly more often than men; these differences remained after controlling for estimated primary risk. An overrepresentation of hypertension and diabetes prior to myocardial infarction was found among women below 45 years of age compared with men. A high frequency of women in this age group was also on sick leave or disability pension at onset of myocardial infarction, suggesting that mainly women with several risk factors including socioeconomic factors suffer an infarction at this age. No similar and consistent differences were found between women and men of older ages. The cumulative 5-year survival rate was 80% in women and 81% in men. Below age 45 the survival rate was lower among women than men (p less than 0.01). No sex difference was found in the recurrence rate of nonfatal reinfarctions. This indicates that once women have suffered a myocardial infarction they are exposed to at least as high a risk as men."mycardial	Pathophysiology	"A family study of serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and total serum cholesterol concentration has been undertaken, and the relation to age, sex, cigarette smoking, physical activity and familial occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI) was examined. HDL cholesterol was determined in 251 females and 194 males and total serum cholesterol in 677 females and 657 males, all aged 0-49 years. With respect to HDL cholesterol, significant sex differences were observed both in absolute level and in age-related change. A negative correlation between HDL cholesterol and total serum cholesterol was observed in all age groups except females aged 0-19 years, supporting the hypothesis of HDL as a """"clearing'' lipoprotein. HDL cholesterol showed a positive correlation only in pairs of first-degree relatives involving the mother and in sib-sib paris of the same sex. On the other hand, for serum cholesterol a positive correlation was found among all family members, although significantly higher between first-degree relatives than between spouses. No relation was found between cigarette smoking, physical activity of familial occurrence of MI and the HDL cholesterol or total serum cholesterol concentrations. In accordance with the """"HDL hypothesis'', the present finding could partly explain the higher incidence of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in males than in females, and partly also the high risk which is transmitted from women with IHD to their first-degree relatives."Heart	EPI	"We examined the association of sex with clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients following myocardial infarction (MI) in the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT).A total of 4570 women and 10â€‰133 men with heart failure (HF), left ventricular systolic dysfunction or both were enrolled 0.5-10â€‰days after myocardial infarction (MI) and followed for a median of 24.7â€‰months. Compared with men, women were older, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to present in Killip Class III/IV and experience post-infarction angina or HF. After adjusting for baseline differences, both short-term and longer-term mortality were similar in men and women. However, women were more likely than men to experience the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, MI, HF, stroke, and resuscitation from cardiac arrest [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI); 1.06-1.24, P=0.001], mainly owing to an increased risk of hospitalization for HF (adjusted HR 1.36; 95% CI 1.22-1.52; P<0.001). In a subset of patients who underwent echocardiographic study (n=603), women had smaller left ventricular volumes indexed by body size than men but similar ejection fractions and similar changes in ventricular volumes from baseline to 1â€‰month and 20â€‰months.In VALIANT, the risk of HF following MI was higher in women than men after adjusting for age and comorbidities, although the risk of other fatal and non-fatal outcomes were similar. The higher long-term risk of HF in women appears to be independent of the extent of left ventricular systolic dysfunction or remodelling compared with men."Heart	MANAG	"The purpose of this study was to evaluate gender differences regarding outcome after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (cfLVAD) implantation. The study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. Included were 24 consecutive female cfLVAD recipients and 24 male recipients (62.5% HeartMate II, 37.5% HeartWare) who received their devices between July 2007 and May 2013. Subjects were matched using propensity score analysis based on age, diagnosis, body surface area, preoperative mechanical circulatory support, heart failure severity score (INTERMACS class), and comorbidities. Female patients were significantly sicker before operation. After propensity score matching, there were no statistically significant differences in demographics or clinical baseline characteristics between male and female LVAD recipients. Also, there was a trend towards a longer postoperative intensive care unit stay in the female group (median 9 days [interquartile range 5-17] versus 15 days [interquartile range 8-33]; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.061) and higher postoperative bilirubin values (median 14â€‰mmol/L [interquartile range 10-17] versus 21â€‰mmol/L [interquartile range 13-30]). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of outcome (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.569). The overall survival was comparable between the two groups (log rank Pâ€‰<â€‰0.389). Half (50%) of female patients required inotropic support for more than 7 days compared with 21.7% in the male group (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.048). Half (50%) of female recipients required short-term postoperative right ventricular assist device implantation compared with 16.7% in the male group (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.014). In conclusion, cfLVAD implantation as a bridge to transplantation is associated with longer duration of inotropic support and higher requirement for postoperative mechanical right ventricular support in women with similar survival rates. Further studies are required to identify additional demographic and clinical factors that modulate outcomes and will enhance the ability to risk-stratify cfLVAD recipients. "Heart	MANAG	"International guidelines advocate an implantable cardioverter and defibrillator (ICD) in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to prevent sudden death (SCD). Previous data suggest that the benefit of ICD therapy in real life may be lower than expected from the results of controlled studies and side-effects are not negligible. It is also unclear whether women benefit from treatment to the same extent as men. The aim of this study was to investigate the balance between benefits and complications of ICD therapy in a real-life population of patients with heart failure.We studied 865 consecutive patients with reduced LVEF treated with ICDs for primary prevention of SCD in 2006-11 in four tertiary care hospitals in Sweden (age 64 Â± 11 years, 82% men, 62% ischaemic). The patients' medical records were scrutinized as regards appropriate therapies, complications related to the defibrillator, all-cause mortality, and gender differences. Mean follow-up was 35 Â± 18 months. During follow-up 155 patients (18%) received appropriate ICD therapy, 61 patients (7%) had inappropriate shocks, 110 patients (13%) had at least one complication that required reoperation and 213 patients (25%) died. Men were twice as likely to receive ICD treatment compared with women (20 vs. 9%, P < 0.01), but neither total mortality nor complication rates differed.Ventricular arrhythmias necessitating ICD therapy are common (6% annually). Women are less likely to have correct ICD treatment, but have the same degree of treatment complications, thus reducing the net benefit of their treatment."Heart	OUTC	"The purpose of this descriptive study was to investigate changes in quality of life (QoL), disease severity and exercise tolerance of heart failure (HF) patients in a medically underserved clinic based on race and gender. Despite advances in the treatment of HF over the past decade, incidence, morbidity and mortality for patients continue to rise while QoL declines. HF is common in African-Americans and women; however, there is limited research focusing on race and gender variables. Health related QoL, disease severity measured by B-type natriuretic peptide blood test (BNP) and ejection fraction (EF), and exercise tolerance measured by six minute walk test (6MWT) were assessed at admission and at 6 months in a convenience sample of 53 patients. Variables were compared by race and gender. The sample was 67.9% African American and 62.3% male. Men had greater improvements than women in QoL, BNP, and EF, while women had greater improvements in the 6MWT. African Americans had greater improvements than Whites in all four variables. Even in the presence of disease severity in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III and IV HF, there were significant improvements in QoL, BNP, HF outcomes demonstrating the importance of developing culturally sensitive and gender-specific treatment plans."Heart	REVIEW	"Heart failure (HF) poses a heavy burden on patients, their families and society. The syndrome of HF comes in two types: with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The latter is on the increase and predominantly present in women, especially the older ones. There is an urgent need for mortality-reducing drugs in HFpEF, a disease affecting around 5Â % of those aged 65Â years and over. HFpEF develops in patients with risk factors and comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, but also preeclampsia. These conditions are likely to drive microvascular disease with involvement of the coronary microvasculature, which may eventually evolve into HFpEF. Currently, the diagnosis of HFPEF relies mainly on echocardiography. There are no biomarkers that can help diagnose female microvascular disease or facilitate the diagnosis of (early stages of) HFpEF. Recently a Dutch consortium was initiated, Queen of Hearts, with support from the Netherlands Heart Foundation, with the aim to discover and validate biomarkers for diastolic dysfunction and HFpEF in women. These biomarkers come from innovative blood-derived sources such as extracellular vesicles and circulating cells. Within the Queen of Hearts consortium, we will pursue female biomarkers that have the potential for further evolution in assays with point of care capabilities. As a spin-off, the consortium will gain knowledge on gender-specific pathology of HFpEF, possibly opening up novel treatment options. "Heart	CLIN	"Sex differences in patients with established heart failure have been well described, but much less is known in the development of heart failure.We studied sex-specific incidence and risk of new-onset heart failure in 8592 subjects (mean age 49.2 Â± 12.7 years; 50.1 % women) of the Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENdstage Disease (PREVEND) study and distinguished reduced and preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF <40 % and HFpEF >50 %).Of 374 cases with incident heart failure, 241 (64.4 %) occurred in men and 133 (35.6 %) in women (median follow-up 12.5 years; 96,550 person-years). Men developed heart failure earlier (7.0 vs. 8.6 years; P < 0.001). Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years in women compared to men were lower for HFrEF (1.2 vs. 3.0 %; P < 0.001), but higher for HFpEF (1.2 vs. 0.7 %; P < 0.001). Women developed HFpEF later in life than HFrEF (75.1 vs. 69.7 years; P = 0.033), while men showed no significant difference (72.2 vs. 69.5 years; P = 0.116). Multivariable competing risks analyses showed that women had lower risk for HFrEF (subhazard ratio = 0.47; 95 % CI 0.29-0.76, P = 0.002) but higher risk for HFpEF (subhazard ratio = 2.16; 95 % CI 1.21-3.83, P = 0.009) than men. Among all risk factors, only atrial fibrillation had a sex-specific predictive value and increased risk specifically for women (P-for interaction = 0.016).In a middle-aged population, men developed heart failure more frequently and at a younger age than women. However, women had higher risk for HFpEF, with atrial fibrillation being a specific female risk factor."Heart	REVIEW	"Multiple studies of heart failure patients demonstrated significant improvement in exercise capacity, quality of life, cardiac left ventricular function, and survival from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), but the underenrollment of women in these studies is notable. Etiological and pathophysiological differences may result in different outcomes in response to this treatment by sex. The observed disproportionate representation of women suggests that many women with heart failure either do not meet current clinical criteria to receive CRT in trials or are not properly recruited and maintained in these studies.We performed a systematic literature review through May 2014 of clinical trials and registries of CRT use that stratified outcomes by sex or reported percent women included. One-hundred eighty-three studies contained sex-specific information.Ninety percent of the studies evaluated included â‰¤ 35% women. Fifty-six articles included effectiveness data that reported response with regard to specific outcome parameters. When compared with men, women exhibited more dramatic improvement in specific parameters. In the studies reporting hazard ratios for hospitalization or death, women generally had greater benefit from CRT.Our review confirms women are markedly underrepresented in CRT trials, and when a CRT device is implanted, women have a therapeutic response that is equivalent to or better than in men, while there is no difference in adverse events reported by sex."Heart	REVIEW	"Heart failure (HF) is increasing in incidence globally, and approximately half of all HF patients are women. When women and men with HF are compared, there are significant differences in disease etiology, expression, outcomes, and perhaps, response to therapy. Hypertension rather than coronary artery disease is a more important etiology of HF in women, and HF with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFPEF) is more common in women. Regardless of its etiology, women have better survival and less sudden cardiac death, but poorer quality of life with equivalent degrees of left ventricular dysfunction. Animal studies of myocardial response to stressors resulting in heart failure corroborate sex differences in ventricular remodeling, cellular morphology, and function. Despite the fact that women make up nearly 50 % of HF patients, their inclusion in randomized clinical trials has remained at about 20 %, with no trials including women as a prespecified subgroup for statistical analysis. Thus, the evidence base for treatment of HF in women is not robustly supported by sex-specific data."Heart	CLIN	"We performed a prospective multi-center study to assess gender-specific differences in the predictive value of the measured level of NT-proBNP and the calculated Heart Failure Survival Score (HFSS).Baseline characteristics and follow-up data up to 5 years from 2,019 men and 530 women diagnosed with chronic heart failure (CHF) due to ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy were prospectively compared. Death from any cause constituted the endpoint of the study. NT-proBNP was measured and HFSS calculated according to standard methods. Survival of men and women according to level of NT-proBNP and HFSS was analyzed in logistic regression models.Median NT-proBNP level in men was 1,394 ng/l (IQR 516-3,406 ng/l) and 1,168 ng/l (IQR 444-2,830 ng/l) in women (p = n.s.). Median HFSS value was 8.4 (IQR 7.7-9.1) and 8.5 (8.0-9.1) in men and women, respectively. NT-proBNP levels and HFSS score correlated well with survival rates in both genders (p for interaction = 0.22 for NT-proBNP and 0.93 for HFSS). The all-cause death rates were similar in men and women.Despite a number of gender-specific differences in CHF and the general predominance of men measured levels of NT-proBNP and HFSS score can be utilized for risk stratification with similar informative value in men and women."Heart	CLIN	"Chronic heart failure is a common disease with a high morbidity and mortality. In primary care, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is used for excluding heart failure. The Dutch and European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines apply two BNP cut-off levels without making distinction for gender and age. The aim of our study was to establish BNP reference ranges for use in primary care.We investigated BNP values of 9447 eligible subjects in a primary care laboratory. For establishing the reference ranges in various age and gender classes we used the Bhattacharya method.Analysis of variance demonstrated that BNP data were significantly dependent on age and gender (p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively), with the age effect being the strongest. Further, we found that the reference ranges were significantly higher than the cut-off values used in the heart failure guidelines, particularly in elderly subjects. For example, the proportion of individuals with a BNP value higher than the 29 pmol/L cut-off increased from approximately 5% in the youngest group to no less than about 50% in the oldest subjects.BNP reference ranges need to be age- and gender-specific. When applying a single cut-off, many healthy subjects, especially the elderly, would be falsely diagnosed as having elevated BNP, and referred for further unnecessary diagnostics."Heart	PP	"Women with aortic stenosis develop a more concentric form of LV hypertrophy than men. However, the molecular factors underlying sex differences in LV remodelling are incompletely understood. We took an unbiased approach to identify sex-specific patterns in gene expression and pathway regulation, and confirmed the most prominent findings in human hearts.Echocardiography was performed in 104 patients (53.8% women) with aortic stenosis before aortic valve replacement. LV mass, LV end-diastolic diameter, and relative wall thickness were included in a factor analysis to generate an index classifying LV remodelling as adaptive or maladaptive. Maladaptive remodelling was present in 64.6% of male and in 32.7% of female patients (P < 0.01). Genome-wide expression profiling of LV samples was performed in a representative subgroup of 19 patients (52.6% women) compared with samples from healthy controls (n = 18). Transcriptome characterization revealed that fibrosis-related genes/pathways were induced in male overloaded ventricles, while extracellular matrix-related and inflammatory genes/pathways were repressed in female overloaded ventricles (adjusted P < 0.05). We confirmed gene regulation by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting analysis, and we further demonstrate the relevance of our findings by histological documentation of higher fibrosis in men than in women.We conclude that in pressure overload distinct molecular processes are regulated between men and women. Maladaptive LV remodelling occurs more frequently in men and is associated with greater activation of profibrotic and inflammatory markers. Collectively, sex-specific regulation of these processes may contribute to sex differences in the progression to heart failure."Heart	MANAG	"Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) are recommended by guidelines for patients with heart failure (HF) meeting specific criteria. Uncertainty exists regarding estimates of device eligibility, related in part to the method of assessing for guideline nonadherence.The aim of this study was to identify the rates of guideline eligibility and device utilization after accounting for reasons for not receiving an ICD or CRT.Patients were identified from 2006 to 2011 in a tertiary Heart Function Clinic in Canada. The chart-level data were collected that would indicate guideline eligibility and nonadherence.A total of 762 patients with HF were included (mean age 66 years; 527 (69%) were males; median left ventricular ejection fraction 33%). Over follow-up, 331 patients (43%) were never guideline eligible whereas 431 (57%) were guideline eligible for a device. Yearly rates for ICD and CRT adherence in ""guideline-eligible"" patients ranged from 59% to 68% and from 66% to 81%, respectively. ""Patient preference"" was the most commonly documented reason for guideline nonadherence in eligible patients. After removal of patients with reasons for nonadherence, rates of ICD and CRT adherence in the ""truly eligible"" patients were found to be higher (70%-81% and 71%-88%, respectively) than those in guideline-eligible patients. Independent predictors of device nonadherence in truly eligible patients were age >75 years, QRS duration <120 ms, left ventricular ejection fraction <30%, and female sex.Based on chart-level data, utilization rates of device-based therapies in patients with HF appear much higher than those of prior registry-based estimates. Given the importance of patient preferences for lack of device use, future quality-of-care metrics based on guideline adherence should capture detailed chart-level data and patient preferences."Heart	EPI	"It is unknown whether sex differences in the association of diabetes with cardiovascular outcomes vary by race. We examined sex differences in the associations of diabetes with incident congestive heart failure (CHF) and coronary heart disease (CHD) between older black and white adults.We analyzed data from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling individuals aged â‰¥65 from four US counties. We included 4817 participants (476 black women, 279 black men, 2447 white women and 1625 white men). We estimated event rates and multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for incident CHF, CHD, and all-cause mortality by Cox regression and competing risk analyses.Over a median follow-up of 12.5years, diabetes was more strongly associated with CHF among black women (HR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.70-3.40]) than black men (1.39 [0.83-2.34]); this finding did not reach statistical significance (P for interaction=0.08). Female sex conferred a higher risk for a composite outcome of CHF and CHD among black participants (2.44 [1.82-3.26]) vs. (1.44 [0.97-2.12]), P for interaction=0.03). There were no significant sex differences in the HRs associated with diabetes for CHF among whites, or for CHD or all-cause mortality among blacks or whites. The three-way interaction between sex, race, and diabetes on risk of cardiovascular outcomes was not significant (P=0.07).Overall, sex did not modify the cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes among older black or white adults. However, our results suggest that a possible sex interaction among older blacks merits further study."Heart	CLIN	"Women are more likely to develop heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) than men. We studied the relationship between sex and cardiovascular structure and function in patients with HFpEF.The study included 279 participants from the PARAMOUNT study (57% women) with analysable baseline echocardiograms (mean age 71 years, 94% hypertensive, 38% diabetic). We assessed sex-based differences in baseline clinical characteristics and measures of cardiovascular structure/function. Coronary artery disease was less common in women than in men. Women were more obese and symptomatic, and less likely to have albuminuria. Women had higher indexed left ventricular (LV) wall thicknesses, worse diastolic function (lower E', Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002; higher E/E', Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), while LV mass and LV volumes indexed for height(2.7) were similar. Nonetheless, female sex was associated with a trend towards higher prevalence of abnormal LV geometry (defined as concentric hypertrophy, or eccentric hypertrophy, or concentric remodelling) at baseline (unadjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰0.028, adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰0.056) and 12â€‰weeks' follow up (unadjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001, adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006), but not at 36â€‰weeks' follow up (unadjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰0.81, adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰0.99). Despite higher LV ejection fraction in women, global LV strain was similar between the sexes, while Tissue Doppler Imaging S' mitral velocity was lower in women. Both LV diastolic and systolic stiffness were higher in women than men (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), even adjusting for LV concentricity and clinical covariates. We observed no sex differences in systolic arterial-LV coupling, as women also had higher absolute arterial elastance compared with men, although this difference was not significant after adjusting for height(2.7) .More pronounced diastolic dysfunction may contribute to the greater predisposition for HFpEF in women compared with men."Heart	REVIEW	"All-cause mortality from cardiovascular disease is declining in the USA. However, there remains a significant difference in risk factors for disease and in mortality between men and women. For example, prevalence and outcomes for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction differ between men and women. The reasons for these differences are multifactorial, but reflect, in part, an incomplete understanding of sex differences in the etiology of cardiovascular diseases and a failure to account for sex differences in pre-clinical studies including those designed to develop new diagnostic and treatment modalities. This review focuses on the underlying physiology of these sex differences and provides evidence that inclusion of female animals in pre-clinical studies of heart failure and in development of imaging modalities to assess cardiac function might provide new information from which one could develop sex-specific diagnostic criteria and approaches to treatment. "Heart	OUTC	"Current data on the influence of sex on the prognosis of heart failure (HF) are conflicting, possibly owing to the use of different end points and a heterogeneous heart failure population in earlier studies. We sought to evaluate the effect of sex on the risk of early and late mortality outcomes after hospitalization for acute heart failure.The prospective cohort study population comprised 2,212 hospitalized patients with acute HF enrolled in a multicenter national survey in Israel. Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling was used to evaluate the effect of sex on the risk of early (â‰¤6 months) and late (>6 months to 4 years) mortality after the index hospitalization. Among the study patients, 998 (45%) were women. Women with HF displayed significantly different clinical characteristics compared with men, including older age, higher frequency of HF with preserved ejection fraction and hypertensive heart disease, and lower percentage of coronary artery disease (all P < .001). The fully adjusted multivariable analyses for mortality outcomes showed that women tended toward an increased risk for early (â‰¤6 months) mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.41; P = .13), whereas men had significantly increased risk for late (>6 months) mortality (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09-1.43; P = .001).There are important differences in the clinical characteristics and the short- and long-term outcomes between men and women hospitalized with acute HF after adjusting for multiple confounding variables."Heart	EPI	"Heart failure (HF) and obesity are associated with cognitive impairment. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between adiposity and cognitive functioning in HF for each sex, despite observed sex differences in HF prognosis. We tested the hypothesis that greater body mass index (BMI) would be associated with poorer cognitive functioning, especially in men, in sex-stratified analyses.Participants were 231 HF patients (34% female, 24% nonwhite, average age 68.7 Â± 7.3 years). Height and weight were used to compute BMI. A neuropsychology battery tested global cognitive function, memory, attention, and executive function. Composites were created using averages of age-adjusted scaled scores. Regressions adjusting for demographic and medical factors were conducted. The sample was predominantly overweight/obese (76.2%). For men, greater BMI predicted poorer attention (Î”R(2) = 0.03; Î² = -0.18; P = .01) and executive function (Î”R(2) = 0.02; Î² = -0.13; P = .04); these effects were largely driven by men with severe obesity (BMI â‰¥40 kg/m(2)). BMI did not predict memory (P = .69) or global cognitive functioning (P = .08). In women, greater BMI was not associated with any cognitive variable (all P â‰¥ .09).Higher BMI was associated with poorer attention and executive function in male HF patients, especially those with severe obesity. These patients may therefore have more difficulties with the HF treatment regimen and may have poorer outcomes."Heart	PP	"Inhibition of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) ameliorates pathological cardiac remodeling and has been gaining attention as a potential therapy for heart failure. Despite promising results in males, the efficacy of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil in female cardiac pathologies has not been determined and might be affected by estrogen levels, given the hormone's involvement in cGMP synthesis. Here, we determined that the heart-protective effect of sildenafil in female mice depends on the presence of estrogen via a mechanism that involves myocyte eNOS-dependent cGMP synthesis and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase IÎ± (PKGIÎ±). Sildenafil treatment failed to exert antiremodeling properties in female pathological hearts from GÎ±q-overexpressing or pressure-overloaded mice after ovary removal; however, estrogen replacement restored the effectiveness of sildenafil in these animals. In females, sildenafil-elicited myocardial PKG activity required estrogen, which stimulated tonic cardiomyocyte cGMP synthesis via an eNOS/soluble guanylate cyclase pathway. In contrast, eNOS activation, cGMP synthesis, and sildenafil efficacy were not estrogen dependent in male hearts. Estrogen and sildenafil had no impact on pressure-overloaded hearts from animals expressing dysfunctional PKGIÎ±, indicating that PKGIÎ± mediates antiremodeling effects. These results support the importance of sex differences in the use of PDE5 inhibitors for treating heart disease and the critical role of estrogen status when these agents are used in females. "Heart	OUTC	"Little is known about sex differences in the prevalence, treatment, and outcome of atrial fibrillation complicating acute heart failure.Among 957 patients (429 women, 528 men), included in the BIO-HF registry, 45.2% (nÂ = 194) of the women and 45.1% (nÂ = 238) of the men were admitted with atrial fibrillation. The primary end point was a composite of 1-year all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure. Adjusted 1-year mortality and hospitalization rates were similar between sexes (women 38.5%, men 36.0%; OR for female gender: 1.1, 95% CI 0.65-1.86; P = .71. A significant interaction between female sex and age (PÂ = .002) was observed; with worse prognosis for women <75 years (OR 7.17, 95% CI 1.79-28.66; PÂ = .005) compared with men <75 years. No sex differences in in-hospital treatment, restoration of sinus rhythm (16.5% in women vs 14.2% in men; PÂ = .58), or in-hospital mortality (5.7% in women vs 6.7% in men; PÂ = .69) were observed.Among patients hospitalized with acute heart failure, no sex differences in the prevalence and management of atrial fibrillation were observed. In-hospital mortality and the composite of 1-year mortality and rehospitalization were not different between sexes, but a significant sex-age interaction was observed, with worse outcome in women <75 years versus men <75 years of age."Heart	PP	"Clinically, heart failure is an age-dependent pathological phenomenon and displays sex-specific characteristics. The renin-angiotensin system mediates cardiac pathology in heart failure. This study investigated the sexually dimorphic functional effects of ageing combined with angiotensin II (AngII) on cardiac muscle cell function, twitch and Ca(2+)-handling characteristics of isolated cardiomyocytes from young (~13 weeks) and aged (~87 weeks) adult wild type (WT) and AngII-transgenic (TG) mice. We hypothesised that AngII-induced contractile impairment would be exacerbated in aged female cardiomyocytes and linked to Ca(2+)-handling disturbances. AngII-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was evident in young adult mice of both sexes and accentuated by age (aged adult ~21-23 % increases in cell length relative to WT). In female AngII-TG mice, ageing was associated with suppressed cardiomyocyte contractility (% shortening, maximum rate of shortening, maximum rate of relaxation). This was associated with delayed cytosolic Ca(2+) removal during twitch relaxation (Tau ~20 % increase relative to young adult female WT), and myofilament responsiveness to Ca(2+) was maintained. In contrast, aged AngII-TG male cardiomyocytes exhibited peak shortening equivalent to young TG; yet, myofilament Ca(2+) responsiveness was profoundly reduced with ageing. Increased pro-arrhythmogenic spontaneous activity was evident with age and cardiac AngII overexpression in male mice (42-55 % of myocytes) but relatively suppressed in female aged transgenic mice. Female myocytes with elevated AngII appear more susceptible to an age-related contractile deficit, whereas male AngII-TG myocytes preserve contractile function with age but exhibit desensitisation of myofilaments to Ca(2+) and a heightened vulnerability to arrhythmic activity. These findings support the contention that sex-specific therapies are required for the treatment of age-progressive heart failure."Heart	REVIEW	Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is frequently associated with multiple disorders complicating both the clinical management and the understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This review focuses on the causes and pathophysiology of HFPEF and overviews how cellular and molecular changes related to various comorbidities may influence the age-dependent and gender-dependent hemodynamic alterations of diastolic ventricular function. Heart	CLIN	"The gender differences in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) remain to be fully elucidated in the Japanese population.Substantial gender differences exist in stage C/D CHF patients in real-world practice in Japan. Although female CHF patients had better survival than male patients after adjustment for baseline differences, crude mortality rate was similar between the genders, possibly reflecting relatively severer clinical manifestations in women.â€‚â€‚"Heart	REVIEW	"Sex-based differences exist in the circulating concentrations of certain novel and established biomarkers in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and heart failure (HF). However, to date, few studies have compared the diagnostic and prognostic utility of these markers in men vs women.This mini-review contains a discussion of the published reports of studies that have explored whether differences in biomarker concentrations exist between men and women with ACS or HF. It also examines those studies that have compared the utility of biomarkers for diagnosis or risk stratification in women vs men. Because biomarkers are often used to make therapeutic and triage decisions in patient care, the potential clinical implications for any observed differences in biomarker reference limits for men and women is discussed.Although the concentration distributions may differ between men and women for certain biomarkers in clinical use, the clinical implications of these observations remain unclear. Because elements of the pathophysiology of ACS and HF may differ between the sexes, further research is needed to better evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of biomarkers in men vs women."Heart	EPI	"A B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) threshold of 100 pg/ml is used in practice for identification of heart failure, but data about the ""normal"" distribution of BNP in a large population in primary prevention are rare. We aimed to characterize the BNP distribution in a healthy subset of a population-based cohort and to evaluate the association of elevated BNP levels with major events.In a first step, we determined gender-specific distribution and 90th percentiles of BNP in participants who were at baseline free from known determinants of increased BNP, i.e. cardiovascular disease, hypertension or chronic kidney disease. Consecutively, the association of BNP levels above these 90th percentiles with subsequent cardiovascular and coronary events was assessed in the entire cohort.In the BNP-normal sub-sample (n = 1,639), we defined gender-specific 90th percentile of BNP (31.3 pg/ml for men, 45.5 pg/ml for women). From overall 3,697 subjects (mean age 59.4, 52.4 % female), 194 subjects developed a major cardiovascular event and 122 myocardial infarction during a mean follow-up period of 8.0 Â± 1.5 years. The 90th percentiles derived from the normal subset as threshold showed strong associations with major events in the entire cohort even after adjusting for traditional risk factors: hazard ratio (95% CI): 1.86 (1.37; 2.53), p < 0.0001 for cardiovascular, and 1.77 (1.19; 2.62), p = 0.005 for coronary events.The gender-specific 90th percentile of BNP (31 pg/ml for males and 45 pg/ml for females) obtained from a BNP-normal sub-sample is associated with incident major cardiovascular and coronary events, suggesting that even BNP values lower than 100 pg/ml could imply prognostic information in the general population."Heart	PP	"In pressure overload (PO), sex differences in humans and rodents have been well documented and estrogen receptor (ER) Î² is considered cardioprotective. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate sex- and ERÎ²-specific effects in protein abundance in PO employing a 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis/mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach. We hypothesized major sex differences and ERÎ²-specific alterations consistent with cardioprotection in females. Two-month old male and female wild-type (WT) and ERÎ² knockout (BERKO) mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 9 weeks (n = 4/group). In WT mice, hypertrophy was significantly more pronounced in males than females, while this sex difference was abolished in BERKO mice. We found 82 protein spots modulated between TAC and sham in WT males, 31 in WT females, 114 in BERKO males, and 87 in BERKO females (P â‰¤ 0.05). Our analysis revealed in WT and BERKO females an altered pattern of various proteins involved in structure and suggests a link between female sex and cytoskeletal integrity. In males, a set of proteins was identified that associate with mitochondrial bioenergetics and energy supply. We confirmed protein regulation by immunoblotting analysis. In conclusion, the proteomic response of the heart to PO is significantly modulated by ERÎ² and sex. We put forward that the observed differences may identify sex-specific targets for the treatment of heart failure, contributing toward more personalized medical care. "Heart	REVIEW	"The emergency department (ED) is the point of first contact for patients with acute heart failure and arrhythmias, with 1 million annual ED visits in the United States. Although the total numbers of men and women living with heart failure are similar, female patients are underrepresented in clinical studies, with current knowledge predominantly based on data from male patients. This has led to an underappreciation of the sex-specific differences in clinical characteristics and pathophysiology-based management of heart failure. Similar disparities have been found in management of acute arrhythmias, especially atrial arrhythmias that lead to an increased risk of stroke in women. Additionally, peripartum and postpartum cardiomyopathy represent a diagnostic and treatment dilemma. This article is the result of a breakout session in the cardiovascular and resuscitation work group of the 2014 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference ""Gender-Specific Research in Emergency Medicine: Investigate, Understand, and Translate How Gender Affects Patient Outcomes."" A nominal group technique was used to identify and prioritize themes and research questions using electronic mail, monthly conference calls, in-person meetings, and Web-based surveys between June 2013 and May 2014. Consensus was achieved through three rounds of nomination followed by the meeting on May 13, 2014, and resulted in seven priority themes that are essential to the common complex clinical syndrome of heart failure for both men and women and include the areas of pathophysiology; presentation and symptomatology; and diagnostic strategies using biomarkers, treatment, and mortality, with special consideration to arrhythmia management and pregnancy."Heart	PP	"Mammalian hearts express two myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms, which drive contractions with different kinetics and power-generating ability. The expression of the isoform that is associated with more rapid contraction kinetics and greater power output, MHC-Î±, is downregulated, with a concurrent increase in the relative amount of the slower isoform, MHC-Î², during the progression to experimentally induced or disease-related heart failure. This change in protein expression has been well studied in right and left ventricles in heart failure models and in humans with failure. Relatively little quantitative data exists regarding MHC isoform expression shifts in human failing atria. We previously reported significant increases in the relative amount of MHC-Î² in the human failing left atrium. The results of that study suggested that there might be a sex-related difference in the level of MHC-Î² in the left atrium, but the number of female subjects was insufficient for statistical analysis. The objective of this study was to test whether there is, in fact, a sex-related difference in the level of MHC-Î² in the right and left atria of humans with cardiomyopathy. The results indicate that significant differences exist in atrial MHC isoform expression between men and women who are in failure. The results also revealed an unexpected twofold greater amount of MHC-Î² in the nonfailing left atrium of women, compared with men. The observed sex-related differences in MHC isoform expression could impact ventricular diastolic filling during normal daily activities, as well as during physiologically stressful events. "Heart	MANAG	"Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) improve survival in certain high arrhythmic risk populations. However, there are sex differences regarding both the utilization and the benefit of these devices. Using a prospective national ICD registry, we aim to compare the indications for ICD implantation as well as outcomes in implanted women vs. men.All subjects implanted with an ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRTD) in Israel between July 2010 and February 2013 were included. A total of 3544 subjects constructed the baseline cohort, of whom 615 (17%) were women. Women had the same age (64 years) and rate of secondary prevention indication (26%) as men. However, women were more likely than men to have significant heart failure symptoms (52 vs. 45%), QRS > 120 ms (41 vs. 36%), and a higher rate of non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (54 vs. 21%, all P values <0.05). Using multivariate analysis, women were more likely to undergo CRTD implantation (odds ratio = 1.8, P < 0.01). Follow-up data were available for 1518 subjects with a mean follow-up of 12 months. During follow-up, there were no significant differences among genders in the rate of any single or the combined outcomes of appropriate device therapies, heart failure admissions, or death. First-year re-intervention rate was double among women (5.6 vs. 3.0%, P < 0.01).In real-world setting, women implanted with an ICD differ significantly from men in their baseline characteristics and in the use of CRTD devices. These, however, did not translate into outcome differences."Heart	EPI	"Depression is common in patients with heart failure. The prevalence of depression is known to differ in male and female patients with heart failure, but little is known about whether these patients differ in predictors of depression. The purposes of this study were to: (1) determine whether the prevalence of depression in patients with heart failure differed by gender: (2) examine if predictors of depression differed by patient gender.In this cross-sectional observational study, 147 patients with a primary diagnosis of heart failure completed five self-report questionnaires: demographic and clinical characteristic questionnaire, Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Social Support Scale and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. Data were analyzed with logistic regression.The majority of subjects were male (54.4%), with a mean age of 71.04 Â± 13.29 years and mean ejection fraction of 46.42 Â± 17.02%. About two-thirds of male patients (65%) and of female patients (65.7%) had significant depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II score â‰¥14). More female than male patients had moderate or severe depressive symptoms. Stratified analyses revealed that significant independent predictors of depressive symptoms among males were being unemployed (odds ratio=.09, 95% confidence intervals=.02- .54), lower ejection fraction (odds ratio=.96, 95% confidence intervals=.92-1.00), and worse quality of life (odds ratio=1.09, 95% confidence intervals=1.05-1.14); among females, predictors were uncertainty (odds ratio=1.09, 95% confidence intervals=1.04-1.32) and worse quality of life (odds ratio=1.17, 95% confidence intervals=1.08-1.48).Different variables predicted the presence of significant depressive symptoms in male and female patients with heart failure, but quality of life was an important factor in predicting depression in both genders."Heart	MANAG	"The authors hypothesized that the women enrolled in the HF-ACTION (Heart Failure-A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise TraiNing) trial and randomly assigned to exercise training (ET) would improve functional capacity as measured by peak oxygen uptake (VO2) compared with those in the usual care group. Furthermore, they hypothesized that the improvement in peak VO2 would correlate with prognosis. They explored whether exercise had a differential effect on outcomes in women versus men.There is less evidence for the benefit of ET in women with heart failure (HF) compared with men because of the small numbers of women studied.HF-ACTION was a randomized trial of ET versus usual care in 2,331 patients with class II-IV HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction of â‰¤35%. Sex differences in the effects of randomized treatment on clinical outcomes were assessed through the use of a series of Cox proportional hazards models, controlling for covariates known to affect prognosis in HF-ACTION.Women had lower baseline peak VO2 and 6-min walk distance than did men (median, 13.4 vs. 14.9 ml/min/kg and 353 vs. 378 m, respectively). An increase in peak VO2 at 3 months was present in women and men in the ET group (mean Â± SD; median, 0.88 Â± 2.2, 0.80 and 0.77 Â± 2.7, 0.60, respectively, women vs. men; p = 0.42). Women randomly assigned to ET had a significant reduction in the primary endpoint, (hazard ratio: 0.74) compared with men (hazard ratio: 0.99) randomly assigned to ET, with a significant treatment-by-sex interaction (p = 0.027).Although there is no significant difference between men and women in the effect of ET on peak VO2 change at 3 months, ET in women with HF is associated with a larger reduction in rate of the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and hospital stay than in men."Heart	EPI	"To evaluate differences in first manifestations of cardiovascular disease between men and women in a competing risks framework.Prospective population based cohort study.People living in the community in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.8419 participants (60.9% women) aged â‰¥ 55 and free from cardiovascular disease at baseline.First diagnosis of coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction, revascularisation, and coronary death), cerebrovascular disease (stroke, transient ischaemic attack, and carotid revascularisation), heart failure, or other cardiovascular death; or death from non-cardiovascular causes. Data were used to calculate lifetime risks of cardiovascular disease and its first incident manifestations adjusted for competing non-cardiovascular death.During follow-up of up to 20.1 years, 2888 participants developed cardiovascular disease (826 coronary heart disease, 1198 cerebrovascular disease, 762 heart failure, and 102 other cardiovascular death). At age 55, overall lifetime risks of cardiovascular disease were 67.1% (95% confidence interval 64.7% to 69.5%) for men and 66.4% (64.2% to 68.7%) for women. Lifetime risks of first incident manifestations of cardiovascular disease in men were 27.2% (24.1% to 30.3%) for coronary heart disease, 22.8% (20.4% to 25.1%) for cerebrovascular disease, 14.9% (13.3% to 16.6%) for heart failure, and 2.3% (1.6% to 2.9%) for other deaths from cardiovascular disease. For women the figures were 16.9% (13.5% to 20.4%), 29.8% (27.7% to 31.9%), 17.5% (15.9% to 19.2%), and 2.1% (1.6% to 2.7%), respectively. Differences in the number of events that developed over the lifespan in women compared with men (per 1000) were -7 for any cardiovascular disease, -102 for coronary heart disease, 70 for cerebrovascular disease, 26 for heart failure, and -1 for other cardiovascular death; all outcomes manifested at a higher age in women. Patterns were similar when analyses were restricted to hard atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes, but absolute risk differences between men and women were attenuated for both coronary heart disease and stroke.At age 55, though men and women have similar lifetime risks of cardiovascular disease, there are considerable differences in the first manifestation. Men are more likely to develop coronary heart disease as a first event, while women are more likely to have cerebrovascular disease or heart failure as their first event, although these manifestations appear most often at older ages."Heart	REVIEW	"There are important gender differences in cardiac electrophysiology that may affect effectiveness of cardiac arrhythmias invasive treatment. Women present to catheter ablation later, with more symptoms, and after having failed more antiarrhythmic drugs. Catheter ablation of supraventricular tachycardias and atrial fibrillation (AF), except for long lasting AF, appears equally effective in the two genders. However, female gender predicted a higher risk of complications, with vascular access complications being the most frequent events. The role of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) in women with heart failure for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death has not been well established. Women are underrepresented in primary prevention implantable ICD trials, and data on the benefit of ICD therapy in this subgroup are controversial. Further studies are needed to define the population of women who may benefit most from ICD therapy."Heart	PP	"Diabetic women are five times more likely to develop congestive heart failure compared with two fold for men. The underlying mechanism for this gender difference is not known. Here we investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this female disadvantage and attempt safeguarding cardiomyocytes viability and function through restoration of pro-survival Pim-1.Diabetes was induced by injection of streptozotocin in CD1 mice of both genders. Functional and dimensional parameters measurement using echocardiography revealed diastolic dysfunction in female diabetic mice within 8 weeks after STZ-induced diabetes. This was associated with significant downregulation of pro-survival Pim-1 and upregulation of pro-apoptotic Caspase-3, microRNA-1 and microRNA-208a. Male diabetic mice did not show any significant changes at this time point (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 vs. female diabetic). Further, the onset of ventricular remodelling was quicker in female diabetic mice showing marked left ventricular dilation, reduced ejection fraction and poor contractility (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 vs. male diabetic at 12 and 16 weeks of STZ-induced diabetes). Molecular analysis of samples from human diabetic hearts confirmed the results of pre-clinical studies, showing marked downregulation of Pim-1 in the female diabetic heart (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 vs. male diabetic). Finally, in vitro restoration of Pim-1 reversed the female disadvantage in diabetic cardiomyocytes.We provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms behind the rapid onset of cardiomyopathy in female diabetics. These results suggest the requirement for the development of gender-specific treatments for diabetic cardiomyopathy."Heart	OUTC	"Gender-related differences in clinical phenotype, in-hospital management and prognosis of acute heart failure (AHF) patients have been previously reported in European and US registries. The ALARM-HF survey is the first to include a cohort of 4953 patients hospitalized for AHF in 666 hospitals in 6 European countries, Mexico and Australia.Women accounted for 37% of the study population, were older and had higher rates of de novo heart failure (45% vs 36%, p<0.001) than men. An acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was the predominant precipitating factor in both genders, but to a lesser extent in females (30% vs 42%, p<0.001). Between genders comparison showed higher incidence of atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, diabetes, obesity, anemia and depression in women (p<0.05). Similarly, women had higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on admission (42 Â± 15% vs 36 Â± 13%, p<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (135 Â± 40 mm Hg vs 131 Â± 39 mm Hg, p=0.001) than men. On the other hand, men had more often coronary artery disease, renal failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p<0.05). Importantly, in-hospital mortality was similar in both genders (11.1% in females vs 10.5% in males, p=0.475), and its common predictors were: systolic blood pressure at admission, creatinine>1.5mg/dL and diabetes. Furthermore, recent ACS, valvular heart disease and dementia contributed to prognosis in women, while LVEF, hypertension and anemia were independent predictors in men.Among patients with AHF, there are significant differences in co-morbidities, precipitating factors and predictors of in-hospital mortality between genders. Nevertheless, in-hospital mortality remains similar between genders."Heart		"In pressure overload, profibrotic gene expression and cardiac fibrosis are more pronounced in males than in females. Sex-specific and estrogen-dependent regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), such as miR-21, may be a potential mechanism leading to sex differences in fibrosis.To analyze the influence of sex, estrogen, and estrogen receptor beta (ERÎ²) on the expression of miR-21 and to identify additional miRNAs potentially involved in sex-specific pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling.The sex-specific regulation of fibrosis-related miRNAs was analyzed in male and female wild type and ERÎ²-deficient mice after transverse aortic constriction (TAC), in rat fibroblasts, and in a cardiomyocyte-like cell line.We report the sex-specific expression of functionally-related miR-21, -24, -27a, -27b, 106a, -106b and the regulation of their expression by estrogen in a sex-specific manner. These effects were abolished in ERÎ²-deficient mice. We demonstrate the presence of common functional target sites for these miRNAs on three repressors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, i.e. Rasa1, Rasa2 and Spry1, which may all lead to cardiac fibrosis. As expected, transfection with miRNA mimics targeting these repressors induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation.Estrogen regulates a network of miRNAs in a sex-specific manner via ERÎ². Our data suggest that the sex-specific expression of these miRNAs may be related to sex differences in fibrosis after pressure overload."Heart	EPI	"Sex-related factors play an important role in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF). However, trends in sex-related differences in hospital management for HF are not clear. We identified patients hospitalized for HF through a nationwide database (National Health Insurance in Taiwan), containing 722,272 subjects from 1999 to 2008. Higher incidences of diabetes mellitus (37 vs. 25Â %, pÂ <Â 0.001), thyroid dysfunction (2 vs. 0Â %, pÂ <Â 0.001), and transient cerebral ischemia (2 vs. 1Â %, pÂ <Â 0.05), as well as a lower incidence of chronic lung disease (14 vs. 22Â %, pÂ <Â 0.001) differentiated female HF patients from male HF patients. During this 10-year period, both percentage of HF hospitalization and age-adjusted HF rates significantly increased for total HF sample (1.92 vs. 2.49 Â â€°, pÂ <Â 0.05, and 20.44 vs. 27.38/100,000, pÂ <Â 0.05) and for female (1.76 vs. 2.86 Â â€°, pÂ <Â 0.05, and 20.94 vs. 32.12/100,000, pÂ <Â 0.05), but such changes did not occur among male patients (2.12 vs. 2.09 Â â€°, pÂ >Â 0.05, and 19.93 vs. 22.51/100,000, pÂ >Â 0.05). The age at the time of hospitalization and the length of the hospital stay increased significantly for all HF patients during the 10-year study period. However, the daily cost of hospitalization increased in males, but not in females. Compared to the survivors, patients who died were older and had a longer hospitalization and higher daily cost both in males and females. Through our analysis of the NHI database, we observed trends in factors related to hospitalization of HF patients in Taiwan that may be attributable to sex-related differences in the pathophysiology and treatment strategies for HF. "Heart	CLIN	"Ventricular-arterial coupling is a key determinant of cardiovascular performance. However, little is known about the gender differences in ventricular-arterial interactions in the healthy Chinese population.To identify gender differences in the association between carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and cardiac diastolic function in healthy Chinese individuals.We examined 852 healthy participants (aged 30-98 years, 46% men) in 3 northern China cities with the use of M-mode ultrasonography to analyze CIMT and cardiac structure and function. Cardiac function was measured by determining the ratio of early-diastolic peak flow velocity (E) and late-diastolic peak flow velocity (A), as well as the deceleration time of the early mitral velocity (MV-DT). Cardiac dysfunction was defined as E/A values <25th percentile (E/A <0.78 for men and <0.79 for women), left atrial volume (LAV) values >75th percentile (LAV >34.9 mL for men and >32.2 mL for women), and MV-DT values >75th percentile (MV-DT >210 ms for men and >195 ms for women). CIMT, E/A, LAV, and MV-DT were significantly correlated with age in both men (CIMT: rÂ = 0.418, PÂ <Â .01; E/A: rÂ = -0.325, P < .01, LAV: rÂ = 0.123, P < .05; MV-DT: rÂ = 0.175, P < .01) and women (CIMT: rÂ = 0.429, P < .01; E/A: rÂ = -0.423, P < .01; LAV: rÂ = 0.180, P < .01; MV-DT: rÂ = 0.174, PÂ < .01). Interestingly, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was not significantly correlated with age in either gender. CIMT was significantly associated with a lower E/A in an unadjusted model in tertiles II and III. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) for men were 2.428 (1.36-4.335) and 3.017 (1.674-5.437), respectively. However, this association disappeared with age adjustment. The odds ratios (95% CI) for women were 3.298 (1.742-6.246) and 6.002 (3.202-11.251), respectively, and these were still significant after adjustments for all other variables, including age, blood pressure, blood lipid, and inflammatory markers (tertile II: 3.031, 95% CI 1.228-7.48; tertile III: 3.224, 95% CI 1.308-7.946). A higher MV-DT was significantly correlated with higher CIMT only in an unadjusted model for women, and this association was lost with age adjustment. There was no significant association between CIMT and higher LAV values.Age-related increases in CIMT were correlated with a decline in cardiac diastolic function only in women, which may contribute to the higher incidence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction."Heart	Review	"Chronic heart failure (HF) is a major health problem throughout the world. Gender has significant effects on the pathophysiology of HF. Low levels of free testosterone are independently associated with increased chronic HF symptoms and mortality. Cardiac fibrosis plays a pivotal role in structural remodeling in HF. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î², angiotensin II and oxidative stress contribute to the activity/extent of cardiac fibrosis. Androgen deficiency can up-regulate TGF-Î² expression under angiotensin II stimulation in vivo. In this review, we summarized the potential mechanisms accounting for the effects of androgen on cardiac fibrosis through regulating fibrocytes activity under TGF, which can explain wound healing and cardiac fibrosis in male with acute myocardial injury and chronic HF."Heart	CLIN	"Studies about stroke in Saudi Arabia are limited. This retrospective study aims to determine the clinical characteristics of Saudi patients with heart failure (HF) with and without subsequent stroke, and also to find out whether gender differences exist in the presentation of HF patients who had stroke.Retrospective study done at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from 2002-2008.A total of 293 patient (151 males, 142 females) charts from 2002-2008 were re.viewed at KAMC. These charts were from Saudi patients who were diagnosed with HF, with and without subsequent stroke. Demographics, HF characteristics, stroke risk factors, and metabolic characteristics were noted and analyzed.No difference was observed in HF characteristics and stroke risk factors among HF patients with and without subsequent stroke. In terms of metabolic profile, those who had stroke had significantly higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL)--cholesterol levels as compared to those without (P=.03). Stratification to gender and adjusting for age and risk factors revealed that significantly higher LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol levels were observed in female stroke patients (P values .02, .028, respectively) and significantly higher blood urea nitrogen levels were observed in male stroke patients (P=.04) as compared to their counterparts who never had a stroke.The gender differences in the metabolic presentation of Saudi HF patients with stroke warrant further clinical investigation. Atherogenic dyslipidemia and renal insufficiency are suggested to be early predic.tors for stroke and should be closely monitored in Saudi HF patients."Heart	CLIN	"Peak oxygen consumption (VO2) predictive authority in heart failure (HF) has been established from male cohorts. We evaluated the gender impact on the prognostic meaning of low peak VO2.We followed 529 HF patients (116 female), with peak VO2 â‰¤ 14 mL/kg/min, until cardiovascular death (CVD) and urgent heart transplantation.During follow up, 156 (29%) patients had cardiac events. Female gender, age, left ventricular ejection fraction, peak VO2, peak systolic blood pressure, and beta-blocker treatment all contributed to increase the risk ability of the hierarchical multivariate model. Two-year survival was higher in women: 85 vs 66%; Ï‡(2)=15.7, p<0.0001. Peculiarly, outcome results were similar when only CVD was considered. Females showed a multivariate adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.46. Since a 1-mL/kg/min increment in peak VO2 was equated with a 12% improvement in prognosis, the same gender adjusted HR was achieved when mean peak VO2 was reduced by 5 units in women: thus, a HF woman with peak VO2 of 9 mL/kg/min has the same 2-year outcome as a HF man with peak VO2 of 14 mL/kg/min.Although HF women have a comparatively lower peak VO2 than men, they live longer. We discovered that the traditional cut point value for peak VO2, i.e. â‰¤ 14 mL/kg/min is not a ""gender-neutral"" reference since lumping HF men and women together with the same VO2 value is unlikely to describe the true risk. These preliminary findings do underline the need to assimilate gender-specific issues into clinical practice in HF, when appropriate."Heart	OUTC	"The burden of heart failure (HF)-related hospitalization and mortality of female patients with HF is substantial. Currently, several gender-specific distinctions have been recognized amongst HF patients, but their relationships to outcomes have not been fully elucidated. Accordingly, in the current work, we aimed to explore gender-specific clinical and echocardiographic measures and to assess their potential impact on outcome.We studied all consecutive HF patients, aged 50 or older, who had been hospitalized between January 2000 and December 2009, and had undergone at least one echocardiography study. A comparative analysis of clinical and echocardiographic findings was performed between 5228 males and 4107 females. Patients were followed for a mean of 2.8 Â± 2.6 years. Females compared with males had less ischaemic heart disease, prior stroke, chronic renal failure, and COPD, and higher rates of hypertension, AF, obesity, valvular abnormalities, and pulmonary hypertension. Unadjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were higher among women, while age-adjusted rates were similar. Predictors of outcomes varied between genders. Female-specific predictors of mortality included aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, and malignancy, whereas diastolic dysfunction and chronic renal failure were found to be male-specific predictors.Age-adjusted mortality rates of male and female hospitalized HF patients are similarly high. Predictors of mortality, however, are gender distinctive, and these measures may allow a better identification of high-risk HF patients."Heart	Clinical	"This study sought to assess sex differences in ventricular-arterial interactions.Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is more prevalent in women than in men, but the basis for this difference remains unclear.Echocardiography and arterial tonometry were performed to quantify arterial and ventricular stiffening and interaction in 461 participants without heart failure (189 men, age 67 Â± 9 years; 272 women, age 65 Â± 10 years). Aortic characteristic impedance (Z(c)), total arterial compliance (pulsatile load), and systemic vascular resistance index (steady load) were compared between men and women, and sex-specific multivariable regression analyses were performed to assess associations of these arterial parameters with diastolic dysfunction and ventricular-arterial coupling (effective arterial elastance/left ventricular end-systolic elastance [Ea/Ees]) after adjustment for potential confounders.Z(c) was higher and total arterial compliance was lower in women, whereas systemic vascular resistance index was similar between sexes. In women but not men, higher log Z(c) was associated with mitral inflow E/A ratio (Î² Â± SE: -0.17 Â± 0.07), diastolic dysfunction (odds ratio: 7.8; 95% confidence interval: 2.0 to 30.2) and Ea/Ees (Î² Â± SE: 0.13 Â± 0.04) (p â‰¤ 0.01 for all). Similarly, total arterial compliance was associated with E/A ratio (Î² Â± SE: 0.12 Â± 0.04), diastolic dysfunction (odds ratio: 0.33; 95% confidence interval: 0.12 to 0.89), and Ea/Ees (Î² Â± SE: -0.09 Â± 0.03) in women only (p â‰¤ 0.03 for all). Systemic vascular resistance index was not associated with diastolic dysfunction or Ea/Ees.Proximal aortic stiffness (Z(c)) is greater in women than men, and women may be more susceptible to the deleterious effects of greater pulsatile and early arterial load on diastolic function and ventricular-arterial interaction. This may contribute to the greater risk of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in women."Heart	OUTC	"In heart failure (HF), there are known differences in plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels between reduced and preserved ejection fraction (EF), but few HF studies have explored sex differences. We sought to evaluate the relationship between sex, EF, and BNP in HF patients and determine prognostic significance of BNP as it relates to sex and EF.We included hospitals in Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure that admitted 99,930 HF patients with reduced (EF <40%), borderline (EF 40%-49%), or preserved (EF â‰¥50%) EF. The primary end point was inhospital mortality. Multivariate models were used to compute odds ratios while accounting for hospital clustering.There were 47,025 patients with reduced (37% female), 13,950 with borderline (48% female), and 38,955 with preserved (65% female) EF. Women compared with men had higher admission median BNP levels with the greatest difference among reduced EF and smallest difference among preserved EF (median BNP in women vs men: EF reduced 1,259 vs 1,113 pg/mL, borderline 821 vs 732 pg/mL, and preserved 559 vs 540 pg/mL; P < .001 all comparisons). Ejection fraction and sex were independently associated with BNP. Inhospital mortality was 2.7%, and patients above the median BNP level had higher mortality than those below. After adjusting for over 20 clinical variables, the ability of BNP to predict inhospital mortality was similar among all subgroups (P for heterogeneity = .47).In a large registry, we found that despite sex/EF differences in BNP values, there was no significant difference in the ability of BNP to predict inhospital mortality among these subgroups."Heart	CLIN	"Despite disparities in pathophysiology and disease manifestation between male and female patients with heart failure, studies focusing on sex differences in biomarkers are scarce. The purpose of this study was to assess sex-specific variation in clinical characteristics and biomarker levels to gain more understanding of the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying sex differences in heart failure.Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, multiple biomarkers, and outcomes were compared between men and women in 567 patients. The mean age of the study group was 71 Â± 11 years and 38% were female. Women were older, had a higher body mass index and left ventricular ejection fraction, more hypertension, and received more diuretic and antidepressant therapy, but less ACE-inhibitor therapy compared with men. After 3 years, all-cause mortality was lower in women than men (37.0 vs. 43.9%, multivariable hazard ratio = 0.64; 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.92, P = 0.016). Levels of biomarkers related to inflammation [C-reactive protein, pentraxin 3, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), and interleukin 6] and extracellular matrix remodelling (syndecan-1 and periostin) were significantly lower in women compared with men. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, TNF-Î±R1a, and GDF-15 showed the strongest interaction between sex and mortality.Female heart failure patients have a distinct clinical presentation and better outcomes compared with male patients. The lower mortality was independent of differences in clinical characteristics, but differential sex associations between several biomarkers and mortality might partly explain the survival difference."Heart	OUTC	"Earlier work has demonstrated significant sex and age disparities in ischemic heart disease. However, it remains unclear if an age or sex gap exists for heart failure (HF) patients.Using data from the 2007-2008 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, we constructed hierarchic regression models to examine sex differences and age-sex interactions in HF hospitalizations and in-hospital mortality. Among 430,665 HF discharges, 51% were women and 0.3%, 27%, and 73% were aged <25, 25-64, and >64 years respectively. There were significant sex differences among HF risk factors, with a higher prevalence of coronary disease among men. Men had higher hospitalization rates for HF and in-hospital mortality across virtually all ages. The relationship between age and HF mortality appeared U-shaped; mortality rates for ages <25, 25-64, and >64 years were 2.9%, 1.4%, and 3.8%, respectively. No age-sex interaction was found for in-hospital mortality for adults >25 years old.Using a large nationally representative administrative dataset we found age and sex disparities in HF outcomes. In general, men fared worse than women regardless of age. Furthermore, we found a U-shaped relationship between age and in-hospital mortality during an HF hospitalization, such that young adults have similar mortality rates to older adults. Additional studies are warranted to elucidate the patient-specific and treatment characteristics that result in these patterns."Heart	OUTC	"Understanding the influence of sex differences on predictors of cardiac mortality rates in chronic heart failure might enable us to lengthen lifetimes and to improve lives. This study describes the influence of sex on cardiovascular mortality rates among chronic heart failure patients. From January 2003 through December 2009, we evaluated 637 consecutive patients (409 men and 228 women) with chronic heart failure, who ranged in age from 18 through 94 years (mean age, 64 Â± 13 yr) and ranged in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class from II through IV. The mean follow-up period was 38 Â± 15 months, the mean age was 64 Â± 13 years, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.27 Â±0.11. By the end of the study, both sexes had similar cardiovascular mortality rates (36% men vs 37% women, P=0.559). In Cox regression analysis, NYHA functional class, triglyceride level, and history of coronary artery disease were independent predictors of cardiovascular death for women with chronic heart failure. For men with chronic heart failure, the patient's age, ejection fraction, and sodium level were independent predictors of cardiovascular death. In a modern tertiary referral heart failure clinic, decreased triglyceride levels were, upon univariate analysis, predictors of poor outcomes for both men and women. However, upon Cox regression analysis, reduced triglyceride levels were independent predictors of cardiac death only in women. "Heart	Outcomes	"There are few sex-specific outcome data in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.We assessed sex differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes among 4128 patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the Irbesartan in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (I-PRESERVE) trial. Women (n=2491) with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction were â‰ˆ1 year older (72Â±7 years versus 71Â±7 years) and more likely to be obese (46% versus 35%) and have chronic kidney disease (34% versus 26%) and hypertension (91% versus 85%) than men but less likely to have an ischemic cause (19% versus 34%), atrial fibrillation (27% versus 33%), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8% versus 13%) (all P<0.001). During a mean of 49.5 months, there were 881 deaths (447 in women, 434 in men; risk ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.56-0.74) and 5776 hospitalizations (3239 in women, 2537 in men; risk ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.76-0.84). Women had lower risk of all-cause events (deaths and hospitalizations), even after adjusting for baseline characteristics (adjusted hazards ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.89). However, the sex-related difference in risk of all-cause events was modified in the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation, renal dysfunction, stable angina pectoris, or advanced New York Heart Association class symptoms.In patients with typical heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, there were prominent sex differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes. Women had better overall prognosis, although the presence of 4 common baseline characteristics seemed to moderate this finding."Heart	Clinical	"(i) To compare the prevalence and severity of depressive symptoms between men and women enrolled in a large heart failure (HF) registry. (ii) To determine gender differences in predictors of depressive symptoms from demographic, behavioral, clinical, and psychosocial factors in HF patients.In 622 HF patients (70% male, 61 Â± 13 years, 59% NYHA class III/IV), depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Potential correlates were age, ethnicity, education, marital and financial status, smoking, exercise, body mass index (BMI), HF etiology, NYHA class, comorbidities, functional capacity, anxiety, and perceived control. To identify gender-specific correlates of depressive symptoms, separate logistic regression models were built by gender.Correlates of depressive symptoms in men were financial status (p = 0.027), NYHA (p = 0.001); functional capacity (p < 0.001); health perception (p = 0.043); perceived control (p = 0.002) and anxiety (p < 0.001). Correlates of depressive symptoms in women were BMI (p = 0.003); perceived control (p = 0.013) and anxiety (p < 0.001).In HF patients, lowering depressive symptoms may require gender-specific interventions focusing on weight management in women and improving perceived functional capacity in men. Both men and women with HF may benefit from anxiety reduction and increased control."Heart	Management	"In recent years epidemiological and clinical evidence has shown gender disparities in several aspects of cardiovascular disease. Aim of this study was to identify gender differences in the clinical profile and management of patients admitted to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs.Patients enrolled in the ISYDE-2008 survey were considered.The ISYDE-2008 survey enrolled 2281 patients; 604 (26.5%) were women. Compared to men, women were older (mean age 70.8 Â± 11.5 versus men's 65.6 Â± 11.5 years), had less traditional risk factors (low cardiovascular risk profile in 45.3% of women and 38.0% of men, p=0.003), were more frequently admitted after valvular surgery and heart failure, but less for post-acute myocardial infarction and post-by-pass procedure. Women were more frequently admitted to an in-hospital rehabilitation program. Women showed a more complicated acute and rehabilitative course, with 63.2% of them having at least one complication during acute-phase, compared to 52.5% of men, and 48.3% during rehabilitation, compared to 35.0% of men (p<0.0001). During rehabilitation, women underwent exercise tests less frequently, except for the 6-minute walking test. At discharge, women received ACE-inhibitors/ARBs, Î²-blockers, statins, omega-3 fatty acids, antiplatelet agents less frequently, but more frequently digoxin, amiodarone, diuretics, oral anticoagulants, insulin and anti-depressive drugs. The duration of the rehabilitation program was longer for women. Mortality was very low in the entire population.Women are less frequently admitted to CR than men. They are older and show a greater cardiovascular burden. Women are more likely to be enrolled in CR after valvular surgery and heart failure than men."Heart	Outcomes	"Whether sex differences in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) benefit exist remains unanswered. We evaluated sex differences in mode of death among a large cohort of ambulatory heart failure patients who meet criteria for a primary prevention ICD.Patients from 5 trials or registries were included if they met American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society guideline criteria for implantation of a primary prevention ICD. We investigated the potential sex differences in total deaths and total deaths by mode of death. The relationship between the estimated total mortality and mode of death by percentage of total mortality was also analyzed by sex. The Seattle Heart Failure Model was used to estimate total mortality in this analysis. A total of 8337 patients (1685 [20%] women) met inclusion criteria. One-year mortality was 10.8Â±0.3%. In women, the age-adjusted all-cause mortality was 24% lower (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.85; P<0.0001), the risk of sudden death was 31% lower (HR, 0.69; CI, 0.58-0.83; P<0.0001), but no significant difference in pump failure death was observed. Throughout a range of total mortality risk, women had a 20% lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.80; CI, 0.71-0.89; P<0.001) and 29% fewer deaths that were sudden (HR, 0.71; CI, 0.59-0.86;P<0.001) compared with men.Women with heart failure have a lower mortality than men, and fewer of those deaths are sudden throughout a spectrum of all-cause mortality risk. These data provide a plausible reason for and thus support the possibility that sex differences in ICD benefit may exist."Heart	Review	"Despite regional variations in the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), men are consistently more at risk of developing and dying from CAD than women, and the gender-specific effects of sex hormones are implicated in this inequality. This 'Perspectives' article reviews the current evidence regarding the cardiovascular effects of testosterone in men including an examination of the age-related decline in testosterone, the relationship between testosterone levels and coronary disease, coronary risk factors and mortality. We also review the vaso-active effects of testosterone, and discuss how these have been used in men with heart failure and angina. We discuss the 'cause' versus 'effect' controversy, regarding low testosterone levels in men with coronary heart disease, as well as concerns over the use of testosterone replacement therapy in middle aged and elderly men. The article concludes with a discussion regarding the future direction for work in this interesting area, including the relative merits of screening for, and treating hypogonadism with testosterone replacement therapy in men with heart disease."Heart	MANAG	"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a well established option in patients with moderate to severe heart failure on optimal medical therapy, NYHA functional class Ill-IV, reduced systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35%), broad QRS complex (>120 ms), but data addressing sex differences in response to CRT are lacking. Women are underrepresented in clinical and observational trials on CRT (<30%) but, when examining response across recent studies, there is evidence of a more positive effect of CRT in women. Also our data show that females seem to achieve a greater survival benefit with CRT than male recipients. While larger trials remain the ideal way to specifically address the question of a gender effect, with some uncertainties on the understanding of the greater benefit still present (specific factors intrinsic to women are responsible for this difference? pre-CRT clinical characteristics, prevalence of nonischemic cardiomyopathy and left bundle branch block, other than female gender itself?), current evidence supports the notion of increasing access to CRT for women with the appropriate indication, to allow them to exploit the distinctive benefits associated with this treatment strategy."Heart	CLIN	"Although one half of patients affected by heart failure (HF) are women, the clinical phenotype differs between genders. In women HF develops later in life, is more often associated with preserved systolic function and is less frequently attributable to ischemic heart disease. Although survival tends to be better in women than in men, females are more symptomatic, have a worse quality of life and a longer length of stay during acute HF admissions. Italian data from institutional databases of the Lazio, Basilicata and Veneto regions are in agreement with international evidences on this topic. Gender differences in clinical phenotypes are based on different structural and functional patterns: the female heart undergoes more often concentric remodeling, with thicker walls, smaller volumes and greater chamber stiffness. There are no specific therapeutic evidences for the elderly, prevalently female, HF population. Treatment strategies are derived from studies carried out in relatively young male populations with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Therapeutic strategies tailored to the peculiar female HF phenotype should be better explored in future treatment trials."Heart	CLIN	"The IN-HF Outcome registry enrolled 1855 patients admitted for acute heart failure and 3755 outpatients with chronic heart failure seen at 64 cardiology units of the Italian Network-Heart Failure. We assessed gender-related differences in clinical characteristics, management, and short- and long-term mortality and morbidity outcomes. Women were older, more often hypertensive and with a higher prevalence of heart failure with preserved systolic function. Aggressive management was less frequent in women who underwent less often diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. We found no gender-related differences in either acute or long-term mortality nor in hospital readmissions."Heart	Management	"Prior studies have demonstrated low use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) as primary prevention, particularly among women and blacks. The degree to which the overall use of ICD therapy and disparities in use have changed is unclear.We examined 11 880 unique patients with a history of heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction â‰¤35% who were â‰¥65 years old and enrolled in the Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) program from January 2005 through December 2009. We determined the rate of ICD use by year for the overall population and for sex and race groups. From 2005 to 2007, overall ICD use increased from 30.2% to 42.4% and then remained unchanged in 2008 to 2009. After adjustment for potential confounders, ICD use increased significantly in the overall study population during 2005 to 2007 (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.48 per year; P=0.0008) and in black women (odds ratio, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.58 per year; P=0.0008), white women (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.59 per year; P=0.010), black men (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.99 per year; P=0.0009), and white men (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.48 per year; P=0.0072). The increase in ICD use was greatest among blacks.In the GWTG-HF quality improvement program, a significant increase in ICD therapy use was observed over time in all sex and race groups. The previously described racial disparities in ICD use were no longer present by the end of the study period; however, sex differences persisted."Heart	Outcomes	"There are no sex-specific survival comparisons between patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced and those with preserved ejection fraction. Large registries noting women have better survival than men combined HF patients with reduced and preserved EF. Other registries that compared patients with reduced and preserved EF did not analyze their data by sex. We sought to evaluate sex/EF differences in mortality and risk factors for survival in hospitalized patients with HF.We included hospitals fully participating in Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure that admitted HF patients with reduced (EF <40%) or preserved (EF â‰¥50%) EF. The primary end point was in-hospital mortality. Multivariate generalized estimating equation logistic models were used to compute odds ratios accounting for hospital clustering.The study cohort consisted of 51,428 patients with EF <40% (36% women, 64% men) and 37,699 patients with EF â‰¥50% (65% women, 35% men). Women compared with men with reduced and preserved EF were older and more likely to have hypertension, depression, or valvular heart disease and less likely to have coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease. There were no sex differences in in-hospital mortality (EF <40%, 2.69% women vs 2.89% men, P = .20; EF â‰¥50%, 2.61% women vs 2.62% men, P = .96), and risk factors such as age, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and history of renal failure/dialysis were highly predictive of death for each sex/EF subgroup.In a large, multicenter registry, we found that despite differences in baseline characteristics, women and men with reduced and preserved EF have similar in-hospital mortality and risk factors predicting death."Heart	Clinical	"The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether there are gender differences in total cholesterol levels in patients with acute heart failure and if there is an association of this parameter with short and long time mortality.The AHEAD MAIN registry is a database conducted in 7 university hospitals, all with 24 h cath lab service, in 4 cities in the Czech Republic. The database included 4 153 patients hospitalised for acute heart failure in the period 2006-2009. 2 384 patients had a complete record of their total cholesterol levels. 946 females and 1437 males were included in this analysis. According to the admission total cholesterol levels, patients were divided into 5 groups: < 4.50 mmol/l (group A), 4.50-4.99 mmol/l (group B), 5.0-5.49 mmol/l (group C), 5.50-5.99 mmol/l (group D) and > 6.0 mmol/l (group E). The median total cholesterol levels were 4.24 in males and 4.60 in females (P<0.001). There were differences in the distribution of total cholesterol levels between men and women: group A 57.6 vs 45.0%, group B 13.8 vs 16.3%, group C 9.8 vs 12.5%, group D 7.7 vs 11.4%, group E 11.1 vs 14.8% respectively (all P<0.001). The median age of men was 68.7 vs 77.3 years in women (P<0.001). In all total cholesterol categories women were older than men: group A 77.7 vs 69.5 years, group B 78.6 vs 69.1 years, group C 77.3 vs 68.8 years, group D 76.8 vs 64.2 years, group E 75.6 vs 64.4 years (all P<0.001). For the calculation of long term mortality, the cohort was divided into three groups: total cholesterol levels below 4.50 mmol/l, 4.50-5.49 mmol/l and above 5.50 mmol/l. The log rank test was used for the analysis.There were no differences in hospital mortality between male and female in general (9.2 vs 10.8%, P<0.202), or in total cholesterol levels in subgroups. Total cholesterol levels were associated with in-hospital mortality (P<0.002). In the long-term follow up (78 months) patients with total cholesterol levels below 4.5 mmol/l had the worst prognosis (P<0.001). An independent influence of total cholesterol level on mortality and survival was confirmed in the multivariate model as well.Women with acute heart failure had higher total cholesterol levels than men in all ages. There was a higher percentage of women with total cholesterol levels above 6 mmol/l and lower percentage in the group below 4.5 mmol/l than in men. In all, total cholesterol categories women were older than men. Total cholesterol levels are important for in- hospital mortality and long term survival of patients admitted for acute heart failure."Heart	Review	"Heart failure (HF) has steadily increased in prevalence and affects both males and females equally. Despite this, there has been a significant underrepresentation of women in large scale HF trials. This disparity has lead to a deficit in understanding important gender-based differences in pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment strategies. We review these gaps and explore a biological basis for varying outcomes. Endogenous estrogen plays an important role in epidemiology and outcome. The administration of exogenous estrogen has had varied success in treatment and is outlined extensively below. Additionally, we highlight unique HF syndromes through pregnancy and important sex-specific issues concerning transplant and mechanical circulatory support. A central theme remains: there is a clear need for increased female recruitment in clinical trials, and more studies exploring the role of gender-based biology in HF treatment."Heart	Management	"Long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) with ventricular assist devices (VADs) is now an acceptable option for patients with end-stage heart failure (HF). There are growing numbers of reports identifying sex-related differences in the development and prognosis of HF and cardiac surgery. With the experience of 1,607 VAD implantations in our institution we are the first to analyze our data to determine gender distribution in our patient populations and the effect of gender on outcomes. Of the total 1,456 patients with MCS, 1,225 were male and 231 female. The patients were divided into three age groups-below 13 years (group 1, n = 100), between 13 and 50 years (group 2, n = 540) and older than 50 years (group 3, n = 824). Five-year survival, HF etiology, and procedural success, defined as 30-day and 5-year survival were analyzed retrospectively. In group 1 the gender distribution was equal; the leading HF etiology was dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP) with 17% in male (n = 17) and 19% in female (n = 19) patients, followed by congenital diseases (13% in male versus 9% in female) and postcardiotomy failure (13% in male versus 8% in female). No differences were seen in 5-year survival and procedural success. In group 2, significantly more men (n = 451, p < 0.0001) were supported by VADs. DCMP was the major cause for VAD implantation (54%) and was significantly more frequent in men (57.6%, p = <0.0001). Male patients were older (mean age = 37.1 years, p < 0.0001), with a longer median support time (151.6 days, p < 0.0001) and a higher median weight (78.2 kg, p < 0.0001). No difference was seen in procedural success whereas 5-year survival was better in men than in women (53% vs. 42%, p = 0.02).Group 3 consisted of 723 male patients and 101 female patients (p < 0.0001). Ischemic cardiomyopathy was the main HF etiology (37.9 %) and it was significantly more often the reason for left ventricular assist device support in men (p = 0.009). No differences were seen in procedural success; 5-year survival showed a better outcome in men (49% vs. 25%, p = 0.026). In patients supported by a VAD, gender has a significant impact on the distribution of diagnoses in the adult population. Women were underrepresented in the age group 13-50 years, and 50 years and older, and women had a higher risk for mortality on VAD support in the adult age groups (groups 2 and 3)."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Sex differences exist in the hypertrophic response, cardiac remodeling, and transition to heart failure of hypertensive patients, and while some of these differences are likely influenced by estrogen, the genetic pathways downstream of estrogen that impact on cardioprotection have yet to be fully elucidated. We have previously shown that the cardioprotective effects of adrenomedullin (AM), an emerging clinical biomarker for cardiovascular disease severity, vary with sex in mouse models. AM signaling during cardiovascular stress is strongly modulated by receptor activity-modifying protein 3 (RAMP3) via its interaction with the G protein-coupled receptor calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR). Like AM, RAMP3 expression is potently regulated by estrogen, and so we sought to determine the consequences of genetic Ramp3 loss on cardiac adaptation to chronic hypertension, with a particular focus on characterizing potential sex differences. We generated and bred RAMP3(-/-) mice to RenTgMK mice that consistently display severe angiotensin II-mediated CV disease and compared CV disease progression in RenTgMK to that of RenTgMK:RAMP3(-/-) offspring. As expected, RAMP3 gene expression was higher in cardiovascular tissues of RenTgMK mice and more strongly up-regulated in female RenTgMK mice relative to wildtype controls. RAMP3 loss did not affect the development of hypertension or the presence and severity of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis in the left ventricle (LV). However, echocardiography revealed that while RenTgMK mice developed concentric cardiac hypertrophy with sustained systolic function, male RenTgMK:RAMP3(-/-) mice showed evidence of LV chamber dilatation and depressed systolic function, suggestive of cardiac decompensation. Consistent with these measures of heart failure, male RenTgMK:RAMP3(-/-) mice had increased cardiac apoptosis and elevated activation of Akt. These phenotypes were not present in female RenTgMK:RAMP3(-/-) mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate a sex-dependant, cardioprotective role of RAMP3 in the setting of chronic hypertension."Heart	Review	"Despite advances in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF) remains a frequent acute and long-term outcome of ischemic heart disease (IHD). In response to acute coronary ischemia, women are relatively protected from apoptosis, and experience less adverse cardiac remodeling than men, frequently resulting in preservation of left ventricular size and ejection fraction. Despite these advantages, women are at increased risk for HF- complicating acute MI when compared with men. However, women with HF retain a survival advantage over men with HF, including a decreased risk of sudden death. Sex-specific treatment of HF has been hindered by historical under-representation of women in clinical trials, though recent work has suggested that women may have a differential response to some therapies such as cardiac resynchronization. This review highlights the sex differences in the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and outcomes of ischemic heart failure and discusses key areas worthy of further investigation."Heart	Clinical	"Increased arterial stiffness and wave reflection have been reported in heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) and in asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, a precursor of HFNEF. It is unclear whether women, who have higher frequency of HFNEF, are more vulnerable than men to the deleterious effects of arterial stiffness on LV diastolic function. We investigated, in a large community-based cohort, whether sex differences exist in the relationship among arterial stiffness, wave reflection, and LV diastolic function. Arterial stiffness and wave reflection were assessed in 983 participants from the Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions study using applanation tonometry. The central pulse pressure/stroke volume index, total arterial compliance, pulse pressure amplification, and augmentation index were used as parameters of arterial stiffness and wave reflection. LV diastolic function was evaluated by 2-dimensional echocardiography and tissue-Doppler imaging. Arterial stiffness and wave reflection were greater in women compared with men, independent of body size and heart rate (all P<0.01), and showed inverse relationships with parameters of diastolic function in both sexes. Further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors attenuated these relationships; however, a higher central pulse pressure/stroke volume index predicted LV diastolic dysfunction in women (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence intervals, 1.03 to 2.30) and men (odds ratio, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 3.39), independent of other risk factors. In conclusion, in our community-based cohort study, higher arterial stiffness was associated with worse LV diastolic function in men and women. Women's higher arterial stiffness, independent of body size, may contribute to their greater susceptibility to develop HFNEF."Heart	Review	"Men and women with heart failure display important differences in clinical characteristics that might affect their responses to pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies. In women, heart failure is associated with a higher frequency of hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopathy and left bundle branch block than in men. Subgroup analyses of data from randomized clinical trials suggest that these differences result in a differential response to heart failure therapies, including a somewhat better response to Î²-blockers, a worse prognosis with digoxin therapy, and a lower survival benefit with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in women. Importantly, female patients with heart failure also derive significantly greater improvements in cardiac volumes from cardiac resynchronization therapy than do male patients, and this treatment is associated with reduced risks of all-cause mortality and heart failure events among women with mild symptoms. These data suggest that sex-related differences might exist in response to both medical and device therapies for patients with heart failure."Heart	Epidemiology	"The burden of patients with heart failure on health care systems is widely recognised, although there have been few attempts to quantify individual patterns of care and differences in health service utilisation related to age, socio-economic factors and the presence of co-morbidities. The aim of this study was to assess the typical profile, trajectory and resource use of a cohort of Australian patients with heart failure using linked population-based, patient-level data.Using hospital separations (Admitted Patient Data Collection) with death registrations (Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages) for the period 2000-2007 we estimated age- and gender-specific rates of index admissions and readmissions, risk factors for hospital readmission, mean length of stay (LOS), median survival and bed-days occupied by patients with heart failure in New South Wales, Australia.We identified 29,161 index admissions for heart failure. Admission rates increased with age, and were higher for males than females for all age groups. Age-standardised rates decreased over time (256.7 to 237.7/100,000 for males and 235.3 to 217.1/100,000 for females from 2002-3 to 2006-7; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0073 adjusted for gender). Readmission rates (any cause) were 27% and 73% at 28-days and one year respectively; readmission rates for heart failure were 11% and 32% respectively. All cause mortality was 10% and 28% at 28 days and one year. Increasing age was associated with more heart failure readmissions, longer LOS and shorter median survival. Increasing age, increasing Charlson comorbidity score and male gender were risk factors for hospital readmission. Cohort members occupied 954,888 hospital bed-days during the study period (any cause); 383,646 bed-days were attributed to heart failure admissions.The rates of index admissions for heart failure decreased significantly in both males and females over the study period. However, the impact on acute care hospital beds was substantial, with heart failure patients occupying almost 200,000 bed-days per year in NSW over the five year study period. The strong age-related trends highlight the importance of stabilising elderly patients before discharge and community-based outreach programs to better manage heart failure and reduce readmissions."Heart	Outcomes	"The purpose of this study was to determine the combined effects of gender and levels of social support on 1-year functional health outcomes in older persons diagnosed with heart failure (HF). Persons â‰¥â€‰65 years of age with an acute HF exacerbation (164 females; 271 males) were enrolled and followed for a year. Participants completed baseline and 12-month questionnaires containing clinical and demographic descriptive information and validated self-report measures of: (1) physical functioning (Medical Outcome Study [MOS] SF12 and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ]) and (2) social support (MOS- Social Support Survey). Women were more likely to be single, widowed or divorced, living alone and earning less annual income. At baseline, women reported significantly lower support and physical function scores. However, at 1 year there were no significant gender differences in the proportion of men or women who experienced clinically meaningful functional decline or death across the year of follow-up. In multivariable modeling, men with lower levels of social support were more likely to experience functional decline. This was not the case for women. Our findings suggest that gender-directed strategies to promote optimization of function for both men and women living with HF in their community are warranted."Heart	Review	"The problem of cardiovascular diseases in women is often neglected. Current guidelines recommend the same treatment for chronic heart failure (HF) in all patients regardless of sex. However, prior studies demonstrated sexâ€‘related differences in many aspects of HF care. Female patients with HF are less likely than men to receive evidenceâ€‘based, guidelineâ€‘recommended treatment; on the other hand, the effect of patient's sex on the administration of treatment is eliminated when the objective reasons for not using these therapies are taken into account. Women with HF are not undertreated in comparison with men when considering objective reasons (this is the cardinal advantage of new HF quality markers). Despite known sex differences, recommendations for HF treatment are the same for women and men because prospective sexâ€‘specific clinical trials have not been conducted. There is an urgent need for further research specifically focused on women with HF."Heart	Management	"This chapter outlines sex differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the most frequently used drugs in cardiovascular diseases, e.g., coronary artery disease, hypertension, heart failure. Retrospective analysis of previously published drug trials revealed marked sex differences in efficacy and adverse effects in a number of cardiovascular drugs. This includes a higher mortality among women taking digoxin for heart failure, more torsade de pointes arrhythmia in QT prolonging drugs and more cough with ACE inhibitors. Trends towards a greater benefit for women and/or female animals have been observed in some studies for endothelin receptor antagonists, the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the ACE-inhibitor ramipril and the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone. However, reproduction of these results in independent studies and solid statistical evidence is still lacking. Some drugs require a particularly careful dose adaptation in women: the beta-blocker metoprolol, the calcium channel blocker verapamil, loop-, and thiazide diuretics. In conclusion, sex differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have to be taken into account for cardiovascular drug therapy in women."Heart	Management	"Several drugs, including Î²-blockers (Î²-adrenoceptor antagonists), are largely under-utilized in older patients with cardiovascular disease.The aims of this study were to evaluate whether older patients (aged â‰¥65 years) with coronary artery disease (CAD) have a different pattern of use of Î²-blockers than younger adult patients (aged <65 years) and whether gender differences or other clinical variables may influence the use of these drugs.Over 6 months, 2226 outpatients with stable CAD were enrolled in an observational, cross-sectional, multicentre survey. Of these, 1416 patients aged â‰¥65 years were grouped into four subgroups according to age. Predictors of Î²-blocker use were determined using logistic regression analyses. Comparisons between younger adults and older patients were conducted using Student's t-tests and chi-squared (Ï‡2) tests.Up to 47% of older patients were not receiving Î²-blockers, and this percentage progressively increased with age, with the oldest patients showing the lowest rate of utilization. No gender difference in the pattern of use of Î²-blockers was noted. The prescription of Î²-blockers was higher in patients with heart failure (HF) than in patients without HF. The presence of HF abolished the decrease in Î²-blocker use with age. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that lower age and severe HF were independent predictors of Î²-blocker use in older people.Age appears to be a key factor in the under-prescription of Î²-blockers in CAD outpatients. Despite the recommendations, and the efforts of cardiologists, the use of Î²-blockers in the elderly is still limited, possibly because of practical constraints such as adverse effects and co-morbidity. In patients with HF, age is less important in determining the use of Î²-blockers."Heart	Outcomes	"Lipid accumulation product (LAP) is an emerging cardiovascular risk factor, which is calculated from waist circumference (WC) and triglyceride (TG) levels. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between LAP and cardiovascular mortality as well as the presence of type 2 diabetes with respect to gender-specific differences. We determined WC and fasting TG levels and the cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus in 2,279 men and 875 postmenopausal women who were routinely referred to coronary angiography. The LAP was calculated as (WC (cm)--65) Ã— (TG (mmol/l)) for men and as (WC (cm)--58) Ã— (TG (mmol/l)) for women. LAP levels were independently associated with congestive heart failure mortality in all postmenopausal women and with all-cause mortality in diabetic postmenopausal women but not in men. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for all-cause, cardiovascular, and congestive heart failure mortality in the third compared to the first LAP tertile were 4.28 (1.94-9.44; P < 0.001), 3.47 (1.28-9.40; P = 0.015), and 10.77 (1.21-95.88; P = 0.033), respectively, in normal weight postmenopausal women, whereas no significant associations were found in men. LAP levels were highly associated with type 2 diabetes in all subjects, postmenopausal women, and men. High LAP values are predictive of mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors in normal weight and diabetic postmenopausal women but not in men. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) was highly associated with LAP in women and men. Our study validates an inexpensive and simple risk profiling that may allow identifying postmenopausal women at high cardiovascular risk."Heart	Review	"The Japanese Circulation Society (JCS) first published guidelines for the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) in 2000 and published revised guidelines in 2005. A great deal of progress has been made in the development of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for CHF in the world. In addition, various data from Japanese clinical trials have been accumulated since first publication. Accordingly, JCS determined to reassess and update guidelines in 2010. Experts in the subject are selected from 13 Japanese organizations including JCS. The guideline recommendations are based on the data from clinical trials and are intended to assist healthcare providers in clinical decision making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches for the diagnosis and management of CHF. The guideline recommendations regarding as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), cardiac rehabilitation, and waon therapy are newly added. Moreover, the effect of gender differences is taken into account in the pharmacologic treatment. Guidelines will be updated with advances in future."Heart	Outcomes	"The efficacy of quantified Crataegus extract in chronic heart failure (CHF) has been assessed in numerous clinical studies. The present pooled analysis evaluates the impact of baseline severity and gender on objective and patient-reported endpoints and associations between both types of outcomes in patients with early CHF.Available data from 687 individual patients treated with quantified Crataegus extract or placebo in ten studies were pooled. Treatment effects on physiologic outcome parameters and on symptoms were analysed for their association with baseline severity and gender. Changes in symptom scores were investigated with respect to their relation to physiologic outcome parameters. Results were compared with observations in a 3-year cohort study.Physiologic outcome parameters maximal workload (MWL), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and pressure-heart rate product increase (PHRPI) at 50 W ergometric exercise improved more in active treatment than in placebo patients. Magnitude of improvement was independent from baseline for LVEF but increased for MWL and PHRPI with baseline severity. Improvement of typical symptoms like reduced exercise tolerance, exertional dyspnea, weakness, fatigue, and palpitations improved more with active treatment and in patients with more severe symptoms. A weak association between improvements in MWL, PRHP, and symptoms could be demonstrated. Gender differences in treatment effects could be explained by baseline differences. Results of the pooled analysis are in agreement with observations in the cohort study.Crataegus extract treatment effects on physiologic outcomes and typical symptoms were modulated by baseline severity. Taking baseline differences into account, benefits were comparable in male and female patients with impaired exercise-tolerance in early chronic heart-failure."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Preventing Ca(2+)-leak during diastole may provide a means to improve overall cardiac function. The  immunosuppressant FK506-binding protein 12.6 (FKBP12.6) regulates ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2) gating and binds to and inhibits calcineurin (Cn). It is also involved in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF). Here, we investigated the effects of FKBP12.6 over-expression and gender on Ca(2+)-handling proteins (RyR2, SERCA2a/PLB, and NCX), and on pro-(CaMKII, Cn/NFAT) and anti-hypertrophic (GSK3Î²) signalling pathways in a thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) mouse model. Wild type mice (WT) and mice over-expressing FKBP12.6 of both genders underwent TAC or sham-operation (Sham). FKBP12.6 over-expression ameliorated post-TAC survival rates in both genders. Over time, FKBP12.6 over-expression reduced the molecular signature of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and the transition to HF (BNP and Î²-MHC mRNAs) and attenuated Cn/NFAT activation in TAC-males only. The gender difference in pro- and anti-hypertrophic LVH signals was time-dependent: TAC-females exhibited earlier pathological LVH associated with concomitant SERCA2a down-regulation, CaMKII activation, and GSK3Î² inactivation. Both genotypes showed systolic dysfunction, possibly related to down-regulated RyR2, but only FK-TAC-males exhibited preserved diastolic LV function. Although FKBP12.6 over-expression did not impact the vicious cycle of TAC-induced HF, this study reveals some subtle sequential and temporal gender differences in Ca(2+)-signalling pathways of pathological LVH."Heart	Review	"Women are approximately two times more likely than men to develop heart failure in the setting of preserved left ventricular ejection fraction [i.e. heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF)], but the reasons for this disparity are unknown.HFpEF is caused by changes in ventricular-vascular properties that are associated with aging and hypertensive cardiac remodeling. These changes lead to diastolic and systolic dysfunction and impaired reserve capacity. Many of the cardiovascular alterations seen in HFpEF are also noted to greater extent in women compared with men. Women demonstrate more concentric left ventricular remodeling and less ventricular dilatation in response to arterial hypertension. Ventricular and arterial stiffness increases with age in both sexes, but the increase is more dramatic in women. Recently, age-sex interactions have also been observed in the manner in which left ventricular function changes across the lifespan, wherein systolic and diastolic function and functional reserve become more compromised in women as compared with men in the postmenopausal years, despite similar or enhanced function in women during youth.The prevalence of HFpEF is increasing and women outnumber men by a 2â€Š:â€Š1 ratio. Recent data have identified striking parallels between structure-function alterations observed in HFpEF and sex differences in cardiovascular function across the adult lifespan. These data suggest that sex-specific maladaptations to hypertensive aging in women may underlie greater risk of HFpEF."Heart	Epidemiology	"The authors evaluated the prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with heart failure (HF) to determine whether there are racial and sex differences and to determine the number of new cases of hypothyroidism. The study included 194 patients in an HF disease management program (HFDMP) in South Florida. Patients were interviewed for a history of hypothyroidism and referred for measurement of thyrotropin. The prevalence of hypothyroidism was calculated by race and sex. The prevalence of hypothyroidism was 18% for all patients with HF and 23% among Hispanics; however, this trend was not statistically significant (P = .06). More men than women had hypothyroidism (P = .04). Patients with hypothyroidism had higher mean lipid profiles (P < .01) and lower mean heart rates (P = .03) than healthy patients. Hypothyroidism is prevalent among HF patients, especially men. Hispanics with HF may have a higher prevalence of hypothyroidism. The standardized protocol of the HFDMP helped identify new cases of hypothyroidism."Heart	Management	"Aging and gender may affect left ventricular (LV) mechanics. The aim of this study was to determine the age and gender dependency of LV mechanical indices obtained from real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE).RT3DE was performed in 280 healthy subjects (age range, 1-88 years; 137 men). From full-volume data sets, LV endocardial and epicardial borders were semiautomatically traced using quantitative software. LV volumes and corresponding long-axis diameter were measured throughout the cardiac cycle. Sphericity index was defined as the ratio of LV volume and spherical volume, calculated as 4/3 Ã— Ï€ Ã— (long-axis diameter/2)(3). LV mass was calculated as (LV epicardial volume - LV endocardial volume) Ã— 1.05. The ratio of LV mass to LV volume was also calculated.The mean value of LV ejection fraction did not change with age. However, LV volumes, mass, sphericity index, and LV mass/volume ratio were altered by age: (1) sphericity index was highest in the first decade of age and then declined until the fifth decade, (2) LV mass/volume ratio significantly increased in older age, and (3) LV mass/volume ratio was significantly higher in aged women compared with age-matched men.Age has heterogeneous effects on LV shape and LV mass/volume ratio, potentially due to the growing process of myocardial fibers and the surrounding architecture in the younger population, as well as the aging process, with an increase in vascular stiffness and a loss of myocytes in older populations. Higher LV mass/volume ratios in older women might be a contributor to the preferential development of diastolic heart failure in this population."Heart	Clinical	"This study aimed to investigate sex differences in the association between arterial stiffness and left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction.Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is more common in women. Arterial stiffness has been suggested as a significant contributor to the development of heart failure. We hypothesized that the association between arterial stiffness and LV diastolic function would be stronger in women than in men.Two-dimensional, Doppler echocardiography and radial artery tonometry were performed simultaneously in 158 age-matched subjects (79 males, 79 females; mean age: 58 Â± 10 years) without any structural heart disease or LV systolic dysfunction.The peripheral blood pressure and pulse pressure (PP) were similar between sexes. However, central PP and augmentation index were significantly higher and PP amplification was significantly lower in women (1.31 vs. 1.19, p < 0.001). The associations of PP amplification with early diastolic mitral annular (Em) velocity and transmitral to mitral annular early diastolic velocity ratio (E/Em) were significant in women (r = 0.38, p = 0.001; r = -0.36, p = 0.001), whereas no significant association was found in men (r = 0.09, p = 0.428, r = -0.14, p = 0.215). Multiple regression analysis revealed that PP amplification had an independent correlation with Em velocity only in women.Despite similar peripheral PP, the central hemodynamics reflecting arterial stiffness were different between men and women. LV diastolic function correlates significantly with the parameters representing arterial stiffness only in women. We suggest that the effects of earlier wave reflection on central pressure may contribute to greater susceptibility to heart failure with preserved LV ejection fraction in women."Heart	Review	"Heart failure (HF) is an increasing problem for the aging population, specifically among women. The etiology of HF influences both the selection and outcome of the treatment. There are variations between genders in morbidity and mortality in different studies, possibly reflecting etiology. The objective of this study was to examine the strength of evidence available for gender differences in the etiology of chronic heart failure.Computer-assisted searches from 1980-2009 for gender differences in the etiology of heart failure were performed (Medline, EMBASE and PubMed). From 2347 abstracts reviewed based on inclusion criteria, 35 original articles were chosen for review. Data extraction was based on observational studies (prospective/retrospective cohort or cross sectional) with a mean follow up of 3 months. There was no interrater variability between the 2 reviewers on data-extraction.Ventricular systolic dysfunction being more associated with male sex, but female sex was more reported to be associated with preserved left ventricular function. Ischemic etiology and associated coronary heart disease were strongly correlated with male sex. The risk for HF was dramatically more elevated for women with systolic hypertension but the association for diabetes mellitus as the etiology of HF was somewhat equal between males and females.One of the limitations in reaching conclusions about gender differences in cardiovascular disease is that many major clinical trials do not include a gender analysis nor they are powered to do so as women are under-represented in most of the HF studies. The need remains for a well designed prospective study of sufficient numbers of male and female patients with and without heart failure and analyzing etiology and risk factors based on the sex differences."Heart	Review	"Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in men and women worldwide. Men develop most, but not all, cardiovascular diseases at an earlier age while the number of affected women significantly increases with higher age. Heart failure (HF) is a common cause of cardiovascular death and carries a poor prognosis in both genders. Risk factors and myocardial adaptations in HF in men and women are different. Female hearts develop a more favorable physiological form of myocardial remodeling than male hearts. This may be related to sex hormones, estrogens and testosterone. A clinical study for gender differences in human aortic stenosis supports the hypotheses. HF management differs between both sexes, with underdiagnosis and undertreatment and less use of invasive therapies in women. Nevertheless, women frequently have better outcomes than men. Gender research will contribute directly to patient-oriented benefit by suggesting clinical protocols."Heart	Review	"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is well established in the treatment of patients with heart failure, but lacks data addressing sex differences in response. Women with heart failure outnumber men, but have additional comorbidities and typically are older. Women continue to be underrepresented in clinical trials, but examining their response to a therapy across multiple studies could provide significant insight into the treatment effect. The major clinical trials did have a significant percentage of female patients, but present minimal in subgroup analysis. A few small studies comparing the effect of CRT between men and women indicate a more positive effect in women. This early data suggests CRT is at least as effective in women as it is in men, and may have additional benefit in this population."Heart	Clinical	"Clinical outcomes for cardiovascular syndromes such as heart failure differ between men and women.To seek phenotypic evidence for sex-differences in cardiac-specific sympathetic nervous system activation, as abnormal sympathetic nervous system activation is a key pathophysiological mechanism in heart failure (HF).Patients who underwent evaluation of cardiac norepinephrine spillover (CNESP) using radiotracer methodology were identified retrospectively, and included in the analysis if they met criteria for either a normal left ventricular (NLV) function group, or systolic HF group, defined as an LV ejection fraction <40% and NYHA class II-III symptoms. Within each group a matched cohort analysis, identifying two control men for each woman, was performed.166 subjects were identified, 48 within the NLV function group and 118 within the HF group. In the NLV function group, 12 women were matched for age to 24 men. Women had significantly higher NE concentrations in coronary sinus plasma. When normalised to total body NE spillover (CNESP:TBNESP), women had significantly higher values than men (CNESP:TBNESP, 6Â±3% in women vs 3Â±3% in men, p<0.05). In the HF group, 20 women were matched for age, date of study and presence of coronary disease to 39 men. There were no differences in comorbidities, drugs or haemodynamic measurements. Both CNESP and CNESP:TBNESP were significantly higher in women with HF than in men (CNESP 264Â±191 in women vs 182Â±110 in men, CNESP:TBNESP 9Â±6% in women vs 4Â±2% in men, p<0.05 for both).In patients with and without HF, women exhibit increased cardiac-specific sympathetic activation. Sexual dimorphism in cardiac autonomic physiology and its relationship to disease merits further investigation."Heart	REVIEW	"It has been observed that the incidence of heart failure and Brugada syndrome are higher in men, while women are more likely to have QT interval prolongation and develop torsades de pointes (TdP). Over the past decade, new studies have improved our understanding of the mechanisms of abnormal repolarization and the relationship between gender differences in cardiac repolarization and presentation of clinical syndromes. Nevertheless, the causes of gender-based differences in cardiac disease are still not completely clear. This review paper briefly summarized what is currently known about gender differences in heart failure, Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome from molecular mechanisms to clinical presentations."Heart	Clinical	"We assessed gender differences in variables related to B-natriuretic peptide (BNP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), peak oxygen consumption (peak-VO2), and LV mass (LVM), among patients recently hospitalized for suspected heart failure (HF).Of 930 consecutive patients, 409 accepted follow-up after discharge, 221 of these had definite HF (90 women, mean age 74.5 [9.8]years). In 141 HF patients (61 women) with BNP data, women had lower BNP than men (43.9 [38.1] versus 76.3 [88.9]pmol/L, P=0.0193). LVEF (all HF patients) was higher in women (49.8 [13.4] versus 42.4 [13.9]%, P=0.0004). Peak-VO2 (147 HF patients, 48 women) was lower in women (13.9 [4.3] versus 16.3 [4.2]mL/kg/min, P=0.0093). LVM index (200 HF patients, 78 women) was lower in women (130.4 [46.5] versus 171.7 [57.6]g/m(2), P<0.0001). Among HF patients, variables independently related to BNP were body mass index (BMI) and peak-VO2 exclusively among men, mitral regurgitation, respiratory disease and angiotensin receptor blocker treatment only among women. Variables independently related to LVEF were resting heart rate, acetylic salicylic acid use and BNP exclusively among men. No variable was exclusive for women. Variables independently related to peak-VO2 were right ventricular size, BNP, resting and peak heart rate solely among men, BMI and stable angina pectoris exclusively among women. Variables independently related to LVM were left atrial diameter only among men, BMI exclusively among women.Among elderly HF patients, there were some important gender differences in BNP, LVEF, peak-VO2 and LVM, and in variables independently related to these factors."Heart	Outcomes	"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established treatment of patients with heart failure. Several baseline characteristics can influence the CRT outcomes, and little is known about the effect of gender. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the gender-related differences in long-term survival after CRT. A total of 578 consecutive patients with heart failure underwent CRT. At baseline and 6 months after CRT, the clinical and echocardiographic parameters were obtained. All-cause mortality was compared between the men and women. The study population included 431 men (67 Â± 9 years) and 147 women (65 Â± 11 years). No differences in the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics were observed between the men and women, except for left bundle branch block and a nonischemic etiology of heart failure, which were more frequent in women (81% vs 68% and 63% vs 33%, respectively; p <0.01), and atrial fibrillation, which was more prevalent in men (20% vs 10%, respectively; p = 0.01). During a mean follow-up of 34 Â± 25 months, 197 patients died (158 men and 39 women). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant difference in long-term survival between the women and men (p = 0.007). The 2-year all-cause mortality rate was 15% in men and 8% in women (p = 0.025). Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed female gender is an independent predictor of long-term survival, together with heart failure etiology and renal function. In particular, women with heart failure due to a nonischemic etiology showed the best long-term survival rate. In conclusion, female gender and nonischemic etiology were independently associated with better long-term survival after CRT."Heart	Pathophysiology	"G-protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) has been reported to act as a membrane-bound estrogen receptor that is involved in the mediation of non-genomic estradiol signalling. In this study, we demonstrated that male, but not female, GPR30-deficient mice suffer from impaired leftâ€‘ventricular cardiac function. Left ventricles from male mutant mice were enlarged. There were no malformations in the valves or outflow tract of the heart. Both the contractility and relaxation capacity of the left ventricle were reduced, leading to increased leftâ€‘ventricular end-diastolic pressure in GPR30-deficient mice. In conclusion, our data support a role for GPR30 in the gender-specific aspects of heart failure."Heart	Clinical	"Heart failure (HF) is a common medical problem with a high impact on public health. Evidence of gender difference in management of HF is scarce. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the presence of gender difference in management of HF patients admitted to the tertiary care hospital in the Aseer region/Saudi Arabia.A chart review was conducted at Aseer Central Hospital (ACH) on consecutive patients admitted with the primary diagnosis of HF between Jun 2007 and May 2009. Data were collected on clinical and management profiles and analyzed for the presence of gender difference in HF management.A total of 206 male patients and 94 female patients with HF were reviewed. Ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy etiologies were significantly higher in male patients (42.7 vs. 28.7%, P < 0.021) and (13.1% vs. 3.2%, P < 0.008), respectively. Renal failure and atrial fibrillation were significantly higher in female patients with HF (20.2 vs., 5.3% P < 0.001) and (20.2 vs. 10.2%, P < 0.018), respectively. Smoking was significantly higher in male patients (11.7 vs. 0%, P < 0.001). Echocardiography was performed equally for both genders and ejection fraction was significantly higher in female patients (38.2 Â± 16.9% vs. 30.4 Â± 16.6%, P < 0.001). Beta-blockers were prescribed significantly less to female patients (36.2 vs. 57.8%, P < 0.001), while ACE inhibitors and digoxin were prescribed significantly less to male patients (64.1 vs.75.5%, P < 0.049) and (24.8 vs. 36.2%, P < 0.042), respectively.Gender differences were detected in clinical presentation and management of HF. Female patients with HF had less ischemic etiology and smoking, but more atrial fibrillation and renal dysfunction. Female patients were under-treated by Beta-blockers while male patients were under-treated by ACE inhibitors and digoxin. Both genders were investigated equally, and female patients had a better ejection fraction."Heart	Clinical	"Recent studies have suggested differences in outcome and treatment between men and women with heart failure. The aim of this study was to see if there were gender differences in the treatment and outcome in real life heart failure patients.Norwegian Heart Failure Registry was used. Three-thousand-six-hundred-and-thirty-two patients (men, n = 2545 (70%), women, n = 1087 (30%)) were included in the study from January 2000 to February 2006. Patients were followed up until death or December 31 2006. The cohort was split into patients with an ejection fraction (EF) less and above 50% and genders were then compared.In the group with EF â‰¥ 50% the only difference between basic characteristics was that men had a lower heart rate. In the group with an EF<50% women were older, had a higher heart rate, had less often atrial fibrillation, were less often smokers and had a more severe NYHA-classification compared to men. More men used statins and warfarin and coronary heart disease (CHD) was more common as the underlying cause of heart failure among men compared to women. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis there was no significant difference between men and women concerning survival.There are differences in basic characteristics, medical history and treatment between men and women in the Norwegian Heart Failure Registry. The survival rates were equal between men and women in this group of real life patients with heart failure."Heart	Epidemiology	"To investigate temporal trends in the risk of heart failure (HF) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to determine whether these trends differ by gender or age.The national Swedish hospital discharge and death registries from 1993 to 2004 were used to calculate age- and gender-specific trends for a first episode of HF within 3 years in 175 216 patients aged 35-84 and hospitalized with a first AMI. Overall, 14.4% of patients aged 35-64 and 31.5% of those aged 65-84 with AMI in 1993-1995 had a hospital diagnosis of HF within 3 years (including the index admission). Corresponding figures for patients with AMI from 2002 to 2004 were 11.5 and 28.0%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, the risk of HF decreased by 4% per year. Having had a stroke before admission increased HF risk by 37%, diabetes increased the risk by 76% and atrial fibrillation by 80%. Patients with any kind of valvular disease had a more than doubled risk. Women had a 6% higher incidence of HF than men, whereas men with an index admission for AMI who did not develop HF had higher mortality than women.In this national sample, we observed a steady decrease in the risk of being hospitalized with HF after an AMI. However, the 3-year risk of HF remains high, with nearly one-third of AMI patients aged 65-84 developing HF within 3 years."Heart	Epidemiology	"To assess heart failure prevalence, epidemiology, co-morbidities and polypharmacy in our region from electronic patient records. To evaluate gender differences in heart failure patients.Descriptive, cross-sectional study.Primary care Lleida (Spain).All patients from 21 primary care centers with the diagnosis of heart failure in medical records were included.Demographic data, comorbidities and therapeutical subgroups in patients with a diagnosis of heart failure in their clinical record.Heart failure was found in 0.99% (3017 from 306229 patients), of whom 59% were women, and a mean age of 80 years. Comorbidities: hypertension 67%, diabetes 30%, hyperlipidemia 26.5%, obesity 27%, ischemic heart disease 19%, stroke 11%, atrial fibrillation 31%, COPD 26%, renal failure 12%. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity were more frequent in women, COPD, ischemic heart disease and renal failure in men. There were no differences in diabetes, stroke and atrial fibrillation. Patients were prescribed a median of 8 different therapeutic subgroups (P25=6 and P75=11). Women were more frequently prescribed diuretics (76%), cardiac glycosides (22%) and ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and men ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor antagonists in combination with beta-blockers.Heart failure patients in primary care are elderly, with significant co-morbidities and treated with a high number of drugs. Gender differences exist in cardiovascular risk factors, co-morbidities, and also in therapy."Heart	Review	"It is increasingly known that gender differences affect disease presentation, clinical pathways, diagnostic yield and prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disorders. There are novel insights regarding heart failure that provide a platform for personalized medicine. This is a review of the existent data about heart failure in women, a neglected topic that has gained considerable interest in the past years. Heart failure in women differs in many aspects from that of men. Part of the difference is attributable to age, ventricular function and cause of heart failure, with women being generally older at heart failure onset, more often without left ventricular systolic dysfunction and less often having heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease, in comparison with men. Elucidation of the genetic and pathophysiological basis of sex differences, together with clinical trials designed to study the impact of treatments in women, could lead to sex based heart failure management."Heart	Epidemiology	"Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a major risk factor for death in end-stage kidney disease; however, data on prevalence and survival trends are limited. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and mortality effect of CHF in successive incident dialysis cohorts.This was a population-based cohort of incident US dialysis patients (n = 926,298) from 1995 to 2005. Age- and gender-specific prevalence of CHF was determined by incident year, whereas temporal trends in mortality were compared using multivariable Cox regression.The prevalence of CHF was significantly higher in women than men and in older than younger patients, but it did not change over time in men (range 28% to 33%) or women (range 33% to 36%). From 1995 to 2005, incident death rates decreased for younger men (â‰¤70 years) and increased for older men (>70 years). For women, the pattern was similar but less impressive. During this period, the adjusted mortality risks (relative risk [RR]) from CHF decreased in men (from RR = 1.06 95% Confidence intervals (CI) 1.02-1.11 in 1995 to 0.91 95% CI 0.87-0.96 in 2005) and women (from RR = 1.06 95% CI 1.01-1.10 in 1995 to 0.90 95% CI 0.85-0.95 in 2005 compared with referent year 2000; RR = 1.00). The reduction in mortality over time was greater for younger than older patients (20% to 30% versus 5% to 10% decrease per decade).Although CHF remains a common condition at dialysis initiation, mortality risks in US patients have declined from 1995 to 2005."Heart	Review	"It has become apparent over the past few decades that several factors can determine lethal or sublethal alterations of cardiovascular system cell function such as inflammatory reaction products, peptides and hormones. In turn, the loss of cellular components from the blood vessels wall and the heart tissue contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Hence, in the recent years, the efforts of several research groups have specifically been devoted to deeply investigate the implication of the main forms of cell injury, necrosis, apoptosis and autophagy, in the development of cardiac and blood vessel alterations associated with human diseases. Furthermore, several lines of evidence demonstrate that CVD clearly display significant gender differences in terms of onset, progression and outcome. Cardiovascular cells contain functional estrogen and androgen receptors and are targets for sex hormone action, which can influence many physiological and pathological processes, including vascular and myocardial cell homeostasis. However, hormones are important but not unique actors in this issue, further genetic and epigenetic determinants being involved. This review focuses on recent studies on the effects of gender differences, including sex hormones, on cardiac and vascular cell injury and death and their influence in determining atherosclerosis, heart failure and other main human CVD."Heart	Review	"Heart failure (HF) represents a growing health issue with significant morbidity, expense, and mortality in western world. Despite a similar prevalence between gender our knowledge about this disease mostly come from studies performed in men. Instead, until now women have been under-represented in HF trials and this limits our knowledge of HF in women to extrapolation of findings from men. However according to the available data women with HF differ from men regarding pathophysiology, clinical presentation and prognosis. Women with HF often present at an older age, have a better systolic function, suffer from more comorbidities, have an higher rate of hospital admissions and have a better age-adjusted survival compared to men. Moreover pharmacodynamic specificities related to gender have been described. Taken together these gender-related differences can affect response to several kinds of treatments and the general clinical approach to the patient by the physician. The understanding of these differences may improve the clinical management of HF and possible new gender-specific diagnostic and therapeutic options may be developed. To this aim, it remains mandatory. to increase the number of female patients with HF enrolled in clinical trials."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Men are at an increased risk of dying from heart failure caused by inflammatory heart diseases such as atherosclerosis, myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We previously showed that macrophages in the spleen are phenotypically distinct in male compared to female mice at 12 h after infection. This innate immune profile mirrors and predicts the cardiac immune response during acute myocarditis.In order to study sex differences in the innate immune response, five male and female BALB/c mice were infected intraperitoneally with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) or phosphate buffered saline and their spleens were harvested 12 h later for microarray analysis. Gene expression was determined using an Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. Significant gene changes were verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or ELISA.During the innate immune response to CVB3 infection, infected males had higher splenic expression of genes which are important in regulating the influx of cholesterol into macrophages, such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and the macrophage scavenger receptor compared to the infected females. We also observed a higher expression in infected males compared to infected females of squalene synthase, an enzyme used to generate cholesterol within cells, and Cyp2e1, an enzyme important in metabolizing cholesterol and steroids. Infected males also had decreased levels of the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), which binds PLA2 and is the rate-limiting step for steroidogenesis, as well as decreased expression of the androgen receptor (AR), which indicates receptor activation. Gene differences were not due to increased viral replication, which was unaltered between sexes.We found that, compared to females, male mice had a greater splenic expression of genes which are important for cholesterol metabolism and activation of the AR at 12 h after infection. Activation of the AR has been linked to increased cardiac hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, myocarditis/DCM and heart failure in male mice and humans."Heart	Review	"Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disabling condition characterized by PA vasoconstriction and remodeling as well as in situ thrombosis and eventual right heart failure. Idiopathic PAH occurs more frequently in females than in males. The female:male ratio is 1.64 âˆ¼ 3.88:1. Although endogenous sex hormones including estrogen have been suggested to account for the observed gender differences in PAH, a precise pathobiology for the gender differences remains uncertain. Recent studies demonstrated that estrogen exerts beneficial effects on the pulmonary vasculature. However, it seems to contradict the female predominance that is observed in idiopathic PAH. Moreover, Sweeney and Voelkel (Sweeney L and Voelkel NF. Eur J Med Res 14: 433-442, 2009) showed that early and long-term estrogen exposure might be correlated with an increased risk of the development of PAH. Here we ask the question: Is estrogen a friend or a foe? According to accumulating evidence, we postulate that the different effects of estrogens on different target cells could account for this paradox, i.e., estrogens may exert beneficial effects only on the increased muscularization of vessel walls, but not on phenotypically altered endothelial cells. The effects of estrogens on the pulmonary vasculature are potent and complex, yet not fully understood. A better mechanistic understanding may allow for future therapeutic interventions in patients with PAH."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Soluble ST2 (sST2) is a protein in the interleukin-1 receptor family secreted by myocytes in response to mechanical strain. Elevated sST2 is strongly prognostic in patients with heart failure.sST2 was measured using the Presage ST2 ELISA. Evaluation included imprecision, linearity, recovery, analytical sensitivity, limit of quantification, stability, and sample type comparisons. Gender-specific reference intervals were established from 245 male and 245 female serum specimens.At sST2 concentrations of 11.6, 26.9, and 88.0 ng/mL, the within-day CV was 7.6, 2.4, and 3.8%, respectively and the total CV was 11.5, 14.0, and 6.3%, respectively. The assay was linear over a concentration range of 2.8-161.1 ng/mL (y=0.95x+2.25; R(2)=0.997; Sy.x=3.03). The limit of quantification was 3.3 ng/mL. sST2 was stable for 2 days at room temperature, 10days at 4 Â°C, and 30 days at -20 Â°C. Concentrations of sST2 were significantly higher in males compared to females (24.9 vs. 16.9 ng/mL; p<0.0001) but were not correlated by age in either gender (r=-0.07; p=0.14). Reference intervals for sST2 were determined to be 8.6-49.3 and 7.2-33.5 ng/mL for males and females, respectively.The Presage ST2 ELISA had acceptable performance characteristics for quantifying sST2 in serum or plasma. The assay is precise and linear over a wide sST2 concentration range and can measure low sST2 concentrations. Concentrations of sST2 are unaffected by age but are higher in males compared to females."Heart	Pathophysiology	"We sought to test the hypothesis that inherent biological factors contribute to gender differences in disease pathophysiology of new-onset heart failure (HF), which can be detected from the transcriptome of a single endomyocardial biopsy (EMB).We analysed samples from male (n = 29) and female patients (n = 14) with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) and new-onset HF with U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix) and significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). There were 35 overexpressed and 16 downregulated transcripts in men vs. women [q < 5%, fold change (FC) > 1.2]. In addition to overexpression of Y-chromosome-related transcripts (n = 18), such as USP9Y (FC > 13.1), DDX3Y (FC > 11.3), RPS4Y1 (FC > 9.9), and EIF1AY (FC > 11.8) in males, there was overexpression of CD24 (FC > 5.6) and KCNK1 (FC > 1.5). In females, XIST was highly overexpressed (FC > 28.9), together with X-linked zinc finger proteins (FC > 1.9) and autosomal genes GATAD1 (FC > 1.6), SLC2A12 (FC > 2.9), and PDE6B (FC > 1.5). Analysis of a public data set of end-stage IDCM (n = 15) resulted in approximately 85% overlap with our findings.This is the first study that identified gender-specific transcriptomic differences in new-onset HF. Our findings may offer novel insights into fundamental biological differences in the pathophysiology of HF between sexes and provide a platform for personalized medicine."Heart	Management	"Knowledge about the potential burden for family caregivers related to the care of patients with heart failure (HF) is limited. The aims of the study were to compare the kind and amount of care provided by partners of HF patients and partners of healthy individuals and to examine the associations between gender and the performance of caregiving tasks.Caregiving tasks performed by 338 partners of HF patients were compared with those performed by 1202 partners of healthy individuals. Partners (age 70 +/- 9, 76% female) of HF patients were more likely to provide personal care compared with partners (age 65 +/- 7, 66% female) of healthy individuals after controlling for their age. However, the magnitude of the odds ratios (OR) differed by gender of partners (OR for male 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9-11.4; OR for female 3.7; 95% CI 2.7-5.1). Partners of HF patients were more likely to provide emotional care than partners of healthy individuals, controlling for age and gender (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.5-3.6). Male partners of HF patients were more likely to provide personal care compared to female partners of HF patients (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1-3.2).The care performed by partners of HF patients is above and beyond normal spousal assistance. The study underscores the crucial role of family caregivers in the care of HF patients and encourages health care providers to address the needs of both HF patients and their caregivers."Heart	Review	"Prior studies demonstrated sex-related differences in many aspects of chronic heart failure (HF), and in the appropriate use, individual response or complication rates with non-pharmacological treatment, too. There is seasonal variability in morbidity and mortality of HF with significant gender differences, partially due to respiratory diseases, which may be potentionally preventable by vaccination. Quitting smoking is associated with substantial decrease in morbidity and mortality in HF patients which is similar in magnitude to the effect of an appropriate beta-blocker use. Yet little emphasis has been placed on smoking cessation strategies in women with HF and should be adopted as vigorously as proven medical therapy. Complications of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation were more frequent in females. Gender disparity exists in the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy, although they are beneficial for both women and men. Smaller women have limited access to left ventricular assist device (LVAD) because these devices require a minimum body surface to fit properly. Women were more likely than men to develop severe right ventricular failure after implantation of LVAD. Lower cut-off level of peak oxygen consumption was suggested for women to determine optimal timing for heart transplantation. Disease management programs probably narrows gender differences in quality of care and survival among HF patients. Women with HF have less access to cardiologists, although this consultation is associated with better quality of care, particularly for women. Despite these known sex differences, recommendations for HF are the same for women and men, because prospective sex-specific clinical trials have not been performed."Heart	Clinical	"Clinical characteristics, including risk factors for thromboembolism, and medications differ between men and women with atrial fibrillation (AF) in Western countries. Whether such a difference exists for Japanese patients with AF is unclear, so data from J-TRACE were used to investigate this issue.A total of 2,892 patients (2,028 men, 864 women; 70.3 years old) with AF were analyzed for the respective prevalences of risk factors and medications. CHADS2 score was calculated to determine thromboembolic risk level. Women were older (P<0.001), and more frequently had heart failure (P<0.001), and hypertension (P=0.051) than men. The proportion of subjects aged 75 years or older was higher among women than among men (P<0.001). CHADS2 score was therefore significantly higher in women than in men (2.05+/-1.29 vs 1.88+/-1.33, P<0.001). Sex-related differences were not observed for the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, nor did warfarin usage differ between men and women.Sex-related differences were observed in the risk factor profile and medications of Japanese patients with AF. CHADS2 score was higher in women than in men."Heart	Review	"Sex has a profound impact on myocardial remodeling, which is defined as the molecular and cellular events after an injury to the myocardium (i.e., necrosis, pressure overload, volume overload, and aging) leading to a change in shape, dimension, and function of cardiac chambers. Indeed, experimental studies and post-mortem and observational clinical studies suggest the presence of important differences in myocardial remodeling between females and males in response to different types of injures including aging, pressure and volume overload, and myocardial infarction. Interestingly, the remodeling process appears to be more favorable in women versus men; women are more likely to present heart failure with preserved systolic function and are at greater risk for low output syndrome acutely. These differences between men and women are widely held to be related to sex hormones such as estrogen, although the molecular effects of estrogen on ventricular cardiomyocytes are incompletely understood. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting these notions and discuss the underlying mechanisms and the clinical implications."Heart	Review	"This article addresses the various aspects concerning gender dissimilarities in the cardiovascular system. It examines sex differences in the genetic susceptibility to cardiovascular disease (CVD) development or outcome: with the presence of either XX or XY chromosomes, every cell is sexually differentiated and there exist postpuberal differences between male and female cardiovascular systems. The main action mechanisms of sex steroid hormones are discussed, mainly as to testosterone (Te) in men and 17beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (Pro) in women. In women, susceptibility to CVD is known to increase in the postmenopausal period, when the ovarian hormone function expires. Some concepts of the sex-based differences in anatomy and physiology are also explained. Although they have the same structural elements, women and men use them in a different way to guarantee cardiovascular system homeostasis. Some examples of differences between men and women in pathological cardiovascular function are given. A further important issue regards the prevalence and role of cardiovascular risk factors in the two genders. Compared to boys of the same age, adolescent girls and premenopausal women have a more favorable risk profile: lower blood pressure (BP), less atherogenic lipid profile, and lower prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Women develop CVD later than men and diabetic women have a considerably higher mortality rate compared to men of the same age. Finally, there exist several clinically significant differences between men and women as to prevalence, presentation, management and outcome of CVD. Clinical peculiarities related to gender in presentation of some CVDs, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and heart failure, are described. We are absolutely convinced that only an accurate knowledge of the sex-specific pathophysiology may allow determination of the appropriate diagnostic instruments and to implement tailored treatments of CVD in men and women."Heart	Epidemiology	"Controlled clinical trials have defined the characteristics of specialized world populations, different from the real world population. On this basis, the GIPSI registry was created, aiming to collect data from heart failure populations managed by general practitioners, focusing on gender differences.The registry was based on family history, clinical and laboratory data collection from general practitioners. Patients were considered as being at risk for heart failure if data applied to stage A/B, or presenting overt heart failure if data applied to stage C/D of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification.From June 2006 to October 2007, 757 consecutive patients (475 male, 62.7%) were enrolled from 260 general practitioner's practices; 227 patients (143 male, 63.0%) had overt heart failure. In the female population at risk, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were observed, whereas males showed more frequently ischemic heart disease, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and were more often prescribed with statins and antiplatelet drugs. There were more heart failure females with diabetes and of advanced age. Moreover, females showed a higher pulse pressure and a significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (by simplified MDRD equation) than males.The data collected in a real world population show that heart failure has significantly different gender characteristics, especially for risk factors, age, blood pressure and renal function. This kind of investigation should be extended to larger patient populations for a better understanding of the disease."Heart	Pathophysiology	"We investigated sex differences and the role of estrogen receptor-beta (ERbeta) on myocardial hypertrophy in a mouse model of pressure overload. We performed transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham surgery in male and female wild-type (WT) and ERbeta knockout (ERbeta(-/-)) mice. All mice were characterized by echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements and were killed 9 wk after surgery. Left ventricular (LV) samples were analyzed by microarray profiling, real-time RT-PCR, and histology. After 9 wk, WT males showed more hypertrophy and heart failure signs than WT females. Notably, WT females developed a concentric form of hypertrophy, while males developed eccentric hypertrophy. ERbeta deletion augmented the TAC-induced increase in cardiomyocyte diameter in both sexes. Gene expression profiling revealed that WT male hearts had a stronger induction of matrix-related genes and a stronger repression of mitochondrial genes than WT female hearts. ERbeta(-/-) mice exhibited a different transcriptional response. ERbeta(-/-)/TAC mice of both sexes exhibited induction of proapoptotic genes with a stronger expression in ERbeta(-/-) males. Cardiac fibrosis was more pronounced in male WT/TAC than in female mice. This difference was abolished in ERbeta(-/-) mice. The number of apoptotic nuclei was increased in both sexes of ERbeta(-/-)/TAC mice, most prominent in males. Female sex offers protection against ventricular chamber dilation in the TAC model. Both female sex and ERbeta attenuate the development of fibrosis and apoptosis, thus slowing the progression to heart failure."Heart	Epidemiology	"Because patients with heart failure (HF) experience multiple symptoms simultaneously, it is necessary to explore symptom clusters rather than individual symptoms to determine their impact on outcomes. Given gender differences in symptom experience, examination of potential gender differences in clusters is reasonable.The objective of the study was to compare symptom clusters between men and women with HF, differences in patient characteristics among symptom clusters, and the impact of symptom clusters on cardiac event-free survival.A total of 331 patients with HF recruited from HF clinics were included (35% were female and 62% were of New York Heart Association classes III/IV). Cluster analysis was used to identify symptom clusters between men and women based on ratings of distress related to 7 symptoms. Analysis of variance or chi test was used to compare characteristics of patient groups that were divided by the median split of total distress scores of each cluster. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine whether total scores of symptom distress in symptom clusters predicted time to first cardiac event.Two identical symptom clusters were identified in men and women: a physical symptom cluster composed of dyspnea, fatigue/increased need to rest, fatigue/low energy, and sleep disturbances and an emotional/cognitive symptom cluster composed of worrying, feeling depressed, and cognitive problems. Patients with higher distress from the physical symptom cluster were primarily females and of New York Heart Association classes III and IV (P < .05). Patients with higher distress from the emotional/cognitive symptom cluster were younger than those with lower distress (P < .05). The total symptom distress score in the emotional/cognitive cluster, but not the physical cluster, was an independent predictor of cardiac event-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.37).Although distress for individual symptoms may differ between men and women, they both experienced identical symptom clusters. Only the emotional/cognitive cluster predicted a higher risk for a cardiac event. These results suggested that interventions should be developed that consider symptom clusters. Targeting patients who have high distress from emotional/cognitive symptoms may be particularly important as they may be most vulnerable for adverse outcomes."Heart	Management	"Although approximately half of adults with heart failure (HF) are women, relatively little is known about gender differences and similarities in HF self-care.The aim of this study was to describe HF self-care in men and women and to identify gender-specific barriers and facilitators influencing HF self-care.A total of 27 adults (8 women) with chronic HF participated in a cross-sectional, comparative mixed methods study. An analysis of in-depth interviews was used to describe gender-specific barriers and facilitators of self-care. After the interview data were analyzed, the results were confirmed in quantitative data obtained from the same sample and at the same time. Concordance between qualitative and quantitative data was assessed.There were no consistent gender-specific differences in self-care practices but there were distinct gender differences in the decisions made in interpreting and responding to symptoms. The men were better than the women at interpreting their symptoms as being related to HF and in initiating treatment. These differences were associated with differences in self-care confidence, social support, and mood.Gender-specific differences in self-care behaviors are minimal. However, gender-specific barriers and facilitators greatly influence the choice of self-care behaviors."Heart	Review	"Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the Western world. It affects men at younger age than women. Women have more frequently diastolic HF, associated with the major risk factors of diabetes and hypertension and men have more frequently systolic HF because of coronary artery disease. Under stress, male hearts develop more easily pathological hypertrophy with dilatation and poor systolic function than female hearts. Women with aortic stenosis have more concentric hypertrophy with better systolic function, less upregulation of extracellular matrix genes and better reversibility after unloading. Stressed female hearts maintain energy metabolism better than male hearts and are better protected against calcium overload. Estrogens and androgens and their receptors are present in the myocardium and lead to coordinated regulation of functionally relevant pathways. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a more ominous sign in women than in men. Men with end-stage cardiomyopathy more frequently have auto-antibodies than women. Women receive less guideline-based diagnostics and therapy. Expensive and invasive therapies such as advanced pacemakers and transplantation are underused in women. Drug studies point at sex differences in efficacy. Despite worse diagnostics and therapy, prognosis is better in women than in men."Heart	Clinical	"To evaluate the association of anaemia with increased long-term morbidity and mortality in hospitalised heart failure (HF) patients.We analysed medical records of a random sample of 1000 patients admitted to tertiary care hospitals from 1996 to 2006 with a principal diagnosis of HF. Anaemia (WHO criteria) on admission was present in 45.2% of HF patients. Multivariate analysis identified anaemia as an independent predictor of 5-year mortality with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.44 (95%CI 1.20-1.73) compared to non-anaemic patients, and a rate ratio of 1.85 (95%CI 1.72-2.02) for unplanned all-cause readmission and 1.22 (95%CI 1.16-1.29) for HF readmission within 5 years. Compared to patients in the highest gender-specific Hb quartile, those with mild anaemia (Hb 11.3-13.0 g/dL in males, 11.0-12.4 g/dL in females) had an adjusted HR of 1.32 (95%CI 1.01-1.71) for 5-year mortality. Anaemia and chronic kidney disease were independent (additive) predictors of survival, whereas anaemia interacted with prevalent diabetes (p for interaction=0.006), such that patients with both conditions had an adjusted mortality HR of 2.18 (95%CI 1.48-3.22) compared to those with diabetes only.Mild anaemia is common in hospitalised HF patients and is an independent predictor of 5-year all-cause mortality in HF."Heart	Pathophysiology	"The prevalence of cardiovascular disease is lower in middle-aged and older women than men. Increased endothelin-1-mediated vasoconstriction has been linked to the etiology of a number of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, heart failure, and hypertension. It is unknown whether a sex difference in endothelin-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone exists in middle-aged and older adults. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that middle-aged and older men would demonstrate greater ET-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone than age-matched women. Forearm blood flow in response to intra-arterial infusions of endothelin (ET)-1, BQ-123 (a selective ET(A) receptor antagonist), and BQ-788 (a selective ET(B) receptor antagonist) was assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography in 21 women (age: 58 + or - 1 yr; body mass index: 26.0 + or - 1.0 kg/m(2)) and 25 men (age: 57 + or - 2 yr; body mass index: 26.8 + or - 0.7 kg/m(2)). In response to BQ-123, the increase in forearm blood flow from baseline was significantly higher in the men than the women (24 + or - 5% vs. 9 + or - 5%; P < 0.05). In contrast, the increase in forearm blood flow in response to BQ-123 coinfused with BQ-788 was greater in the women than the men, such that the maximum vasodilation to dual endothelin receptor blockade was similar between men and women (approximately 25%). There was no difference in the vasoconstrictor response to ET-1 between the sexes. These results indicate that middle-aged and older men are under greater ET(A) receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor tone than age-matched women. Since the ET(A) receptor is the predominant receptor subtype in the coronary vasculature, this sex difference in vasoconstrictor tone may be a mechanism contributing to the sex difference in the prevalence of coronary heart disease in middle-aged and older adults."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Little is known about sex-dependent physiological and pathophysiological differences in cardiac endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and activation. Therefore, we investigated cardiac morphology and eNOS protein expression, including its translocation-dependent activation and phosphorylation, in cardiac tissue of male and female wild-type mice and transgenic heart-failure mice having a cardiac-specific, 5-fold overexpression of the Galphaq protein. In addition, we measured calcineurin protein expression. Heart-to-body weight ratio was increased in Galphaq mice. Female wild-type mice showed higher eNOS protein expression and activation (translocation and phosphorylation) than did wild-type males. In cardiac tissue of Galphaq mice, these sex-dependent differences remained or were enhanced. Protein expression of the catalytic subunit calcineurin A, which has been shown to dephosphorylate eNOS, was higher in wild-type males than in wild-type females. These differences were increased in the Galphaq mice model. We conclude that sex differences exist in cardiac eNOS protein expression and phosphorylation. Increased activation of the Galphaq protein appears to alter eNOS protein expression and phosphorylation only in males."Heart	Clinical	"Patients hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation are usually of advanced age, with functional deterioration, and suffering an increased number of associated conditions, but little is known about gender differences. Our hypothesis is that the frequency and type of comorbidities differ in male and female COPD patients.A cross-sectional, multicentre study of patients hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation. All of them had COPD confirmed by baseline forced spirometry with a bronchodilator test. Comorbidity information was collected using the Charlson index, and an ad hoc questionnaire that included other common conditions not included in the Charlson index.We studied 398 patients, 353 men (89%) and 45 women (11%), with a mean (S.D.) age of 73.7 (8.9) years and a percent predicted FEV(1) of 43.2 (12.5). The mean score of the Charlson index was 2.7 (2.0), with no differences by gender; in contrast, the mean number of all comorbid conditions assessed was 3.7 (1.7) in men and 1.8 (1.8) in women (p < 0.05). Overall, 55% of the patients had arterial hypertension, 26% diabetes mellitus, 27% chronic heart failure, and 17% ischemic heart disease. Female COPD patients had a lower prevalence of ischemic heart disease (p = 0.008) and alcoholism (p = 0.03), but presented more frequently with chronic heart failure (p = 0.03), osteoporosis (p = 0.007) and diabetes mellitus without complications (p = 0.02).Comorbidities are common in patients hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation, but their relative distribution varies by gender. The exclusive use of the Charlson index underestimates comorbidities in COPD patients."Heart	Pathophysiology	"We have previously reported gender differences in ventricular remodeling and development of heart failure using the aortocaval fistula model of chronic volume overload in rats. In contrast to males, female rats exhibited no adverse ventricular remodeling and less mortality in response to volume overload. This gender-specific cardioprotection was lost following ovariectomy and was partially restored using estrogen replacement. However, it is not known if estrogen treatment would be as effective in males. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the structural and functional effects of estrogen in male rats subjected to chronic volume overload. Four groups of male rats were studied at 3 days and 8 wk postsurgery as follows: fistula and sham-operated controls, with and without estrogen treatment. Biochemical and histological studies were performed at 3 days postsurgery, with chronic structural and functional effects studied at 8 wk. Measurement of systolic and diastolic pressure-volume relationships was obtained using a blood-perfused isolated heart preparation. Both fistula groups developed significant ventricular hypertrophy after 8 wk of volume overload. Untreated rats with fistula exhibited extensive ventricular dilatation, which was coupled with a loss of systolic function. Estrogen attenuated left ventricular dilatation and maintained function in treated rats. Estrogen treatment was also associated with a reduction in oxidative stress and circulating endothelin-1 levels, as well as prevention of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 activation and breakdown of ventricular collagen in the early stage of remodeling. These data demonstrate that estrogen attenuates ventricular remodeling and disease progression in male rats subjected to chronic volume overload."Heart	Outcomes	"Data on racial and gender differences in mortality in patients followed in a standardized heart failure disease management program (HFDMP) are scarce.Survival was calculated by race/ethnicity and gender for 837 patients enrolled in a HFDMP. (The patients studied were indigent African American and White outpatients [39% African American, 36% female] enrolled into at Leonard J. Chabert Medical Center in Houma, Louisiana.) The hazard ratio associated with demographic and clinical characteristic individually and as a whole, was estimated for the four groups.White males had the highest mortality (African American female: HR=0.64, African American male: HR=0.65, White female: HR=0.67, p<.05). Age (HR=1.04, p<.001), ejection fraction (HR=0.97, p<.001), New York Heart Association (NYHA) (HR=1.57, p<.001), systolic blood pressure (HR=0.99, p<.05), hematocrit (HR=0.96, p<.01), diabetes (HR=0.98, p<.05), and body mass index (HR=0.98, p<.05) were significant predictors of mortality in the univariate model. Age (HR=1.04, p<.001), NYHA (HR=1.40, p<.001), diabetes (HR=2.52, p<.001), and White female (HR=.44, p<.01) were significant predictors of mortality in the multivariate model.With the exception of White females, who demonstrated lower mortality, amongst African American males and females and White males who participated in a HFDMP no difference in survival was observed."Heart	Management	"Although sex-based disparities in use of guideline-recommended heart failure (HF) therapies have been described, little is known about whether performance improvement (PI) initiatives produce equitable improvements in guideline-recommended therapies.IMPROVE HF is a prospective study of a practice-based PI intervention in patients with systolic HF or post-myocardial infarction left ventricular dysfunction. Mean changes from baseline to 24 months after intervention were compared between women and men for treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, Î²-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and HF education. This analysis included 15,170 patients at 167 cardiology practices (4,383 [28.9%] women, 10,787 [71.1%] men). At baseline, women were less likely than men to be treated with anticoagulation and ICD. Significant improvements in 6 of 7 quality measures were evident at 24 months for both sexes. The absolute magnitude of improvement was similar for 5 measures and significantly better in women for CRT, ICD, and composite care.This PI intervention was associated with similar or greater increases in use of guideline-recommended HF therapies for eligible women compared with men. Clinical decision support and performance feedback may help to ensure improved, equitable care for men and women with HF."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Cardiac failure is associated with diminished activation of the transcription factor cyclic nucleotide regulatory element binding-protein (CREB), and heart-specific expression of a phosphorylation-deficient CREB mutant in transgenic mice [dominant negative CREB (dnCREB) mice] recapitulates the contractile phenotypes of cardiac failure (Fentzke RC, Korcarz CE, Lang RM, Lin H, Leiden JM. Dilated cardiomyopathy in transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative CREB transcription factor in the heart. J Clin Invest 101: 2415-2426, 1998). In the present study, we demonstrated significantly elevated mortality and contractile dysfunction in female compared with male dnCREB mice. Female dnCREB mice demonstrated a 21-wk survival of only 17% compared with 67% in males (P < 0.05) and exclusively manifest decreased cardiac peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ coactivator-1Î± and estrogen-related receptor-Î± content, suggesting sex-related effects on cardiac mitochondrial function. Hearts from 4-wk-old dnCREB mice of both sexes demonstrated diminished mitochondrial respiratory capacity compared with nontransgenic controls. However, by 12 wk of age, there was a significant decrease in mitochondrial density (citrate synthase activity) and deterioration of mitochondrial structure, as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy, in female dnCREB mice, which were not found in male transgenic littermates. Subsarcolemmal mitochondria isolated from hearts of female, but not male, dnCREB mice demonstrated increased ROS accompanied by decreases in the expression/activity of the mitochondrial antioxidants MnSOD and glutathione peroxidase. These results demonstrate that heart-specific dnCREB expression results in mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction in both sexes; however, increased oxidant burden, reduced antioxidant expression, and disrupted mitochondrial structure are exacerbated by the female sex, preceding and contributing to the greater contractile morbidity and mortality. These results provide further support for the role of the CREB transcription factor in regulating mitochondrial integrity and identify a critical pathway that may contribute to sex differences in heart failure."Heart	Clinical	"Elevated plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels suggest a high risk for future onset of cardiovascular events including congestive heart failure (CHF) and mortality. In the general population, although median plasma BNP levels have been reported to be higher in women than in men, the incidence of CHF and mortality are lower in women. However, no studies have examined gender-specific risk stratification of plasma BNP levels for future onset of CHF and mortality.Subjects of this study were recruited from our general population. Baseline data including plasma BNP were determined in 13,466 subjects (men 4527, women 8939; median age = 64 yrs). A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the predictive ability of plasma BNP for new onset of CHF and mortality.The mean follow-up duration was 2.9 years. After adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors including atrial fibrillation, hazard ratios for CHF development for values above the 75th percentile of BNP were 13.4 (p<0.001) in men and 8.5 (p<0.001) in women. Similarly, each increment of 1SD in log BNP levels increased the hazard ratio by 8.8 (p<0.001) in men, and 6.7 (p<0.001) in women. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was significant for prediction of the onset of CHF (men; 0.853, women; 0.838). In addition, increased plasma BNP levels implied high risk of any-cause mortality in men (above the 75th percentile; hazard ratio = 1.8, p=0.005: increment of 1SD; hazard ratio = 1.4, p=0.024), but this relationship was suboptimal in women.Measurements of plasma BNP provides strong predictive information about future onset of CHF in both sexes, with predictive ability for death being effective especially in men."Heart	Epidemiology	"Our objective was to determine the gender differences in the relation between the echocardiographic parameters of cardiac remodeling and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic stable angina. The baseline ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic volume, and end-systolic volume were assessed in 7,016 patients in the study ""A Coronary disease Trial Investigating Outcomes with Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system"" (ACTION). All-cause and cardiac mortality and incident heart failure were determined after a median of 5.0 years. Cox proportional hazard models were fit to determine the effect of gender on the relation between the echocardiographic parameters and clinical outcomes (interaction p <0.10). The association between the EF and mortality differed significantly between men and women, with women demonstrating a marked increase in risk as the EF decreased, compared to men (interaction p = 0.03, adjusted p = 0.07). Also, a significant interaction by gender was seen for the association between the end-systolic volume and the risk of heart failure (interaction p = 0.01, adjusted p = 0.05). In conclusion, the relation between EF and mortality differed according to gender in patients with chronic coronary disease, with women having a greater risk of adverse outcomes as the EF decreased. Similar findings were observed with the end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and the risk of heart failure. These findings may reflect inherent gender-based differences in ischemic heart disease and cardiac remodeling and might help to identify women at high risk."Heart	Pathophysiology	"This study examined sex differences in the regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure due to volume overload induced by arteriovenous (AV) shunt in rats. General characteristics and hemodynamic assessment revealed the presence of cardiac hypertrophy at 4 weeks of AV shunt in male (n = 12) and female (n = 12) rats, whereas heart failure was seen at 16 weeks in male rats only. Although a decrease in apoptosis was seen in hearts of both sexes at 4 weeks, an increase in apoptosis in males and a reduction in the female heart were observed at 16 weeks of AV shunt. Unlike females, increases in the pro-apoptotic proteins, BAX, caspases 3 and 9 were seen in 16 weeks post-AV shunt in male rats. While an increase in phospho-Bad was detected, phospho-Bcl-2 protein was decreased in males. Females showed an increase in only phospho-Bcl-2 protein at 16 weeks post-AV shunt. Ovariectomy (n = 12) abolished the increase in phospho-Bcl-2 protein, but this was restored by treatment with 17-beta estradiol. These data suggest that downregulation of phospho-Bcl-2 and an upregulation of BAX may play a major role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis in heart failure due to volume overload in male rats. Furthermore, upregulation of phospho-Bcl-2 in the heart due to estrogen may confer resistance against cardiomyocyte apoptosis in females."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Neurohormonal imbalance is a key determinant of the progression of heart failure (HF), which results in an elevated risk of mortality. A better understanding of mechanisms involved may influence treatment strategies. The incidence and prevalence of HF are lower in women. We explored sexual dimorphism in the progression of HF using a mice model of neurohormonal-dependent HF. Male and female mice overexpressing the human beta2-adrenergic receptor (TG4 strain) develop HF. We compared TG4 animals with age-matched wild-type controls. Cardiac function was studied in vivo by echocardiography and electrocardiography. Histological studies were performed. Conduction parameters were assessed by intracardiac electrophysiological exploration, as was the occurrence of spontaneous and inducible arrhythmias. The patch-clamp technique was used to determine the cellular electrophysiological profile. The role of hormonal status in HF progression was investigated by surgical gonadectomy. High mortality rate was observed in TG4 mice with a dramatic difference between males and females. Male TG4 mice exhibited intraventricular conduction abnormalities, as measured by infrahisian interval and QRS durations potentially determining reentrant circuits and increasing susceptibility to arrhythmia. The severity of HF was correlated with the degree of fibrosis, which was modulated by the gonadal hormones. Action potentials recorded from male and female left ventricular cardiomyocytes were indistinguishable, although both sexes exhibited delayed repolarization when compared with their wild-type counterparts. In conclusion, female TG4 mice were better protected than males against cardiac remodeling and rhythm disorders. A link between fibrosis, conduction time, and mortality was established in relation with sex hormones."Heart	Review	"Chronic heart failure (CHF) is the leading cause of all hospitalisations and readmissions in older people, accounting for a large proportion of developed countries' national health care expenditure. CHF can severely affect people's quality of life by reducing their independence and ability to undertake certain activities of daily living, as well as affecting their psychosocial and economic capacity. This paper reports the findings of a systematic narrative review of qualitative studies concerning people's experience of living with CHF, aiming to develop a wide-ranging understanding of what is known about the patient experience.We searched eight relevant electronic databases using the terms based on the diagnosis of 'chronic heart failure', 'heart failure' and 'congestive heart failure' and qualitative methods, with restrictions to the years 1990-May 2008. We also used snowballing, hand searching and the expert knowledge of the research team to ensure all relevant papers were included in the review. Of 65 papers collected less than half (n = 30) were found relevant for this review. These papers were subsequently summarised and entered into QSR NVivo7 for data management and analysis.The review has identified the most prominent impacts of CHF on a person's everyday life including social isolation, living in fear and losing a sense of control. It has also identified common strategies through which patients with CHF manage their illness such as sharing experiences and burdens with others and being flexible to changing circumstances. Finally, there are multiple factors that commonly impact on patients' self care and self-management in the disease trajectory including knowledge, understanding and health service encounters. These health service encounters encompass access, continuity and quality of care, co-morbid conditions, and personal relationships.The core and sub-concepts identified within this study provide health professionals, service providers, policy makers and educators with broad insights into common elements of people's experiences of CHF and potential options for improving their health and wellbeing. Future studies should focus on building a comprehensive picture of CHF through examination of differences between genders, and differences within age groups, socioeconomic groups and cultural groups."Heart	Review	"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the single leading cause of death in both men and women. A large proportion of the population with CVD will die with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF). It is becoming increasingly recognized that sex differences exist in the etiology, development, and outcome of CHF. For example, compared to male counterparts, women that present with CHF are typically older and have systolic cardiac function that is not impaired. Despite a growing body of literature addressing the underlying mechanisms of sex dimorphisms in cardiac disease, there remain significant inconsistencies reported in these studies. Given that the development of CHF results from the complex integration of genetic and nongenetic cues, it is not surprising that the elucidation and subsequent identification of molecular mechanisms remains unclear. In this review, key aspects of sex differences in CVD and CHF will be highlighted with an emphasis on some of the unanswered questions regarding these differences. The contention is presented that it becomes critical to reference cellular mechanisms within the context of each sex to better understand these sex dimorphisms."Heart	Outcomes	"Hospitalization for heart failure (HF) is associated with high-in-hospital and short- and long-term post discharge mortality. Age and gender are important predictors of mortality in hospitalized HF patients. However, studies assessing short- and long-term risk of death stratified by age and gender are scarce.A nationwide cohort was identified (ICD-9 codes 402, 428) and followed through linkage of national registries. The crude 28-day, 1-year and 5-year mortality was computed by age and gender. Cox regression models were used for each period to study sex differences adjusting for potential confounders (age and comorbidities).14,529 men, mean age 74 Â± 11 years and 14,524 women, mean age 78 Â± 11 years were identified. Mortality risk after admission for HF increased with age and the risk of death was higher among men than women. Hazard ratio's (men versus women and adjusted for age and co-morbidity) were 1.21 (95%CI 1.14 to 1.28), 1.26 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.31), and 1.28 (95%CI 1.24 to 1.31) for 28 days, 1 year and 5 years mortality, respectively.This study clearly shows age- and gender differences in short- and long-term risk of death after first hospitalization for HF with men having higher short- and long-term risk of death than women. As our study population includes both men and women from all ages, the estimates we provide maybe a good reflection of 'daily practice' risk of death and therefore be valuable for clinicians and policymakers."Heart	Management	"The influence of age and comorbidities on sex-specific implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) use for primary or secondary prevention is undefined.The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of age and comorbidities on sex-specific ICD use.Sex disparities and sex-specific trends in ICD implantation according to indication in patients with cardiac arrest (1998-2007) in Ontario, Canada, were examined. Use of ICDs for primary prevention in patients with myocardial infarction (2002-2007) or heart failure (2005-2007) also was examined.Among 9,246 eligible secondary prevention patients (age 66.3 +/- 14.3 years; 3,577 women [39%]) with cardiac arrest, men were more likely to undergo ICD implantation, with an age-, comorbidity-, and arrhythmia-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.66-2.23). Among 105,516 patients with myocardial infarction (age 68.3 +/- 12.7 years; 42,987 women [41%]), men were threefold more likely to undergo ICD implantation, with an adjusted HR of 3.00 (95% CI: 2.53-3.55). Among 61,160 patients with heart failure (age 76.2 +/- 12.0 years; 31,575 women [52%]), ICD implantation was more likely in men, with an adjusted HR of 3.01 (95% CI: 2.59-3.50). The odds of ICD implant for secondary prevention increased over time by 21% (95% CI: 13%-30%) in women and by 6% (95% CI: 2%-11%) in men, but rates of ICD use in men for primary prevention indications were persistently higher.Men were more likely to undergo defibrillator implant than were women for primary and secondary prevention. Age and comorbidities did not account for the observed sex differences. Although sex differences in secondary prevention are declining over time, disparities in primary prevention persist."Heart	Review	"Although women account for a significant proportion of the growing heart failure epidemic, they have been poorly represented in clinical trials. As emerging epidemiologic data reveal a growing prevalence and burden of disease among women, it is increasingly important that treating physicians and researchers recognize sex-based differences. Despite the overall incidence of heart failure being lower in women compared with men, the magnitude of improvement in survival over the last several decades has been less apparent in women. Women with heart failure are more likely to be older, have preserved systolic function and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. While clinical trials have demonstrated improved outcomes among heart failure patients, they have predominantly included men, yielding results that are sometimes inadequately powered to detect a benefit for women. Without adequate representation of women in clinical trials, one cannot assume that the same level of therapeutic evidence also applies to women. Nonetheless, it appears that beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors provide the same survival benefits in women with systolic dysfunction as in men. In addition, some studies suggest that angiotensin-receptor blockers may lead to a better survival in women when compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Focused research is needed to understand and guide the management of women with heart failure."Heart	Management	"Due to limited enrollment of women in previous trials, there is a paucity of data comparing outcome and arrhythmic events in men versus women with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs).We analyzed outcome of patients in the INTRINSIC RV (Inhibition of Unnecessary RV Pacing with AV Search Hysteresis in ICDs) trial based on gender. Women comprised 19% (293/1530) of the INTRINSIC RV population. Compared with men, women were less likely to have coronary disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and hyperlipidemia, and were more likely to have congestive heart failure and diabetes. Women were less likely to receive beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, and more likely to receive diuretics. Over 10.8 +/- 3.5 months of follow-up, unadjusted mortality was higher in women than men (6.8% vs 4.1%, P = 0.04). Heart failure hospitalizations occurred in 7.9% of women versus 5.7% of men (P = 0.13). After adjustment for baseline differences and drug therapy, there was no significant difference in mortality between men and women. Adverse events were observed more often in women. There were no gender differences in the percentage of patients receiving appropriate or inappropriate ICD shocks.In INTRINSIC RV, women receiving ICDs differed from men regarding baseline characteristics and drug therapy. After adjusting for baseline differences and medical therapy, there were no differences in heart failure hospitalization, survival, or ICD shock therapy during follow-up. Apparent undertreatment of heart failure and greater frequency of adverse advents in women receiving ICDs warrant further investigation."Heart	Clinical	"The use of synthetic progesterone-like substances in hormone replacement therapy and birth control pills has been associated with increases in cardiovascular morbidity and the prevalence of diabetes.The primary aims of this study were to investigate whether physiologic concentrations of progesterone might also be associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and to explore potential gender differences in these associations in elderly Swedish men and women.This prospective, longitudinal study was performed in a Swedish population-based sample of opposite-sex twins aged between 71 and 80 years who were not receiving sex hormone therapy. Serum concentrations of progesterone, estradiol, C-reactive protein (CRP), and urea were measured at baseline (1996) and at 8-year follow-up (2004), and serum concentrations of cystatin and insulin were measured only at follow-up. The outcomes of interest were cardiovascular morbidity (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, congestive heart failure [CHF], cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, and thromboembolism), diabetes, and mortality throughout the observation period.At baseline, the study sample included 230 men and 195 women (mean [SD] age, 74.6 [2.6] years). At follow-up, 132 men and 145 women (mean age, 82.4 [2.5] years) met the inclusion criteria, of whom 128 men and 112 women did so at both baseline and follow-up. Serum progesterone concentrations, which did not differ significantly from reported concentrations for the age group, were significantly associated with mortality across the observation period (P < 0.001). At follow-up, higher serum progesterone was significantly associated with the occurrence of CHF (P < 0.01); this association remained robust after adjustment for CRP, cystatin, and insulin levels.In these elderly Swedish men and women, increased physiologic concentrations of progesterone were found to be associated with an increased prevalence of CHF, independent of inflammatory factors, markers of renal function, and insulin metabolism."Heart	Management	"Despite a common view that women are better at self-care, there is very little evidence to support or challenge this perspective in the heart failure (HF) population.The purpose of this study was to determine if there are cross-cultural gender differences in self-reported HF self-care and to describe gender differences in the determinants of HF self-care.A secondary analysis was completed of cross-sectional study data collected on 2082 adults with chronic HF from the United States, Australia and Thailand.Comparisons were made between men and women regarding self-care maintenance, management and confidence as assessed by the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index, as well as the proportion of subjects engaged in adequate self-care. Multivariate comparisons were made to determine if gender explained sufficient variance in HF self-care and the likelihood of reporting adequate self-care, controlling for nine model covariates.The sample was comprised of 1306 men and 776 women. Most (73.5%) had systolic or mixed systolic and diastolic HF and 45% had New York Heart Association class III or IV HF. Although small and clinically insignificant gender differences were found in self-care maintenance, gender was not a determinant of any aspect of HF self-care in multivariate models. Married women were 37% less likely to report adequate self-care maintenance than unmarried women. Comorbidities only influenced the HF self-care of men. Being newly diagnosed with HF also primarily affected men. Patients with diastolic HF (predominantly women) had poorer self-care maintenance and less confidence in self-care.Differences in HF self-care are attributable to factors other than gender; however, there are several gender-specific determinants of HF self-care that help identify patients at risk for practicing poor self-care."Heart	Epidemiology	"Gender differences among patients with coronary artery disease vary from study to study. In one of the largest studies, the Japanese Coronary Artery Disease (JCAD) Study, gender differences in patients were investigated.Consecutive patients diagnosed with stenosis 75% or more in at least one branch of the coronary arteries were enrolled in the study. The endpoint is a composite of all-cause death and cardiovascular events. Data were collected over the internet. Out of 15,628 patients screened, 13,812 of them met the inclusion criteria and were followed up for a mean period of 2.7 years. The event rate was 62.8 per 1,000 patients-year, all-cause death 17.3 and total cardiac events 47.4. The incident rate of unstable angina was higher in females (27.1) than males (21.8) (P=0.0363). The incidence of all-cause death was lower in females than males (16.9 and 17.8, respectively; P=0.0148). Other than gender, hypertension and number of vessel disease contribute to the event of unstable angina, and age, family history, obesity, impaired fasting glycemia, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure and number of vessel disease contribute to the all-cause death.Gender is an independent contributing factor of unstable angina and of all-cause death."Heart	Management	"Women are at higher risk than men for adverse events with certain invasive cardiac procedures. Our objective was to compare rates of in-hospital adverse events in men and women receiving implantable cardioverter- defibrillator (ICD) therapy in community practice.Using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD Registry, we identified patients undergoing first-time ICD implantation between January 2006 and December 2007. Outcomes included in-hospital adverse events after ICD implantation. Multivariable analysis assessed the association between gender and in-hospital adverse events, with adjustment for demographic, clinical, procedural, physician, and hospital characteristics. Of 161,470 patients, 73% were male, and 27% were female. Women were more likely to have a history of heart failure (81% versus 77%, P<0.01), worse New York Heart Association functional status (57% versus 50% in class III and IV, P<0.01), and nonischemic cardiomyopathy (44% versus 27%, P<0.01) and were more likely to receive biventricular ICDs (39% versus 34%, P<0.01). In unadjusted analyses, women were more likely to experience any adverse event (4.4% versus 3.3%, P<0.001) and major adverse events (2.0% versus 1.1%, P<0.001). In multivariable models, women had a significantly higher risk of any adverse event (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.39) and major adverse events (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.86).Women are more likely than men to have in-hospital adverse events related to ICD implantation. Efforts are needed to understand the reasons for higher ICD implantation-related adverse event rates in women and to develop strategies to reduce the risk of these events."Heart	Outcomes	"To investigate gender-specific trends in long-term mortality in patients hospitalized for heart failure (HF).The Swedish hospital discharge and cause-specific death registers were used to calculate age- and gender-specific trends for long-term prognosis in patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of HF from 1987 to 2003. Mortality decreased, mainly during 1987-95, with no further decrease after 2001. Survival in men improved more than in women (P-value for interaction 0.0003), particularly among patients aged <65 years (P-value for interaction: age, gender, and year of hospitalization 0.0003) and more for patients with ischaemic when compared with non-ischaemic HF (P-value for interaction <0.0001). Among men <65 years, the hazard ratio (HR) of dying within 3 years after discharge was 0.40 (95% confidence interval 0.36-0.45) during 1999-2001 when compared with 1987-89. The corresponding HR for women was 0.58 (0.48-0.69). For those discharged during 1999-2001, almost 20% of the patients aged 35-64 years and 40% of those aged 65-84 years died within 3 years.Long-term mortality in HF in Sweden decreased more for men than for women and more for ischaemic than non-ischaemic HF. There was no further decrease after 2001. Long-term mortality after a first hospitalization remained high."Heart	Outcomes	"Previous studies have suggested that female and elderly patients with heart failure (HF) are less likely to receive guideline-recommended therapies, but these studies have involved select patient populations. We evaluated the differences in medical care and patient outcomes by age and gender among a broad cohort of hospitalized patients with HF. The Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) is a registry and performance-improvement program involving 48,612 patients with HF from 259 hospitals. The data were analyzed by gender, age <75 years, and age > or =75 years. Appropriate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker and beta-blocker use were similar between women and men (p = 0.244 and p = 0.237, respectively). However, compared with men, fewer women received hospital discharge instructions (p <0.001) and the length of stay was longer (p <0.001). Risk-adjusted in-hospital and postdischarge mortality were similar. All guideline-recommended cardiac medications were prescribed less frequently at discharge to eligible patients > or =75 than to those <75 years (all p <0.001). Older age was independently associated with in-hospital and postdischarge mortality risk increases (76% and 62%, respectively; p <0.001 for both). In conclusion, among the OPTIMIZE-HF hospitals, female patients with HF generally received similar medical care and had similar risks of adverse clinical outcomes compared with male patients. Older patients with HF were less likely to receive guideline-recommended therapies and remained at greater risk of adverse outcomes."Heart	Clinical	"Although left ventricular diastolic function has been shown to deteriorate with advancing age, its gender-specific change is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate age- and gender-specific changes in tissue Doppler-derived left ventricular diastolic index, E'.A total of 1333 healthy individual without known heart disease or hypertension (mean age, 55 years; range, 10 to 89) were enrolled and studied. Peak early mitral annular velocity (E') and peak late mitral annular velocity (A') were recorded and measured. As an index of the left ventricular relaxation, E' was used. As an index of the left ventricular filling pressure, E/E' was calculated. Although systolic indices poorly correlated with age, diastolic indices correlated well with age. Among those aged 30 to 39 and 40 to 49 years, E' was significantly lower in males than in females. In subjects aged 50 to 59 and 60 to 69 years, E' was similar in both genders. Among those aged 70 to 79 and 80 to 89 years, E' was significantly lower in females than in males. Predictors of the lowest quartile of E' among subjects aged >50 years were age (P<0.0001; chi(2)=66.11; odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.058 to 1.097) and female gender (P=0.002; chi(2)=9.23; odds ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.202 to 2.343).Age-related changes in diastolic indices were gender specific. In the elderly population, diastolic function deteriorated more significantly in the female gender than in the male gender. These results may explain the relatively higher incidence in elderly females among patients with diastolic heart failure and higher cardiovascular mortality in the female gender."Heart	Clinical	"The association of central adiposity with incident heart failure (HF) has yet to be studied in a large population-based study.The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study is an ongoing biracial population-based cohort of those aged 45 to 64 years from 4 US communities with 16 years' median follow-up for incident, hospitalized, or fatal HF. Waist-hip ratio, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI) were measured at baseline (1987-1989). After exclusions, the sample size was 14 641. BMI was categorized as <25, 25 to 29.9, and >or=30 kg/m(2). Waist circumference and waist-hip ratio were divided into gender-specific tertiles. A first occurrence of International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, codes of HF, either hospital discharge (428.0 to 428.9; n=1451) or on a death certificate (428.0 to 428.9 or I50.0 to I50.9; n=77) was considered an HF event. Cox models were adjusted for alcohol use, smoking, age, center, and educational level. The adjusted hazard ratios for the highest category (obese) compared with the lowest were well above 1.0 for all 3 anthropometric measures (hazard ratio for 3rd versus 1st tertile of waist-hip ratio: 2.27 [1.71, 3.02] for white women; 3.24 [2.25, 4.65] for black women; 2.46 [1.95, 3.09] for white men; and 2.63 [1.90, 3.65] for black men). Hazard ratios for overweight were lower in magnitude, suggesting a graded response between body size and HF.Obesity and overweight, as measured by 3 different anthropometrics, were associated with incident HF in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort. The current study does not support the superiority of waist-hip ratio and waist circumference over BMI for the prediction of incident HF."Heart	Pathophysiology	"We have previously shown that cardiac-specific inhibition of NF-kappaB attenuates angiotensin II (AngII)-induced left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in vivo. We now tested whether NF-kappaB inhibition is able to block LV remodelling upon chronic pressure overload and chronic AngII stimulation.Cardiac-restricted NF-kappaB inhibition was achieved by expression of a stabilized IkappaBalpha mutant (IkappaBalphaDeltaN) in cells with an active alpha-myosin heavy chain (alphaMHC) promoter employing the Cre/lox technique. Upon low-gradient trans-aortic constriction (TAC, gradient 21 +/- 3 mmHg), hypertrophy was induced in both male and female control mice after 4 weeks. At this time, LV hypertrophy was blocked in transgenic (TG) male but not female mice with NF-kappaB inhibition. Amelioration of LV hypertrophy was associated with activation of NF-kappaB by dihydrotestosterone in isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes. LV remodelling was not attenuated by NF-kappaB inhibition after 8 weeks TAC, demonstrated by decreased fractional shortening (FS) in both control and TG mice irrespective of gender. Similar results were obtained when TAC was performed with higher gradients (48 +/- 4 mmHg). In TG mice, FS dropped to similar low levels over the same time course [FS sham, 29 +/- 1% (mean +/- SEM); FS control + 14 days TAC, 13 +/- 3%; FS TG + 14 days TAC, 9 +/- 5%]. Similarly, LV remodelling was accelerated by NF-kappaB inhibition in an AngII-dependent genetic heart failure model (AT1-R(alphaMHC)) associated with significantly increased cardiac fibrosis in double AT1-R(alphaMHC)/TG mice.NF-kappaB inhibition attenuates cardiac hypertrophy in a gender-specific manner but does not alter the course of stress-induced LV remodelling, indicating NF-kappaB to be required for adaptive cardiac hypertrophy."Heart	Review	"At this point, guidelines recommend the same care for patients with chronic heart failure (HF), regardless of gender. In the future, however, HF care may need to be tailored by sex, as the best way to optimize outcomes for both men and women. Because prior studies demonstrated sex-related differences in many aspects of HF care (in the appropriate use and dosing of evidence-based therapy and in the individual response to pharmacological treatment between women and men with HF). In general, benefit of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and spironolactone in clinical trials was similar, regardless ofgender. Women with HF appear to have significantly lower mortality rates on ARBs than on the more standard HF therapy (ACE inhibitors), but there was no difference in survival in men prescribed ARBs compared to ACE inhibitors. In a post hoc subgroup analysis digoxin was associated with a increased risk of death from any cause among women with HF, but not men. ACE inhibitor-induced cough was more frequent among women. The risk ofhyperkalemia was increased with male gender in HF patients treated with candesartan. The use ofspironolactone was inversely associated with fractures in men with CHF. Previous studies have suggested that female with HF are less likely received guideline-recommended therapies (in appropriate doses). Female patients with HF were less likely to receive certain guideline-recommended evidence-based treatments, but the influence of patient sex on delivery of these therapies was disappeared when the objective reasons for non-using of these therapies were taken into account. These sex differences could have potential widespread implications for routine heart failure care."Heart	Review	"Heart failure affects 5 million Americans, and nearly 50% of these are women. Sex differences have been noted regarding the underlying etiology, pathophysiology, and prognosis. Women are less likely to have coronary artery disease and more likely than men to have hypertension and valvular disease as the underlying etiology. They often present at an older age with better systolic function than men. For both sexes, there is significant morbidity, but age-adjusted data reveal that women have a better survival. Despite these known sex differences, medical management recommendations are the same for women and men, because prospective sex-specific clinical trials have not been performed. However, our review raises some concerns that women might respond differently to therapy."Heart	Management	"An increasing interest has been shown in potential gender differences in treating patients with heart failure (HF), a serious condition for the individual. To evaluate whether there are any differences in the prevalence of HF, cardiac function, biomarkers, and the treatment of HF with respect to gender.All persons ages 70 to 80 in a rural municipality were invited to participate in the project; 876 persons accepted. Three cardiologists evaluated the patients including a new history, clinical examination, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, blood samples, and Doppler echocardiography to assess both systolic and diastolic function. The patients were followed during a mean period of 8 years.Females had hypertension more frequently and included fewer smokers than their male counterparts. A female preponderance was seen in those with preserved systolic function, whereas males predominated among those with systolic dysfunction. During the follow-up period, 20% of the males and 14% of the females died of cardiovascular diseases. The results did not show any inferior treatment of females with HF, but it clearly was more difficult to correctly classify female patients presenting with symptoms of HF."Heart	Epidemiology	"The race- and sex-specific epidemiology of incident heart failure (HF) among a contemporary elderly cohort are not well described.We studied 2934 participants without HF enrolled in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (mean [SD] age, 73.6 [2.9] years; 47.9% men; 58.6% white; and 41.4% black) and assessed the incidence of HF, population-attributable risk (PAR) of independent risk factors for HF, and outcomes of incident HF.During a median follow-up of 7.1 years, 258 participants (8.8%) developed HF (13.6 cases per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval, 12.1-15.4). Men and black participants were more likely to develop HF. No significant sex-based differences were observed in risk factors. Coronary heart disease (PAR, 23.9% for white participants and 29.5% for black participants) and uncontrolled blood pressure (PAR, 21.3% for white participants and 30.1% for black participants) carried the highest PAR in both races. Among black participants, 6 of 8 risk factors assessed (smoking, increased heart rate, coronary heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, uncontrolled blood pressure, and reduced glomerular filtration rate) had more than 5% higher PAR compared with that among white participants, leading to a higher overall proportion of HF attributable to modifiable risk factors in black participants vs white participants (67.8% vs 48.9%). Participants who developed HF had higher annual mortality (18.0% vs 2.7%). No racial difference in survival after HF was noted; however, rehospitalization rates were higher among black participants (62.1 vs 30.3 hospitalizations per 100 person-years, P < .001).Incident HF is common in older persons; a large proportion of HF risk is attributed to modifiable risk factors. Racial differences in risk factors for HF and in hospitalization rates after HF need to be considered in prevention and treatment efforts."Heart	Epidemiology	"Heart failure is now the commonest reason for hospitalization in Germany (German Federal Statistical Office, 2008). Heart failure will continue to be a central public health issue in the future as the population ages. This article focuses on regional differences, the costs of the disease, and the expected rate of increase in cases in the near future.This analysis is based on diagnosis statistics, cause-of-death statistics, and cost of illness data, as reported by the German Federal Statistical Office. Age- and sex-specific differences are taken into account.2006 was the first year in which heart failure led to more hospital admissions in Germany (317 000) than any other diagnosis. At present, about 141 000 persons in Germany aged 80 and over have heart failure; by the year 2050, it is predicted that more than 350 000 persons in this age group will be affected. The rate of diagnosis of heart failure, its frequency as a cause of death, and the costs associated with it all vary across the individual states of the Federal Republic of Germany. The nationwide cost of heart failure in 2006 was estimated at 2.9 billion euros.These findings reveal that heart failure has become more common as an admission diagnosis of hospitalized patients in Germany. Because the population is aging, new concepts for prevention and treatment will be needed in the near future so that the affected patients can continue to receive adequate care."Heart	Management	"The influence of patient age and sex on delivery of guideline-recommended heart failure (HF) therapies in contemporary outpatient settings has not been well studied. The Registry to Improve the Use of Evidence-Based Heart Failure Therapies in the Outpatient Setting (IMPROVE HF) is a prospective cohort study designed to characterize current management of outpatients with chronic HF and left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35%.Baseline data for eligible patients with systolic HF in a national registry of 167 US outpatient cardiology practices were collected by trained chart abstractors. Data were stratified and analyzed as male/female and by age tertiles with generalized estimating equation models constructed for 7 care measures.A total of 15,381 patients were enrolled, with 8,770 (71.1%) of these male. Median age of female patients was 72.0 and 70.0 for males. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, aldosterone inhibitors, and cardiac resynchronization therapy was not significantly different between male and female patients, but rates for implantable cardioverter defibrillators, anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation, and HF education were significantly lower for females. After adjusting for patient and practice characteristics, 3 of 7 measures significantly differed by patient sex, and 6 of 7 measures by age. Older patients, particularly older women, were significantly less likely to receive guideline-indicated HF therapies.Patient age and sex were independently associated with reduced rates of some, but not all, HF therapies in outpatient cardiology practices. Older women are especially at risk. Further research is needed to understand the causes and consequences of these age- and sex-related differences in care."Heart	Pathophysiology	"In heart disease, differences exist between women and men with respect to the impact of risk factors, symptoms, and therapeutic responses. The use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers is now well established in the treatment of mild and moderate systolic heart failure. Although there are significant differences among agents, their clinical effects are predictable. To address the question of sex disparities in the heart, however, we investigated the effect of treatment with the nonselective beta-blockers timolol and propranolol on mechanical and electrical function of heart preparations from male and female rats. We examined the long-term effects of intragastric treatment with timolol (5 mg/kg per day) or propranolol (25 mg/kg per day) for 7 months on the hemodynamic and intracellular action potential parameters of the heart. Chronic administration of timolol but not propranolol produced a significant increase in the baseline activity of the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) in both male and female rats with no significant effect on the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Timolol or propranolol treatment of male rats and timolol but not propranolol treatment of female rats induced significant shortening in the repolarization phases of action potentials recorded from left ventricular papillary muscle strips of the hearts. The responses of LVDP to beta-adrenergic stimulation were similar in timolol- or propranolol-treated or untreated male rats. On the other hand, timolol treatment markedly increased, and propranolol treatment significantly decreased, the responses of increase in LVDP in female rats. Our results suggest that although treatment with beta-blockers for 7 months confirmed the role of the beta-adrenergic pathway in heart function, there are marked differences in the effects of individual beta-blockers on heart physiology. Sex differences should be taken into consideration when using beta-blockers during experimental studies and clinical therapy."Heart	Outcomes	"The heterogeneity evident among home care clients highlights the need for greater understanding of the clinical and social determinants of multi-dimensional health-related quality of life (HRQL) indices and of potential sex-differences in these determinants. We examined the relative contribution of social and clinical factors to HRQL among older home care clients and explored whether any of the observed associations varied by sex.The Canadian-US sample included 514 clients. Self-reported HRQL was measured during in-home interviews (2002-04) using the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2). Data on clients' sociodemographic, health and clinical characteristics were obtained with the Minimum Data Set for Home Care. The relative associations between clients' characteristics and HUI2 scores were examined using multivariable linear regression models.Women had a significantly lower mean HUI2 score than men (0.48, 95%CI 0.46-0.50 vs. 0.52, 0.49-0.55). Clients with distressed caregivers and poor self-rated health exhibited significantly lower HRQL scores after adjustment for a comprehensive list of clinical conditions. Several other factors remained statistically significant (arthritis, psychiatric illness, bladder incontinence, urinary tract infection) or clinically important (reported loneliness, congestive heart failure, pressure ulcers) correlates of lower HUI2 scores in adjusted analyses. These associations generally did not vary significantly by sex.For females and males, HRQL scores were negatively associated with conditions predictive or indicative of disability and with markers of psychosocial stress. Despite sex differences in the prevalence of social and clinical factors likely to affect HRQL, few varied significantly by sex in their relative impact on HUI2 scores. Further exploration of differences in the relative importance of clinical and psychosocial well-being (e.g., loneliness) to HRQL among female and male clients may help guide the development of sex-specific strategies for risk screening and care management."Heart	Epidemiology	"There is little epidemiological data on heart failure (HF) in the younger age groups dominating clinical HF trials. We assessed gender-specific long-term HF incidence and mortality in an urban community-based sample of middle-aged subjects. Between 1974 and 1992, 33,342 HF-free subjects (10,900 [32.7%] women, mean age 45.7 +/- 7.4 years) were included in the MalmÃ¶ Preventive Project, on average 21.7 +/- 4.3 years before study end. Patients hospitalised for or dying of HF were categorised as HF patients, and 120 (1.1%) women versus 644 (2.9%) men experienced HF: 6.0 vs. 12.3 cases per 10,000 person years; hazard ratio [HR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.74, P < 0.0001. Among all subjects, women compared with men had lower all-cause (49.3 vs. 84.0 cases per 10,000 person years; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.64-0.73, P < 0.0001) and HF-related (2.6 vs. 7.4 cases per 10,000 person years; HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37-0.67, P < 0.0001) mortality risk. Female and male HF patients had similar age-adjusted mortality risk: 1,314 vs. 1,602 cases per 10,000 patient years; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.58-1.07, P = 0.12. Among HF patients, 55.3% of deaths in women and 40.6% in men were non-cardiovascular, and only 7.9% deaths were due to HF.In a middle-aged, urban, community-based sample, women had lower risk of HF, all-cause death and HF-related death over two decades of follow-up. Female and male HF patients had similar mortality risk after the diagnosis of HF. In these comparatively young HF patients, few deaths were due to HF and more than 4 out of 10 deaths were non-cardiovascular."Heart	Epidemiology	"In Switzerland there is a shortage of population-based information on heart failure (HF) incidence and case fatalities (CF). The aim of this study was to estimate HF event rates and both in- and out-of-hospital CF rates.Data on HF diagnoses coded according to I 50 (ICD 10) were taken from the Federal Hospital Statistics Database and the Cause of Death Database for the year 2005.Although the total estimated number of HF events was higher for women (n = 4,201) than for men (n = 3,819), men showed higher numbers up to age group 65-74. Looking at age-specific HF cases per 100,000 population, men had higher rates in all age groups. The latter is also true of the age-standardised HF event rate (82.9/100,000 versus 51.4/100,000 population). Overall, CF was 26.3% and higher for women (32.2%) than for men (19.8%). The same is true of out-of-hospital CF but not of in-hospital CF.The HF event rate was 20% higher than the HF hospital discharge rate. Out-of-hospital death from HF accounted for the largest proportion of total HF deaths. Sex differences in both the number of HF events and HF event rates can be explained by the larger number of women than men aged 55+ in the Swiss population."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Pressure overload (PO) first causes cardiac hypertrophy and then heart failure (HF), which are associated with sex differences in cardiac morphology and function. We aimed to identify genes that may cause HF-related sex differences. We used a transverse aortic constriction (TAC) mouse model leading to hypertrophy without sex differences in cardiac function after 2 weeks, but with sex differences in hypertrophy 6 and 9 weeks after TAC. Cardiac gene expression was analyzed 2 weeks after surgery. Deregulated genes were classified into functional gene ontology (GO) categories and used for pathway analysis. Classical marker genes of hypertrophy were similarly upregulated in both sexes (alpha-actin, ANP, BNP, CTGF). Thirty-five genes controlling mitochondrial function (PGC-1, cytochrome oxidase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) had lower expression in males compared to females after TAC. Genes encoding ribosomal proteins and genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling exhibited relative higher expression in males (collagen 3, matrix metalloproteinase 2, TIMP2, and TGFbeta2, all about twofold) after TAC. We confirmed 87% of the gene expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction. By GO classification, female-specific genes were related to mitochondria and metabolism and males to matrix and biosynthesis. Promoter studies confirmed the upregulation of PGC-1 by E2. Less downregulation of metabolic genes in female hearts and increased protein synthesis capacity and deregulation of matrix remodeling in male hearts characterize the sex-specific early response to PO. These differences could contribute to subsequent sex differences in cardiac function and HF."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Gender is an independent risk factor for heart failure mortality in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).To explore the interaction between gender, myocardial fibrosis and remodelling in HCM.We studied 64 HCM patients (28 females, aged 51+/-16 years) categorized as non-obstructive (HNCM, n=31) or obstructive (HOCM, n=33) and 60 healthy subjects (31 females, aged 43+/-14 years). Cine imaging was performed to assess left ventricular volumes and mass. LV remodelling index (LVRI) was calculated. Extension of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was quantified.Females in the control group and in the HNCM group had a lower LVRI than males (control: 0.7+/-0.1 vs. 0.9+/-0.2 g/ml, p<0.002; HNCM: 1.1+/-0.2 vs. 1.5+/-0.5 g/ml, p<0.001). In contrast, HOCM females had a similar LVRI compared to males (1.8+/-0.5 vs. 1.7+/-0.4 g/ml, p=ns). Thus the increase in LVRI was more pronounced in females compared to males. LGE was noted in 70% of the patients. No relation was found between the presence or the quantity of myocardial fibrosis and gender in any of the patient subgroups.Our data suggest a disproportionate degree of remodelling in different forms of HCM depending on gender. Gender does not appear to influence the quantity of fibrosis as defined by LGE."Heart	Management	"To determine gender differences in diagnostic workup and treatment of patients with heart failure.Retrospective.The data of 8914 patients (of whom 4166 women; 47%) with confirmed heart failure, who participated in the Euro Heart Survey on Heart Failure (EHS-HF) were analysed.On average, the women in the study were older than the men (75 versus 68 years) and less often suffered from a coronary heart disease (56 versus 66%). Women were more likely to have hypertension (59 versus 49%), diabetes mellitus (29 versus 26%), or valvular heart disease (42 versus 36%). Fewer women had an ultrasonographic evaluation of ventricular function (59 versus 74%) and, among those investigated, fewer had left ventricular systolic dysfunction (44 versus 72%). These observed results remained stable after adjustment for age and other possible confounding variables. Medication with a documented positive impact on survival, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blocking drugs and the diuretic spironolactone, was prescribed less often to women than men. Women, however, received symptomatic medication such as other diuretics and digoxin more often than men.Men and women with heart failure differed with respect to a number of relevant clinical characteristics. Clinicians should take good note of this and take measures to prevent differences in patient care."Heart	Management	"Recent studies suggest that B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is an important predictor of cardiac events in hypertensive patients.The relationship between the plasma BNP level and various clinical parameters was examined in 154 untreated hypertensive patients without heart failure or atrial fibrillation (mean age: 58.0+/-10.7; mean blood pressure: 164.5+/-15.2/99.1+/-9.7 mmHg; mean BNP: 32.7+/-36.7 pg/ml). First, the patients were divided into 2 groups based on BNP: normal (<18.5 pg/ml, mean 9.7+/-5.7, n=69); or elevated (>18.5 pg/ml, mean 51.4+/-40.4, n=85). The elevated BNP group had a significantly greater electrocardiographic voltage index (SV1+RV5; 3.7+/-1.2 vs 3.2+/-0.8 mV, p=0.0029), cardiothoracic ratio/chest radiography (CTR; 49.1 vs 46.9%, p=0.0037), left ventricular mass index (LVMI; 122.2+/-31.7 vs 103.1+/-26.4 g/m2, p=0.0005) and deceleration time (DT; 241+/-39 vs 208+/-30 ms, p=0.0001), as well as a smaller E-wave to A-wave (E/A ratio) (0.80+/-0.22 vs 0.96+/-0.28, p=0.0003), compared with the normal BNP group. There were no significant differences in casual blood pressure, body mass index, serum creatinine and ejection fraction between the 2 groups. Next, the patients were divided into 3 groups based on BNP: normal (<18.5, n=69), moderate (18.5 to 40, mean 27.0+/-5.7, n=43) and high (40<, mean 76.3+/-45.3, n=42). In the high BNP group, most clinical parameters indicated the most severe organ damage compared with other groups, including SV1+RV5, DT and LVMI. In all patients, logarithmic BNP was positively correlated with the age, pulse pressure, SV1+RV5, CTR, ventricular wall thickness, DT, LVMI and negatively correlated with hemoglobin, renin and E/A ratio. Using multiple regression analysis, renin and DT were significantly associated with BNP. No gender differences in the relationship between BNP and clinical parameters were found.Results suggest that BNP is a useful indicator for the initial assessment of the severity of essential hypertension, detecting both cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, and may also be valuable for risk stratification."Heart	Review	"Heart failure represents a major source of morbidity and mortality in industrialized nations. As the leading hospital discharge diagnosis in the United States in patients over the age of 65, it is also associated with substantial economic costs. While the acute symptoms of volume overload frequently precipitate inpatient admission, it is the symptoms of chronic heart failure, including fatigue, exercise intolerance and exertional dyspnea, that impact quality of life. Over the last two decades, research into the enzymatic, histologic and neurohumoral alterations seen with heart failure have revealed that hemodynamic derangements do not necessarily correlate with symptoms. This ""hemodynamic paradox"" is explained by alterations in the skeletal musculature that occur in response to hemodynamic derangements. Importantly, gender specific effects appear to modify both disease pathophysiology and response to therapy. The following review will discuss our current understanding of the systemic effects of heart failure before examining how exercise training and cardiac resynchronization therapy may impact disease course."Heart	Management	"This study evaluated gender differences in clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome among patients with heart failure, and to what extent these differences are due to age and differences in left ventricular (LV) function. Although gender differences are observed among heart failure patients, few studies have been adequately powered to investigate these differences.A total of 8914 (out of 10 701) patients (47% women) from the Euro Heart Survey on Heart Failure with confirmed diagnosis of heart failure were included in the analyses.Women were older (74.7 vs 68.3 years, p<0.001), and less often had evidence of coronary artery disease (56% vs 66%, age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.62; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.68). Women were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, or valvular heart disease. Fewer women had an investigation of LV function (59% vs 74%, age-adjusted OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.74), and, among those investigated, fewer had moderate/severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (44% vs 71%, age-adjusted OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.39). Drugs with a documented impact on survival, that is ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers, were given less often to women, even in the adjusted analysis (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.86 and OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.89, respectively). 12-week mortality was similar for men and women.Fewer women had an assessment of LV function, but, when investigated, women had better ventricular function. Women were less often treated with evidence-based drugs, even after adjustment for age and important clinical characteristics. Clinicians need to be aware of deficiencies in the treatment of women with heart failure and measures should be taken to rectify them."Heart	Management	"The Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) demonstrated that implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy reduced overall mortality in patients with class II or III heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <or= 35%, while amiodarone had no effect on survival. There are limited data regarding the influence of gender on outcome of patients receiving ICDs for primary prevention.We examined gender differences in response to treatment and outcome in this cohort.Women comprised 23% of the SCD-HeFT cohort, with similar percentages in the amiodarone, ICD, and placebo groups. Compared with men, women were more likely to be non-Caucasian, to have class III heart failure, and nonischemic heart disease. After adjustment for baseline differences, overall mortality risk was lower in women than in men. The gender difference in overall mortality was seen in the placebo group, while no gender difference in overall mortality was seen in the ICD group. There was a significantly lower absolute risk of death in the placebo arm women, compared with the placebo arm men (annual mortality rate approximately 4% vs. 6%).The impact of ICD therapy appears to differ between men and women in this trial, with a smaller ICD benefit among women. However, the test for an interaction between gender and therapy was not significant. The lower overall mortality risk in women in the placebo group and the smaller number of women enrolled may help to explain why treatment differences in women were much smaller and difficult to detect."Heart	Clinical	"We sought to determine the gender-specific effects of obesity on myocardial metabolism, work, and efficiency.Myocardial metabolism abnormalities may contribute to the development of obesity-related heart failure. Increased myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO(2)) and fatty acid (FA) metabolism and decreased efficiency occur with obesity in women. It is unknown whether similar changes occur with obesity in men.We quantified cardiac work, efficiency, myocardial blood flow (MBF), MVO(2), glucose, and FA metabolism with echocardiography and positron emission tomography in nonobese and obese men and women (N = 86).There were significant differences between the obese (n = 35) and nonobese (n = 51) subjects in age, body composition, plasma lipids, and insulin resistance in addition to differences between the men (n = 30) and women (n = 56) in body composition and plasma lipids. Female gender independently predicted increased cardiac work (p < 0.001). Female gender also related to lower efficiency (p < 0.05). Obesity and female gender independently predicted greater MBF (p < 0.01, p < 0.0005, respectively) and MVO(2) (p < 0.0005, p < 0.0001). Myocardial glucose uptake was not different among the 4 subject groups, but obesity and gender interacted in predicting glucose uptake (p < 0.05). Lower myocardial glucose utilization was independently predicted by female gender (p < 0.05), and it independently predicted lower myocardial glucose utilization/plasma insulin (p < 0.05). Obesity and gender significantly interacted in the determination of glucose utilization/plasma insulin (p = 0.01). There were no differences in FA uptake among the 4 groups, and although increasing obesity correlated with greater myocardial FA utilization and oxidation; female gender (p < 0.005, p < 0.01) and plasma triglycerides (p < 0.05, p < 0.005) were their independent predictors.Women's and men's myocardial metabolic responses to obesity are not exactly the same. Obesity and gender modulate MBF and MVO(2), are related to myocardial substrate metabolism, and sometimes interact in its prediction. Gender modifies efficiency. Gender-related differences in myocardial metabolism may affect the development of/adaptation to obesity-related cardiac disease."Heart	Epidemiology	"Sexual dysfunction is a common problem of increasing incidence that is associated with multiple co-morbid conditions and chronic diseases. In heart failure, however, exact numbers are unknown, in part secondary to under-reporting and under-interrogating by health care providers. A gender-specific questionnaire was modified from established sexual dysfunction questionnaires to correspond to a non-randomized outpatient heart failure population, to assess the prevalence and demographic distribution of sexual dysfunction and potential treatments expectations. One-hundred patients in a stable hemodynamic condition in New York Heart Association classes I-III participated. Eighty-seven percent of women were diagnosed with female sexual dysfunction compared to 84% of men with erectile dysfunction. Eighty percent of women reported reduced lubrication, which resulted in frequent unsuccessful intercourse in 76%. Thirty-six percent of patients thought that sexual activity could harm their current cardiac condition; 75% of females and 60% of men stated that no physicians ever asked about potential sexual problems. Fifty-two percent of men considered sexual activity in their current condition as an essential aspect of quality of life and 61% were interested in treatment to improve sexual function. Sexual dysfunction appears to be high in prevalence in both men and women with chronic compensated heart failure and represents a reduction in quality of life for most. Despite the fact that most patients are interested in receiving therapy to improve sexual dysfunction, treatment options are rarely discussed or initiated."Heart	Review	"Evaluation of: Hernandez AF, Fonarow GC, Lang L et al.:Sex and racial differences in the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators among patients hospitalized with heart failure.JAMA298(13), 1525-1532 (2007) [1] . Disparity of utilization of proven therapies for treatment of cardiac disease according to gender and ethnicity has been well documented in various aspects of cardiac care. Implanted cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) are devices that have been proven to prevent sudden cardiac death. This retrospective study examined ICD use in heart-failure patients who had an indication for ICD implantation, from the ""Get with the Guidelines"" program. The patients were stratified by gender and ethnicity (Black vs White). The overall rate of utilization (or intention for utilization) of ICDs was 35%, while among women and Black people the rate was significantly lower, at 27 and 23%, respectively, with the lowest rate being for Black women (28%). These findings suggest a bias against implantation of such devices in women and Black people, which is not explained by clinical variables."Heart	Epidemiology	"This analysis evaluates the gender differences in patients hospitalised for acute heart failure (AHF) in the EuroHeart Failure Survey II (EHFS).Of the 3580 patients included in EHFS II, 1384 (39%) were women, mean age 73 years. 2196 (61%) were men, mean age 68 years. Women more frequently had new-onset AHF, hypertension and valvular disease and less frequently coronary heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy compared with men. Smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral arterial disease and renal failure were less common, but diabetes and anaemia significantly more frequent in women. Atrial fibrillation and preserved left ventricular function were more common in women. Men were more often non-compliant with medication. After adjustment for indications and age, there were no significant gender differences in prescription of HF medication. All-cause readmission rate during the one-year follow-up was lower in women. However, the proportion of HF hospitalisation and one-year mortality after discharge (20%) were similar in both genders.Women frequently present with new-onset AHF. A significant gender difference exists in aetiology, ventricular function and co-morbidities. Women's use of HF medication has improved. These findings emphasize the importance of individualised management and need for more comprehensive recruitment of women in clinical trials."Heart	Epidemiology	"The prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) is poor in both men and women. However, the characteristics of, and effective treatment strategy for, female CHF patients still remain unclear. This study was designed to evaluate the prognosis and characteristics of female patients in a CHF cohort termed the Chronic Heart Failure Analysis and Registry in the Tohoku District.Of 1,278 patients registered in the cohort, the study population comprised 1,166 symptomatic CHF patients with sufficient data. As compared with male patients, female patients were more likely to be older, have preserved systolic function and non-ischemic etiology of CHF, and underuse standard CHF medications. Although a previous study showed that sex-difference was not a significant prognostic factor in CHF patients, the unadjusted survival analysis revealed an increased event rate in female patients in the present study. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age, diabetes, ventricular tachycardia and anemia were significant prognostic risks in both men and women with CHF.Female sex had a significant link with elderly CHF patients. Given the explosive increase in elderly patients in Westernized countries, further studies are needed to elucidate the evidence for treatment of female CHF patients."Heart	Management	"Although self-care may reduce exacerbations of heart failure, reported rates of effective self-care in patients with heart failure are low. Modifiable factors, including psychosocial status, knowledge, and physical factors, are thought to influence heart failure self-care, but little is known about their combined impact on self-care.The objective of this study was to identify factors related to self-care behaviors in patients with heart failure.A cross-sectional, correlational study design was used.One hundred twenty-two patients (77 men and 45 women, mean age 60+/-12 years old, 66% New York Heart Association functional class III/IV) were recruited from the outpatient clinics of an academic medical center and two community hospitals.Data on self-care behaviors (Self-Care of Heart Failure Index), depressive symptoms, perceived control, self-care confidence, knowledge, functional status, and social support were collected. Factors related to self-care were examined using hierarchical multiple regression.Mean self-care behavior scores were less than 70 indicating the majority of men and women with HF did not consistently engage in self-care behaviors. Higher self-care confidence and perceived control and better heart failure management knowledge were associated with better self-care (r2=.25, p<.001). Higher perceived control and better knowledge were related to better self-care behaviors in men (r2=.18, p=.001), while higher self-care confidence and poorer functional status were related to better self-care behaviors in women (r2=.35, p<.001).This study demonstrates the substantial impact of modifiable factors such as confidence in one's self-care abilities, perceived control, and knowledge on self-care behaviors. This study demonstrates that there are gender differences in factors affecting self-care, even though at baseline men and women have similar knowledge levels, physical, psychological, and behavioral status. Effective interventions focusing on modifiable factors and the unique characteristics of men and women should be provided to improve self-care behaviors in patients with heart failure."Heart	Outcomes	"There are conflicting data on gender differences in survival among heart failure (HF) patients. We prospectively assessed gender differences in survival among 930 consecutive patients (464 [49.9%] women, mean age 76.1+/-10.1 years), admitted to hospital with suspected or diagnosed HF.Overall, women had lower unadjusted mortality hazard ratio (HR) than men: HR 0.827; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.690-0.992; p=0.040. Adjusted HR was 0.786; 95% CI 0.601-1.028; p=0.079. Unadjusted mortality was significantly higher among patients with a discharge HF diagnosis, compared to those without: HR 1.330; 95% CI 1.107-1.597; p=0.002; adjusted p=0.289. Women and men with a discharge HF diagnosis had similar survival: unadjusted HR 1.052; 95% CI 0.829-1.336; p=0.674; adjusted HR 0.875; 95% CI 0.625-1.225; p=0.437. Women had lower mortality risk among patients without a discharge HF diagnosis: HR 0.630, 95% CI 0.476-0.833, p=0.001; adjusted HR 0.611, p=0.036.Prognosis was poor among patients hospitalised with suspected or diagnosed HF. Among all patients, women had better survival, whereas both sexes had similar survival when the HF diagnosis was certified."Heart	Pathophysiology	"We report the first comprehensive analysis of gene expression differences by sex and age in left ventricular samples from 102 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.Gene expression data (HG-U133A gene chip, Affymetrix) were analyzed from 30 females and 72 males from 3 separate centers. More than 1800 genes displayed sexual dimorphism in the heart (adjusted P value <0.05). A significant number of these genes were highly represented in gene ontology pathways involved in ion transport and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. Localization of these genes revealed enrichment on both the sex chromosomes as well as chromosomes 3, 4, and 14. The second goal of this study was to determine the effect of age on gene expression. Within the female cohort, >140 genes were differentially expressed in the <55 years age group compared with the >55 years age group. These genes were highly represented in gene ontology pathways involved in DNA damage. In contrast, zero genes in the male cohort <55 years met statistical significance when compared with the >55 years age group.Gene expression in dilated cardiomyopathy displayed evidence of sexual dimorphism similar to other somatic tissues and age dimorphism within the female cohort."Heart	Outcomes	"Broad population studies of patients with stable ambulatory heart failure have associated female gender with better age-adjusted survival. This study investigated whether there are gender-specific differences in clinical presentation, response to intensive medical therapy, and outcomes in patients admitted with advanced (cardiac index <2.4 L/min/m(2)) decompensated heart failure (ADHF). We reviewed 278 consecutive patients (age 54 +/- 12 years, cardiac index 1.7 +/- 0.4 L/kg/m(2), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 26 +/- 9 mm Hg, serum creatinine 1.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dl) with ADHF treated with intensive medical therapy guided by pulmonary artery catheter in a dedicated heart failure intensive care unit from 2000 to 2006. Compared with men (n = 226), women (n = 52) had similar baseline characteristics with the exception of a higher prevalence of nonischemic cause. No differences in medical therapy on admission, during intensive medical therapy, or at discharge were observed. Intensive medical therapy was associated with significant hemodynamic improvement independent of gender. All-cause mortality and heart failure rehospitalization rates were similar between genders. However, adjusted for cause, women with ischemic cardiomyopathy had higher all-cause mortality rates (50% vs 37%, hazard ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 3.90, p = 0.05) and those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy had lower all-cause mortality rates (19% vs 40%, hazard ratio 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.17 to 0.96, p = 0.01) than men. In conclusion, women presenting with ADHF had baseline characteristics and response to therapy similar to men. Overall outcomes were similar between men and women, although subgroup analysis suggested better survival for women with a nonischemic cause."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Recent awareness of cardiovascular diseases as a number one killer of the middle-aged women has prompted interest in sex differences leading to heart failure (HF). Therefore, we evaluated cardiac function in female and male mice following myocardial infarction (MI) using the Millar pressure-volume (P-V) conductance system in vivo, at time points corresponding to early (2 wk), late compensatory hypertrophy (4 wk), and decompensation (10 wk) to HF. A significant deterioration of the load dependent and independent hemodynamic measurements occurred in both female and male mice during the early phase of hypertrophy. Later, compensatory hypertrophy was marked by a normalization of volumes to control levels in females compared with males. The most notable differences between sexes occurred in the measurements of cardiac contractility during the decompensation to HF. In females, there was a significant improvement in contractility compared with males, which was apparent in the load-independent measurements of preload recruitable stroke work (10 wk post-MI, female=48.7+/-8.0 vs. male=25.2+/-1.8 mmHg, P<0.05) and maximum dP/dt vs. maximum end-diastolic volume (10 wk post-MI, female=359+/-58 vs. male=149+/-28 mmHg.s(-1).microl(-1), P<0.05). Despite these differences, there were no differences in the heart weight to body weight ratio and infarct size between the sexes. These data demonstrate that compensatory hypertrophy is associated with an improvement in contractility and a delayed decompensation to HF in females. However, compensatory hypertrophy in males appears to be undermined by a steady decline in contractility associated with decompensation to HF."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) constitutes a large portion of patients with heart failure of unknown etiology. Up to 50% of all transplant recipients carry this clinical diagnosis. Female-specific gene expression in IDCM has not been explored. We report sex-related differences in the gene expression profile of ventricular myocardium from patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. We produced and sequenced subtractive cDNA libraries, using human left ventricular myocardium obtained from male transplant recipients with IDCM and nonfailing human heart donors. With the resulting sequence data, we generated a custom human heart failure microarray for IDCM containing 1,145 cardiac-specific oligonucleotide probes. This array was used to characterize RNA samples from female IDCM transplant recipients. We identified a female gene expression pattern that consists of 37 upregulated genes and 18 downregulated genes associated with IDCM. Upon functional analysis of the gene expression pattern, deregulated genes unique to female IDCM were those that are involved in energy metabolism and regulation of transcription and translation. For male patients we found deregulation of genes related to muscular contraction. These data suggest that 1) the gene expression pattern we have detected for IDCM may be specific for this disease and 2) there is a sex-specific profile to IDCM. Our observations further suggest for the first time ever novel targets for treatment of IDCM in women and men."Heart	Epidemiology	"Heart failure (HF) is increasing in prevalence in the United States. Little data exists on race and gender differences in HF incidence rates and case fatality. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort is a population-based study from 4 United States communities (1987 to 2002). Prevalent HF cases (n = 750) were identified by self-report and were excluded. Incident HF was defined by the International Classification of Diseases codes for HF (428.0 to 428.9, I50) from a hospitalization (n = 1,206) or death certificate (n = 76). There were 1,282 incident HF cases over 198,417 person-years. The age-adjusted incidence rate (per 1,000 person-years) for Caucasian women, 3.4, was significantly less compared with all other groups (Caucasian men, 6.0; African-American women, 8.1; African-American men, 9.1). Age-adjusted HF incidence rates were greater for African-Americans than Caucasians, but adjustment for confounders attenuated the difference. The adjusted African-American-to-Caucasian hazard ratio was 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.06) for men, and similarly, 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 1.90) for women during the second half of follow-up. The hazard ratio for women during the first half of follow-up was 1.79 (95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 2.55). Thirty-day, 1-year, and 5-year case fatalities following hospitalization for HF were 10.4%, 22%, and 42.3%, respectively. African-Americans had a greater 5-year case fatality compared with Caucasians (p <0.05). In conclusion, heart failure incidence rates in African-American women were more similar to those of men than of Caucasian women. The greater HF incidence in African-Americans than in Caucasians is largely explained by African-Americans' greater levels of atherosclerotic risk factors."Heart	Review	"Sex-related differences in clinical and laboratory characteristics, course and prognosis are well documented in patients with heart failure. However, most information regarding heart failure therapies has been obtained from studies conducted primarily in men. Reviewing the existing literature indicates that the recommendations regarding pharmacological and device therapies should apply similarly to men and women. One possible exception, however, is the possibility of more benefit derived from angiotensin receptor blockers in women, and from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in men. Future clinical trials should be conducted either exclusively in women or have a larger representation of women to insure the adequate assessment of the potential benefit versus risk in women."Heart	Management	"We investigated the hypothesis that there are prognostic differences in the importance of left ventricular (LV) mass and function between male and female patients hospitalized with heart failure.Patients > or =60 years old hospitalized with New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure and LV systolic dysfunction were prospectively followed for > or =18 months. At study start, a physical examination and echocardiography were performed, and blood chemistry samples were obtained.Of 158 patients, 66 (42%) women were included and were followed for a mean of 3.1 years. The women were older (77 +/- 7 vs. 74 +/- 7 years, p < 0.01) and had lower mortality (24% vs. 43%, p < 0.05) than the men. No gender differences in etiology or medication were found. LV mass index (LVMI 132 +/- 42 vs. 156 +/- 21 g/m(2), p < 0.01) was lower in women. Mortality in women was related to lower LV ejection fraction, larger LV volumes, and higher LVMI (all p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, LVMI was the strongest independent mortality predictor in women (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] LMVI >125 g/m(2) 7.4 [1.5-35.5], p = 0.01), whereas this association was not found in men.In patients hospitalized with systolic heart failure, women had lower mortality than men. In women, an increased LVMI was a stronger predictor of mortality than traditional measures of LV size and function. LVMI should be considered for assessment of prognosis in women with heart failure."Heart	Management	"The goal of this study was to investigate gender-specific differences in prevalence, healthcare costs, and treatment patterns in the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI).The study analyzed administrative claims data of over 26 million insured with respect to prevalence and cost of illness of six chronic diseases. Insured were identified using the ATC code for medication prescription and ICD-9 code for diagnosis. The influences of gender, age, and comorbidity on cost differences were analyzed via multivariate regression analysis.Adjusted for age and comorbidity, gender had a significant influence on both hospital and medication spending. Hospital costs on average were 17.1% (95% CI 14.1; 20.2) higher for men compared with women. Medication spending for men exceeded that for women on average by 13.8% (95% CI 10.9; 16.7). The diagnoses with the highest prevalence were hypertension and heart failure. Women had a higher prevalence of diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, and hypertension. Medication costs were higher for men in three of five diagnoses and comparable for two diagnoses (diabetes and asthma). Women received more medication prescriptions than men, but on average prescriptions for men were 14%-26% more expensive than prescriptions for women. Regarding treatment patterns men were treated with different drug classes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with women. Total medication spending stratified by diagnosis was highest for diabetes.Gender differences for costs and prescribing patterns for chronic diseases vary disease specifically, but generally men had higher inpatient costs and more expensive medication prescriptions, whereas women had higher numbers of prescriptions."Heart	Outcomes	"Controversial results have been published concerning a possible gender survival difference in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).We analysed data from consecutive patients with stable CHF admitted to our department for prognostic evaluation. Patients underwent coronary angiography, echo-cardiography, radionuclide angiography and a cardiopulmonary exercise test.We included 613 consecutive patients of whom 115 (19%) were women. The major difference in clinical characteristics was a higher proportion of ischaemic cardiomyopathy in men compared to women (51% vs 28%, p<0.0001) and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (35+/-9 vs 38+/-9%, p=0.001). Therapeutic management was similar in men and women. A total of 140 cardiovascular-related deaths and 4 urgent transplantations occurred during a median follow-up of 1.234 days. There was no gender difference in cardiac survival. Cardiovascular mortality rates at 2 years were 11% in men and 13% in women.Despite a lower percentage of ischaemic cardiopathy in women, no gender survival benefit was found in our population of CHF patients receiving optimal medical therapy."Heart	Review	"Gender differences in the syndrome of heart failure (HF) occur in etiology and pathophysiology, in the clinical presentation and course of the syndrome. In addition, gender specific treatment responses and gender associated differences in the behavior of treating physicians are found. Hypertension and diabetes play a major role as causes of HF in women and both interact in their pathophysiology with the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Modulation of the RAS by estrogens explains specific differences between pre- and postmenopausal women and men. Myocardial growth processes and myocardial calcium handling are differentially regulated in female and male myocytes. Myocardial remodeling with age and as a consequence of mechanical load differs in women and men. For yet unknown reasons, HF with preserved systolic function seems to be more frequent in women than in men and the clinical course of systolic failure is different in both genders."Heart	Management	"Although several studies have shown the effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for advanced congestive heart failure (CHF), gender differences in utilization of CRT are not known.We used the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) to study national rates for admissions due to CHF along with procedures for initial CRT implantation, including both CRT-defibrillator (CRT-D) and CRT-pacemakers (CRT-P) during the years of 2002-2004. Chi-square tests were used for comparison between number of women and men. A P < 0.05 was considered significant.Women had consistently higher rates of admission for CHF during each year (574,037 (54%) vs 482,005 (46%), 2002; 601,181 (54%) vs 517,202 (46%), 2003; and 580,913 (53%) vs 521,280 (47%), 2004). The number of initial CRT device implantations (both CRT-D and CRT-P) was significantly lower during each year for women compared to men (659 (25%) vs 1,931 (75%), 2002; 6,928 (26%) vs 19,646 (74%), 2003; and 11,286 (27%) vs 42,196 (73%), 2004; P < 0.01 for all). Both CRT-P and CRT-D were used less frequently in women compared to men; however, this difference was consistently less prominent during each year with CRT-P compared to CRT-D (301 (41%) CRT-P vs 358 (19%) CRT-D, 2002; 659 (39%) CRT-P vs 2,530 (28%) CRT-D, 2003; and 2,891 (39%) CRT-P vs 8,395 (24%) CRT-D, 2004; P < 0.05).Our data clearly demonstrate a significant gender disparity in utilization of CRT devices. Further studies are needed to find possible reasons behind this disparity."Heart	Review	"Chronic heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the reason for more than one in five of all hospital admissions in patients aged >65 years. Major advances in the diagnosis and treatment of HF over the last two decades have proven effective in reducing morbidity and mortality among both men and women, but with less improvement for women and elderly patients. Women and men with HF differ in several respects. Women tend to be older and more often hypertensive, but are less likely to demonstrate any clinical evidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and more often have preserved ventricular function. Conversely, hypertension plays a greater role in the development of HF in women than in men. Sex differences in systolic and diastolic function in patients with hypertension have been demonstrated. Although men have higher incidence of HF at all ages, lifetime risk is similar in men and women because women live longer. Intervention studies have included far more men than women but in patients with reduced ventricular function there is no evidence to suggest that women benefit less than men from evidence-based treatments, and current guidelines do not differentiate between men and women. There is no consistent recent evidence that women receive poorer quality of care than men. Women with HF have better survival rates than men, which may be due to better systolic function or less CHD among women; however, mortality rates for HF are still very high regardless of sex. As most trials have been targeted towards patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which is less typical for women than for men with HF, more research is needed to help define treatment aimed at improving prognosis for patients with HF and preserved systolic function. In light of these differences and ongoing uncertainties, future European guidelines should incorporate gender issues. Heart Fail Monit 2008;6(1):34-40."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Women with systolic heart failure (HF) demonstrate better survival than men. Whether sex differences occur in hemodynamics or measures of left ventricular (LV) function is not well understood.We retrospectively analyzed a cohort who underwent evaluation by right heart catheterization +/- micromanometer-tipped catheterization of the LV. Two groups, defined at the time of catheterization, were studied: normal LV (NLV) function or HF (LV ejection fraction <35%, New York Heart Association II-III symptoms). For each female, we identified 2 male controls matched for age and LV ejection fraction in the HF group.In the NLV group, we matched 73 men (56 +/- 10 years) to 39 women (56 +/- 10 years). In the HF group, we matched 71 men (57 +/- 10 years) to 36 women (57 +/- 10 years). In the NLV group, women had higher heart rate and lower right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Left ventricular peak systolic pressure was higher, and LV end-diastolic pressure was lower in women. In the HF group, no sex differences were observed in any hemodynamic measurement. In both groups, no sex differences were observed in isovolumic contractility or relaxation.Sex differences in hemodynamics are observed in patients with NLV function but not with HF. The intrinsic or extrinsic factors responsible for sex differences observed in patients with NLV function may be eclipsed by the HF disease state or its treatment."Heart	Management	"Practice guidelines recommend implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy for patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% or less. The influence of sex and race on ICD use among eligible patients is unknown.To examine sex and racial differences in the use of ICD therapy.Observational analysis of 13,034 patients admitted with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% or less and discharged alive from hospitals in the American Heart Association's Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure quality-improvement program. Patients were treated between January 2005 and June 2007 at 217 participating hospitals.Use of ICD therapy or planned ICD therapy at discharge.Among patients eligible for ICD therapy, 4615 (35.4%) had ICD therapy at discharge (1614 with new ICDs, 527 with planned ICDs, and 2474 with prior ICDs). ICDs were used in 375 of 1329 eligible black women (28.2%), 754 of 2531 white women (29.8%), 660 of 1977 black men (33.4%), and 2356 of 5403 white men (43.6%) (P < .001). After adjustment for patient characteristics and hospital factors, the adjusted odds of ICD use were 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.88) for black men, 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.68) for white women, and 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.71) for black women, compared with white men. The differences were not attributable to the proportions of women and black patients at participating hospitals or to differences in the reporting of left ventricular ejection fraction.Less than 40% of potentially eligible patients hospitalized for heart failure received ICD therapy, and rates of use were lower among eligible women and black patients than among white men."Heart	Management	"Previous studies of sex differences in the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) predate recent expansions in Medicare coverage and did not provide patient follow-up over multiple years.To examine sex differences in ICD use for primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death.Analysis of a 5% national sample of research-identifiable files obtained from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the period 1991 through 2005. Patients were those aged 65 years or older with Medicare fee-for-service coverage and diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction and either heart failure or cardiomyopathy but no prior cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia (ie, the primary prevention cohort [n = 65,917 men and 70,504 women]), or with cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia (ie, the secondary prevention cohort [n = 52,252 men and 47,411 women]), from 1999 through 2005.Receipt of ICD therapy and all-cause mortality at 1 year.In the 2005 primary prevention cohort, 32.3 per 1000 men and 8.6 per 1000 women received ICD therapy within 1 year of cohort entry. In multivariate analyses, men were more likely than women to receive ICD therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.86-3.47). Among men and women alive at 180 days after cohort entry, the hazard of mortality in the subsequent year was not significantly lower among those who received ICD therapy (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.82-1.23). In the 2005 secondary prevention cohort, 102.2 per 1000 men and 38.4 per 1000 women received ICD therapy. Controlling for demographic variables and comorbid conditions, men were more likely than women to receive ICD therapy (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 2.30-2.59). Among men and women alive at 30 days after cohort entry, the hazard of mortality in the subsequent year was significantly lower among those who received ICD therapy (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.60-0.71).In the Medicare population, women are significantly less likely than men to receive ICD therapy for primary or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death."Heart	Outcomes	"Data regarding the influence of depression on outcome in chronic heart failure are conflicting and neglect possible gender differences.To investigate prevalence and prognostic importance of depression in a cohort of patients with symptomatic heart failure and to compare findings in males and females.Depression was measured at study entry using a self-reported 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) in 231 consecutive outpatients. The median follow-up time was 986 (IQR=664-1120) days.The prevalence of suspected major depression was 13% (minor depression, 17%) and was not different between the sexes. Major (but not minor) depression was associated with an increased mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR]=3.3, 95% confidence interval=1.8-6.1, p<0.001). This relationship remained significant after adjustment for other prognostically relevant factors as age, sex, heart failure aetiology, degree and type of left ventricular dysfunction, and New York Heart Association functional class. However, testing the effect of the interaction between gender and depression failed to reach significance (p=0.37).Our data confirm a high prevalence of depression in chronic heart failure. Further, they prove an independent prognostic impact of major, but not minor, depression. Possible gender differences regarding the prognostic impact of depression require further investigation in a larger patient cohort."Heart	Management	"Gender related differences in epidemiology, treatment, and prognosis of heart failure (HF) have been reported. We examined the sex influence in patients treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).Out of 334 consecutive HF patients (19.7% women) who underwent CRT, 195 patients reached clinical and echocardiographic evaluation at six and 12 months and were selected for analysis. A reduction in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume/m(2) (EDVi) and end systolic volume/m(2) (ESVi) was evident in the overall population at six months (P < 0.001) and from six to 12 months (P < 0.001). Compared to men, women showed significantly greater changes in LV volumes at mid (P < 0.05) and long-term (P < 0.001) follow-up and a significantly higher LV ejection fraction (EF) (40.8 +/- 12.3 vs 34.1 +/- 10.1, P < 0.01) at one year. Multiple regression analysis, including several demographic and clinical parameters, revealed that female gender is independently associated with greater reduction in LV ESVi. At the 12-month follow-up, the proportion of responders (defined in terms of ESV reduction by at least 10%) was higher in women than in men (76.1% vs 59.3%, P < 0.05).CRT induced a gender specific LV remodeling response."Heart	Management	"Specialized, multidisciplinary clinics improve service provision and reduce morbidity for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Although sex-related differences in access to cardiac health services have been reported, it remains unclear whether there are sex-related differences in the use of these specialized services.To evaluate possible sex-related differences in severity at entry into specialized, multidisciplinary clinics, and compare prescription patterns between male and female patients at these clinics.Data were obtained from the electronic clinical files of 765 CHF patients newly admitted to any of three main CHF clinics in Montreal, Quebec. Univariate and multivariate models were used to compare differences between sexes.Only 27.1% of patients were female. The mean age (+/- SD) of the women in the present study was similar to that of the men (64+/-16 years versus 65+/-13 years, respectively). Left ventricular ejection fraction at entry for patients with reduced systolic function was comparable between sexes. The New York Heart Association functional class at entry was similar among men and women with systolic dysfunction. However, among patients with preserved systolic function, women were more symptomatic, with a higher functional class at entry (adjusted OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.18 to 5.38). Prescription profiles were similar for men and women.Entry into a clinic may be delayed for women with preserved systolic function CHF. However, clinic referral patterns and disease management appeared to be similar among both men and women with systolic dysfunction CHF."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Clinical trials suggest females experience less heart failure (HF) progression, mortality, and arrhythmia frequency. HF increases Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) expression and activity contributing to both depressed contractility and ventricular arrhythmias, but whether gender modifies this effect is unknown. Left ventricular myocytes were isolated from control and from tachycardic pacing-induced failing swine hearts of both sexes. The Ni-sensitive NCX current (I(NCX)) was measured in voltage clamp after blocking other channels. In control myocytes there is no difference in basal I(NCX) and beta-adrenergic responsiveness between male and female animals. HF greatly increased I(NCX) and reduced beta-adrenergic responsiveness in males compared to females, an effect that was eliminated by PP1. Diuretic therapy (furosemide, 1 mg/kg/day) further enhanced I(NCX) and reduced beta-adrenergic responsiveness in females and eliminated the gender difference. Gender-specific differences in calcium handling may contribute to improved survival of females in HF."Heart	Management	"Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). We wish to determine whether there are sex-related differences in the optimal treatment of congestive heart failure.Using administrative databases, all patients >>=65 years of age discharged with a diagnosis of CHF between January 1998 and March 2003 and who filled a prescription for an ARB or an ACE inhibitor within 90 days of discharge were identified. Time to all-cause death in women and men on ACE inhibitors or ARBs was compared.There were 10,223 women (8627 ACE inhibitors and 1596 ARBs) and 9475 men (8484 ACE inhibitors and 991 ARBs). Hypertension was more common in women (50.1%) than men (33.1%). Women on ARBs had better survival than those on ACE inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59, 0.80). There was no difference in survival in men prescribed ARBs compared to ACE inhibitors (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95, 1.30).These sex differences in treatment-related outcome are important but should be confirmed in a randomized trial before ARBs are preferentially prescribed to women with CHF."Heart	2007 Jun-Jul	"In complying with required life style changes Heart Failure (HF) patients often depend on their partners. However providing care may cause burden and affect the health of these partners. The aim of this study was to investigate determinants of caregiver burden in order to identify caregivers who are at risk.Using a cross-sectional design, caregiver burden and potential determinants were measured in partners of HF patients. Demographic and clinical data were assessed in HF patients, partners completed questionnaires on caregiver burden (the Caregiver Reaction Assessment, CRA), caregiving tasks performed, physical and mental health status and quality of the marital relationship.In total 357 partners (75% female, mean age 67 years) participated. The physical health status of HF patients was only significantly associated with two domains of caregiver burden, 'disruption of daily schedule' (p<0.01) and 'loss of physical strength' (p<0.01). No associations were found with age, co-morbidity and LVEF. All domains of the CRA were mainly associated with the partner's own mental health (p<0.01) and with providing personal care to HF patients (p<0.01). Gender differences were only found with regard to the domain of 'feeling a lack of family support'.The assessment of caregiver burden should focus on the mental strength of partners. Furthermore when assistance in personal care is needed, additional support, either informal or professional, may be indicated."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Epidemiological studies have shown gender differences in the incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF); however, the role of estrogen in CHF is not known. We hypothesize that estrogen prevents cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the development of CHF.17Beta-estradiol (E2, 0.5 mg/60-day release) or placebo pellet was implanted subcutaneously into male G alpha q transgenic (Gq) mice. After 8 weeks, E2 treatment decreased the extent of cardiac hypertrophy and dilation and improved contractility in Gq mice. E2 treatment also attenuated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity and superoxide anion production via downregulation of Rac1. This correlated with reduced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes of Gq mice. The antioxidative properties of E2 were also associated with increased expression of thioredoxin (Trx), Trx reductases, and Trx reductase activity in the hearts of Gq mice. Furthermore, the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 and its downstream effectors, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, in the hearts of Gq mice was reduced by long-term E2 treatment. Indeed, E2 (10 nmol/L)-treated cardiomyocytes were much more resistant to angiotensin II-induced apoptosis. These antiapoptotic and cardioprotective effects of E2 were blocked by an estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780) and by a Trx reductase inhibitor (azelaic acid).These findings indicate that long-term E2 treatment improves CHF by antioxidative mechanisms that involve the upregulation of Trx and inhibition of Rac1-mediated attenuated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 /c-Jun N-terminal kinase/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that estrogen may be a useful adjunctive therapy for patients with CHF."Heart	Outcomes	"We wished to test previous hypotheses that sex-related differences in mortality and morbidity may be due to differences in the cause of heart failure or in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by comparing fatal and nonfatal outcomes in women and men with heart failure and a broad spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction.We compared outcomes in 2400 women and 5199 men randomized in the Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM) program using multivariable regression analyses. A total of 1188 women (50%) had a low LVEF (< or = 0.40), and 1212 had a preserved LVEF (> 0.40). Among the men, 3388 (65%) had a low LVEF, and 1811 had a preserved LVEF. A total of 1216 women (51%) and 3465 men (67%) had an ischemic cause of their heart failure. All-cause mortality was 21.5% in women and 25.3% in men (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.86; P<0.001). Fewer women (30.4%) than men (33.3%) experienced cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (adjusted HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.91; P<0.001). The risks of sudden death (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.85) and death due to worsening heart failure (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.89) were reduced to a comparable extent. The adjusted risk of cardiovascular hospitalization was also lower in women (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.95), mainly because of a reduced risk of heart failure hospitalization (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97). Women had a lower risk of death irrespective of cause of heart failure or LVEF.Among patients with heart failure, women have lower risks of most fatal and nonfatal outcomes that are not explained, as previously suggested, by LVEF or origin of the heart failure."Heart	Outcomes	"Physical and emotional symptoms are common in heart failure. These symptoms are theorized to affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL), but their impact is likely mediated by variables not yet explored. Moreover, gender may affect these relationships.To determine gender differences in the effects of physical and emotional symptom status on HRQOL.Data from 51 men and 47 women with heart failure were analyzed using regression analyses. There were no gender differences in physical or emotional symptom status, or HRQOL, but there were differences in the dynamic relationships among the variables. In bivariate analyses, physical and emotional symptom status was related to HRQOL in both men and women. However, in women, physical symptom status was related to HRQOL, while in men depression affected HRQOL in multivariate analyses (p<.001, r(2)=.27; p<.001, r(2)=.40, respectively). Functional status measured by the New York Heart Association functional class mediated the effects of anxiety and depression on HRQOL only in women.There were gender differences in the dynamic relationships among variables related to HRQOL. These results demonstrate the need for individualized, comprehensive evaluation of patient's HRQOL and symptom status in order to appropriately target interventions."Heart	Management	"Improved self-care behaviour is a goal in educational programmes for patients with heart failure, especially in regard to daily self-weighing and salt and fluid restriction.The objectives of the present study were to: (1) describe self-care with special regard to daily self-weighing and salt and fluid restriction in patients with heart failure in primary health care, during one year of monthly telephone follow-up after a single session education, (2) to describe gender differences in regard to self-care and (3) to investigate if self-care was associated with health-related quality of life.The present analysis is a subgroup analysis of a larger randomised trial. After one intensive educational session, a primary health care nurse evaluated 60 patients (mean age 79 years, 52% males, 60% in New York Heart Association class III-IV) by monthly telephone follow-up during 12 months.The intervention had no effect on quality of life measured by EuroQol 5D and no significant associations were found between quality of life and self-care behaviour. Self-care behaviour measured by The European Self-care Behaviour Scale remained unchanged throughout the study period. No significant gender differences were shown but women had a tendency to improve adherence to daily weight control between 3- and 12 months.The self-care behaviour and quality of life in patients with heart failure did not change during one year of monthly telephone follow-up after a single session education and this indicates a need for more extensive interventions to obtain improved self-care behaviour in these patients."Heart	Review	"In cardiovascular diseases e.g. heart failure and coronary artery disease gender differences are evident in etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, prognosis and response to treatment. Diabetes and hypertension are the major risk factors in women. Mechanisms leading to apparent diabetes or its clinical pre-stage are different in women and men and according to this result in different therapeutic implications. Diastolic heart failure is more frequent in women and effects and side effects of important groups of active pharmaceutical substances are, at least to some extent, different. Atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmia differ in frequency of occurrence; drug induced tachycardia with QT interval prolongation is particularly frequent in women. Underlying pathomechanisms responsible for gender differences in pharmacotherapy are on the one hand differences in pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Particularly drugs which are metabolised via cytochrome P 450 CYP 3A pathway show different kinetics in women and men. In addition, important differences are evident in pharmocodynamics caused by effects of sex steroid hormones or products of X-chromosomal genes. The evidence of estrogen and testosterone receptors in cardiomyocytes and the vascular system, interaction of sex steroid hormones with cellular pathways and the role of X-chromosomal genes are the focus of basic research. Interactions of sex steroid hormone receptors with other nuclear receptors e.g. PPARs (""peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors"") are another important underlying mechanism. The knowledge of different pharmacokinetic mechanisms has to be taken into consideration in pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular diseases, for example by adjustment of drug dosages in women, necessary in different groups of pharmaceutical substances or in the long run, gender differences in effects and side effects of drugs. In drug development both aspects have to be considered. There is more than one good reason to intensify basic and clinical research and research on health care on gender differences in cardiovascular diseases."Heart	Clinical	"Osteoprotegerin, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, has pleiotropic effects on bone metabolism, endocrine function, and the immune system. Myocardial expression and circulating levels of osteoprotegerin are increased in heart failure. The relationship between osteoprotegerin levels in the general population and indices of left ventricular structure and function is unknown. Plasma osteoprotegerin levels and cardiac MRI indices of left ventricular structure and function were available in 2715 subjects (median age: 44 years; 45% male) enrolled in the Dallas Heart Study. The associations between osteoprotegerin concentration and indices of left ventricular structure and function were assessed by linear regression analysis, adjusting for possible confounders. By gender-specific linear regression analysis, higher osteoprotegerin levels were significantly associated with higher left ventricular mass, left ventricular wall thickness, left ventricular concentricity index, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (P<0.001 for all). After adjustment for age, race, fat-free mass, fat mass, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypercholesterolemia, smoking status, hormone replacement therapy, coronary artery calcium score >10, and presence of aortic plaque, osteoprotegerin remained significantly associated with each of these left ventricular indices among male subjects (P<0.05 for each). Among female subjects, higher osteoprotegerin was independently associated with higher left ventricular end-systolic volume and lower ejection fraction (P<0.0001 for each) but not with indices of left ventricular hypertrophy. These findings are compatible with the theory that osteoprotegerin may play a pathophysiological role in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction."Heart	Epidemiology	"The prevalence of congestive heart failure (CHF) is increasing with the aging of the community. Management of patients with systolic dysfunction (SD) is important for prevention of CHF, but there is little information regarding the burden of SD on Japanese communities.In order to delineate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SD patients, the medical records of patients from Sado Island were collected and summarized in 2003. From the 5 years prior to 2003, data for 497 patients were extracted. The mortality rate was significantly higher compared with the general population; and the total number of survivors had decreased to 410 by 2003. The proportion of SD patients in the general population increased sharply after the age of 65 years in males and 70 years in females, reaching 3.3% and 1.7% for men and women, respectively, in their 80 s. In 49% of the patients, the Charlson comorbidity index was > or = 2, whereas 24% of females led a solitary life.The total count of outpatients with SD is progressively increasing with age. These patients have multiple comorbidities, making the outcome of SD a poor one. The gender difference in disease characteristics and living conditions should be taken into consideration when establishing preventive strategies for CHF in Japanese communities."Heart	Review	"Heart failure (HF) has traditionally been divided into HF with a reduced ejection fraction (EF; systolic HF) and HF with a normal EF (diastolic HF). Both groups have reductions in exercise tolerance, neurohumoral activation, and abnormal left ventricular (LV) filling dynamics and impaired relaxation. Although the normal EF indicates that pump performance is adequately compensated, some of the patients with HF and a normal EF have reduced longitudinal systolic velocity indicating cardiac muscular contractile dysfunction. Regardless of EF, the severity of HF and its prognosis and degree of exercise intolerance are closely related to the degree of diastolic filling abnormalities. Patients with HF and a reduced EF have ventricular dilatation and elongated myocytes, whereas patients with HF and a normal EF do not. Thus, patients with HF have diastolic abnormalities regardless of EF and many patients with HF and a normal EF have contractile abnormalities despite preserved systolic pump performance. Heart failure with a normal EF and a reduced EF differs in the systolic LV pump performance and the type of remodeling. The mechanism of the differing remodeling responses is not known, but aging, sex differences, and diabetes may contribute."Heart	Review	"Heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HF-NEF) is frequently believed to be more common in women than in men. However, the interaction of gender and age has rarely been analyzed in detail, and knowledge of the distinction between pre- and postmenopausal women is lacking. Some of the studies that have described a higher prevalence of HF-NEF in women relied on clinical diagnoses of HF together with normal systolic function and did not measure diastolic function. This applies to the analysis of patients hospitalized for HF and some epidemiological investigations that agree on the greater prevalence of HF-NEF in women. Population-based studies with echocardiographic determination of diastolic function have suggested equal or greater prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in men. Major risk factors for HF-NEF include hypertension, aging, obesity, diabetes, and ischemia. Hypertension is more frequent in women and can contribute to left ventricular and arterial stiffening in a gender-specific way. Aging, obesity, and diabetes affect myocardial and vascular stiffness differently and lead to different forms of myocardial hypertrophy in women and men. In contrast, ischemia may play a greater role in men. Gender differences in ventricular diastolic distensibility, in vascular stiffness and ventricular/vascular coupling, in skeletal muscle adaptation to HF, and in the perception of symptoms may contribute to a greater rate of HF-NEF in women. The underlying molecular mechanisms include gender differences in calcium handling, in the NO system, and in natriuretic peptides. Estrogen affects collagen synthesis and degradation and inhibits the renin-angiotensin system. Effects of estrogen may provide benefit to premenopausal women, and the loss of its protective mechanisms may render the heart of postmenopausal women more vulnerable. Thus, a number of molecular mechanisms can contribute to the gender differences in HF-NEF."Heart	Review	"Biomarkers are used in medicine to facilitate diagnosis, assess risk, direct therapy and determine efficacy of treatment. Sensitivity and specificity are essential in order for a biomarker to be useful. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are considered biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. However, they differ in function, sensitivity and specificity. BNP is released from the myocardium in response to myocardial stretch, a clear cause and effect relationship; therefore, it is useful in the diagnosis of heart failure when patients present with dyspnea of unknown origin and to assess treatment in high risk patients with diagnosed heart failure. Sex and age based reference ranges and partition values are established from clinical trials and from populations screened for the absence of cardiovascular disease. Highly sensitive and reproducible methods are also available to measure CRP. However, although CRP is associated with adverse cardiovascular events, unlike BNP, multiple stimuli increase production of CRP. Therefore, elevation in CRP is not specific to cardiovascular disease. Partition values for CRP and cardiovascular risk based on epidemiological studies predict risk for populations but may not always be useful when used alone to predict individual risk or to direct therapy. Given the non-specific stimuli which affect circulating concentrations of CRP, using CRP to monitor treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk may provide little benefit without understanding or targeting the underlying causes for its elevation."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Recent studies have identified sex differences in heart function that may affect the risk of developing heart failure. We hypothesized that there are fundamental differences in calcium (Ca) regulation in cardiac myocytes of males and premenopausal females. Isometric force transients (n = 45) were measured at various stimulation frequencies to define the force frequency responses (FFR) (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 Hz) during either changes in bath Ca ([Ca]o) (1.0, 1.75, 3.5, and 7.0 mM) or length-tension (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% L(max)) in right ventricle trabeculae from normal male (MT) and premenopausal female (FT) cats. Force-Ca measurements were also obtained in chemically skinned trabeculae. Under basal conditions (0.5 Hz, 1.75 mM Ca, 80% L(max)) both MT and FT achieved similar developed forces (DF) (MT 11 +/- 1, FT = 10 +/- 1 mN/mm2). At low rates and lengths, there is no sex difference. At higher preloads and rates, there is a separation in DF in MT and FT. At basal [Ca]o both MT and FT exhibited positive FFR (2.0 Hz, 1.75 mM Ca: MT 38 +/- 3, FT 21 +/- 4 mN/mm2); however, at higher [Ca]o, MT achieved greater DF (2.0 Hz, 7.0 mM Ca: MT 40 +/- 3 and FT = 24 +/- 4 mN/mm2). We detected no sex difference in myofilament Ca sensitivity at a sarcomere length of 2.1 mum. However, rapid cooling contractures indicated greater sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca load in MT at higher frequencies. Despite virtually identical contractile performance under basal conditions, significant sex differences emerge under conditions of increased physiological stress. Given the lack of sex differences in myofilament Ca sensitivity, these studies suggest fundamental sex differences in cellular Ca regulation to achieve contractile reserve, with myocardium from males exhibiting higher SR Ca load."Heart	Outcomes	"Poor prognosis in heart failure (HF) patients with diabetes is often attributed to increased co-morbidity and advanced disease. Further, this effect may be worse in women.To determine whether the effect of diabetes on outcomes and the sex-related variation persisted in a propensity score-matched HF population, and whether the sex-related variation was a function of age.Of the 7788 HF patients in the Digitalis Investigation Group trial, 2218 had a history of diabetes. Propensity score for diabetes was calculated for each patient using a non-parsimonious logistic regression model incorporating all measured baseline covariates, and was used to match 2056 (93%) diabetic patients with 2056 non-diabetic patients.All-cause mortality occurred in 135 (25%) and 216 (39%) women without and with diabetes (adjusted HR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.34 to 2.08; p<0.001). Among men, 535 (36%) and 609 (41%) patients without and with diabetes died from all causes (adjusted HR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.36; p = 0.002). Sex-diabetes interaction (overall adjusted p<0.001) was only significant in patients > or = 65 years (15% absolute risk increase in women; multivariable p for interaction = 0.005), but not in younger patients (2% increase in women; p for interaction = 0.173). Risk-adjusted HR (95% CI) for all-cause hospitalisation for women and men were 1.49 (1.28 to 1.72) and 1.21 (1.11 to 1.32), respectively, also with significant sex-diabetes interaction (p = 0.011).Diabetes-associated increases in morbidity and mortality in chronic HF were more pronounced in women, and theses sex-related differences in outcomes were primarily observed in elderly patients."Heart	Management	"Little is known about the differences between natriuretic peptides used to evaluate elderly patients with heart failure. The aim of the study was to evaluate the information and the power to predict cardiovascular mortality derived from an analysis of cardiac natriuretic peptides from the same study population and at the same time.In all, 415 elderly patients (age 65-82 years) in primary health care were evaluated and followed for 6 years. All patients had symptoms of heart failure and were examined by a cardiologist. An electrocardiogram and chest x-rays were taken, and the systolic and diastolic functions were assessed using Doppler echocardiography. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal proBNP, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and N-terminal proANP were analyzed. All 4 peptides were associated with age, and only 1 of them showed any gender difference. Three of the 4 peptides (not ANP) provided important information for identifying patients with impaired systolic function and diastolic dysfunction (pseudonormal or restrictive filling pattern), and for assessing the risk of cardiovascular death.Cardiac natriuretic peptides are useful tools for evaluating elderly patients with heart failure. Three of the 4 peptides were very similar. ANP exhibits inferior properties and cannot be recommended in clinical practice."Heart	Outcomes	"This study sought to explore the gender-related differences in etiology and outcomes in chronic heart failure (HF) patients from 5 randomized trials.Each year, 550,000 new cases of HF are identified; however, there remain limited data on gender-related differences in etiology and outcomes among patients with HF with systolic dysfunction.We analyzed data from 8,791 men and 2,851 women randomized in 5 clinical trials (PRAISE [Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation], PRAISE-2, MERIT-HF [Metoprolol Extended Release Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure], VEST [Vesnarinone Trial], and PROMISE [Prospective Randomized Milrinone Survival Evaluation]) to explore gender-related differences in etiology (ischemic vs. nonischemic) and outcomes (all-cause mortality and death or all-cause hospitalization). Hazard ratios (HR), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated by gender and etiology.A total of 18% of ischemic and 31% of nonischemic patients were women. Irrespective of etiology, women were older, more ethnically diverse, and had higher systolic blood pressures, more diabetes, and severe HF symptoms, but less often smoked or had prior myocardial infarctions than men. Mean ejection fractions were similar between women (23.6%) and men (23.2%). The 1-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimates varied by gender and etiology (female nonischemics, HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.85 to 0.89]; female ischemics, HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.81 to 0.85]; male nonischemics, HR 0.84 [95% CI 0.83 to 0.85]; male ischemics, HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.78 to 0.81]). After adjustment, female gender (HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.69 to 0.85]) and nonischemic etiology (HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.72 to 0.89]) were associated with longer survival time. Time to death or hospitalization was longer among nonischemics (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.78 to 0.89], p < 0.0001); however, female gender was not significantly associated with the composite outcome (HR 1.01 [95% CI 0.95 to 1.08]).Our data clarify that outcomes differ by both gender and etiology among patients with HF with systolic dysfunction. Understanding these differences may lead to better management of HF patients and improved overall prognosis."Heart	Epidemiology	"Understanding the influence of gender in heart failure allows for better treatment. This study described the gender differences in heart failure patients and their response to therapy.Consecutive patients (116 men vs. 52 women) from 1997 to 2002 were recruited from a single heart failure unit. Mean follow-up was 40+/-19 months.Mean age was 68+/-12 years; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 27+/-12%. Women had higher mean LVEF, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and worse New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class at baseline compared to men, while age, body mass index, blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate and other co-morbidities did not differ significantly. Fewer women remained on angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors while angiotensin-II-receptor blockers use increased significantly. By the end of the study, both genders exhibited similar magnitude of improvements in LVEF, cardiac dimensions, hemodynamics and mean NYHA functional class. In multivariate analysis, NYHA functional class was the strongest predictor of mortality: patients with NYHA class III/IV at baseline had 2.4-fold increased mortality risk compared to those in NYHA class I/II (95% CI 1.09-5.51, p=0.03). For men, functional class at baseline was the strongest predictor of mortality while for women, it was age at baseline.In a contemporary tertiary referral heart failure clinic, women were observed to have better LVEF, but worse NYHA functional class than men. Both genders exhibited functional and hemodynamic improvements with only minor differences in their medical therapies. Predictors of mortality differed between the genders."Heart	Outcomes	"Heart failure (HF) is associated with poor outcome after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Women have higher mortality rate than men after AMI, however, it is unknown whether women with HF after AMI have different prognosis than men.To compare the prognosis of men and women with AMI and mild-moderate HF.We analyzed data of 3456 consecutive patients with AMI hospitalized in all cardiac care units in Israel during two nationwide surveys.Among patients with AMI and HF on admission: women were older, had more risk factors, and were less likely to undergo percutaneous coronary angiography/intervention. Women with HF had higher (7-days, 30-days, and 1-year) crude mortality rates than men. However, adjusted mortality rates were not significantly different between genders.Women with AMI complicated by HF had higher crude mortality rate than men that was eliminated after multivariate analysis, suggesting that the higher mortality rate may be attributed to increased prevalence of risk factors and lower rate of revascularization and medical therapies among women. Women with AMI and HF should be considered as a high-risk subgroup with adverse outcome. It remains to be determined whether more intensive management will improve their prognosis."Heart	Management	"The progressive and demanding nature of heart failure has a significant impact on the daily life of all individuals. Gender-related differences exist in diagnosis, management and home-based support, whereby women's needs have been either managed less aggressively or overlooked. Minimal research has been conducted on the everyday challenges for women who are living in the community with heart failure. The researchers of this interpretive research encouraged the seven women who volunteered for this study to talk about their day-to-day challenges. The interviews were interpreted through a process informed by Heideggerian hermeneutics, whereby the three themes of recalibrating time and space, balancing pathways of wishing and hoping and practicality, and acknowledging loss in persevering through uncertainty were uncovered. The findings of this research may be utilized in assisting and preparing women to think and plan ahead by considering some decisions others make while taking on a new path in responding to the symptoms associated with heart failure."Heart	Clinical	"Few studies are published on heart failure patients in primary health care, in elderly in advanced age.The purpose of this study was to examine the accuracy of the diagnosis of heart failure in all men and women with focus on age and gender.The patients were recruited from one selected primary health care in the city of SkellefteÃ¥, Sweden. The general practitioners included all patients who had symptoms and signs indicating heart failure. The patients were then referred for an echocardiographic examination and a final cardiology consultation.The general practitioners identified 121 women and 49 men with suspected heart failure of whom 39% (51 women and 16 men) were above 80 years. Women were significantly older than men (mean age 78 and 75 years, respectively, p = 0.03). The main symptom was dyspnoea (80%). Confirmed heart failure was verified in 45% of the patients and was significantly more common in men than women (p = 0.02). Of all men and women above 80 years, 75% and 22%, respectively (p = 0.01) had a verified systolic heart failure, while there were no significant gender differences in patients younger than 80. In a multivariate regression analysis taking gender, age, smoking, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, angina, myocardial infarction and diabetes into account, myocardial infarction (OR = 4.3, CL = 1.8-10.6) hypertension (OR = 3.4, CI = 1.6-6.9) atrial fibrillation (OR = 2.8, CL = 1.0-7.9) remained significantly predictive of a confirmed diagnosis of heart failure.This study showed the difficulty of diagnosing heart failure accurately based only on clinical symptoms, especially in women above 80 years."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Data from population-based studies indicate that men have a higher incidence and worse prognoses of congestive heart failure than women. Echocardiography was used to compare left ventricular (LV) myocardial and chamber contractility between 490 male and 861 female American Indian participants in the second Strong Heart Study examination. After adjusting for fat-free mass, baseline hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and alcohol consumption, LV ejection fractions were higher in women than men (66 +/- 8% vs 63 +/- 9%, p = 0.002), as were stress-corrected mid-wall shortening (106 +/- 13% vs 104+/-15%, p = 0.006) and the circumferential end-systolic stress/end-systolic volume index (7.1 x 10(4) +/- 1.9 x 10(4) vs 6.5 x 10(4) +/- 2.1 x 10(4) kdyne/cm3, all p values <0.001). LV ejection fractions were less than the predefined partition value in 4.7% of women and in 16.7% of men (odds ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.34, p <0.001). Stress-corrected mid-wall shortening was less than the predetermined lower limit of normal in 2.9% of women and in 6.2% of men (odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.70, p <0.001). There was no significant gender difference in supranormal function by either measure of LV systolic function. Estimated mean independent effects of female gender were a 3% greater ejection fraction, 2.7% greater stress-corrected mid-wall shortening, and a 0.4 x 10(4) kdyne/cm3 greater circumferential end-systolic stress/end-systolic volume index. In conclusion, in a population-based sample aged 45 to 74 years, women had greater LV myocardial and chamber function than men. Gender-specific partition values for measures of LV systolic function may be necessary to detect abnormal contractility in clinical and epidemiologic studies."Heart	Management	"Gender differences in physical and psychological health and responses in persons receiving implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) have been reported but are not well delineated. This study examined symptoms of pain and sleep difficulties, functional status, and psychological responses in 180 (75%) men and 60 (25%) women before and immediately following their first ICD implantation. Women were significantly younger, less likely to be married, and had less history of coronary artery disease than men. Forty-eight percent of women were New York Heart Association class III-IV vs. 27% of men (p<0.05). Women had lower functional status and were more likely to report symptoms of increased pain severity and sleep difficulties. Differences in functional status and pain were reduced after adjusting for New York Heart Association class and age, respectively. There were no differences in depressive symptoms or anxiety. Clinical implications of gender-related responses include the need to address symptoms of heart failure as well as increased pain and sleep difficulties in women at the time surrounding ICD implantation. Longitudinal studies and gender-focused nursing interventions should be developed to promote better understanding of responses and to improve recovery outcomes for ICD patients."Heart	Management	"Despite the importance of the sodium-restricted diet (SRD) to heart failure (HF) management, patient adherence is poor. Little is known about gender differences in adherence or factors that affect patients' ability to follow SRD recommendations. The purposes of this study were to determine whether there were gender differences in (1) adherence to the SRD; (2) knowledge about SRD and HF self-care; and (3) perceived barriers to following the SRD.Forty-one men and 27 women completed the Heart Failure Attitudes and Barriers questionnaire that measured HF self-care, knowledge, and perceived barriers to follow an SRD. Diet adherence was measured by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (UNa). Women were more adherent to the SRD than men as reflected by 24-hour urine excretion (2713 versus 3859 mg UNa, P = .01). Women recognized signs of excess sodium intake such as fluid buildup (P = .001) and edema (P = .01) more often than men and had better understanding of appropriate actions to take related to following an SRD. There were no gender differences in perceived barriers to follow an SRD.Although men and women perceived similar barriers, women were more adherent to the SRD and had greater knowledge about following an SRD. Further investigation of this phenomenon is warranted to determine if better adherence contributes to improved outcomes in women."Heart	Review	"With the rapid advancements in heart failure device therapy, many physicians now use these devices in everyday clinical practice. However, questions remain regarding the clinical benefit of these therapies in different patient subgroups. Since the majority of patients enrolled in device trials are white men, extrapolating the data to specific patient subpopulations becomes important. Specifically, the question of clinical outcomes in women with implantable device therapy for prevention of sudden cardiac death and management of heart failure is an important clinical issue. In this article, we review the data on survival and clinical outcomes with heart failure device therapy (implantable cardioverter defibrillators [ICDs] and cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT]) and analyze the results from clinical trials for any differences in outcomes based on gender. Even though women are a significantly under-represented population with regard to clinical investigation and utilization of heart failure devices, they still derive the same morbidity and mortality benefits compared to men. Specifically, ICD devices confer the same rates of sudden cardiac death prevention, and CRT devices improve CHF morbidity and mortality at rates comparable to those found in men. These results support equal use of ICDs and CRT in men and women."Heart	Management	"We examined whether B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels allow gender-specific risk stratification in patients with acute dyspnea.B-type natriuretic peptide levels determined in patients with heart failure correlate with the severity of disease and prognosis. Gender differences in risk prediction are poorly examined.The BASEL (B-type natriuretic peptide for Acute Shortness of Breath Evaluation) Study enrolled 190 female and 262 male patients presenting with acute dyspnea.At 24 months, cumulative mortality was comparable in women and men (38% vs. 35%, p = 0.66). Cox regression analyses revealed that BNP levels >500 pg/ml indicated a 5.1-fold increase in mortality for women (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0 to 8.5, p < 0.001) versus a 1.8-fold increase in men (95% CI 1.2 to 2.6; p = 0.007). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for BNP to predict death was significantly higher in female (AUC: 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.86) than in male patients (AUC: 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.71; p = 0.001 for the comparison of AUC(women) versus AUC(men)). Women with BNP >500 pg/ml displayed a higher mortality as compared with men with BNP >500 pg/ml (68% vs. 46%, p = 0.015). Interaction analysis showed that BNP is a stronger predictor of death in women than in men (p = 0.008).B-type natriuretic peptide plasma levels seem to be stronger predictors of death in women than in men."Heart	Outcomes	"Risk factors for mortality in community-residing persons developing congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may differ for males and females.Persons from the Groningen Longitudinal Aging Study with incident CHF (N=274) or AMI (N=198) were identified between 1993 and 1998 and their survival status was collected in 2001. Risk factors are assessed prior to the cardiac diagnosis.The 1-, 5-, 7-year survival rates were 65, 53, 50% for AMI and 74, 45, 32% for CHF. Multivariate analyses showed that male gender, high age, smoking, diabetes and low physical function were risk factors for mortality among persons with CHF. For AMI, 1 month mortality was related to high age and baseline low body mass index, while longer term mortality was related to male gender and high age. In addition, diabetes increased longer term mortality among females but not among males with AMI. Depression was not a risk factor for mortality for either condition in either gender.Males with CHF or AMI have worse survival rates compared to females. Risk factors for mortality are predominantly similar for males and females, except for diabetes which is a risk factor among females, but not males with AMI."Heart	Outcomes	"Little is known about sex differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes in patients with acute congestive heart failure (CHF).This prospective observational study evaluated gender differences among 217 consecutive patients (124 men and 93 women) presenting with acute CHF to the emergency department. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Women were older, and had less pulmonary comorbidity, but more noticeable jugular venous distension, as well as higher diastolic blood pressure and troponin level at presentation. Among contributing causes of acute CHF, myocardial ischaemia and anaemia were more frequent in women. Adequate medical CHF therapy was initiated more rapidly in women. Initial resource utilisation, time to discharge, and mortality were similar. Important differences to the disadvantage of women were noted during long-term follow-up. Mean cumulative survival was 619 (95% CI, 533-705) days in women as compared with 669 (95% CI, 601-737; p = 0.0663) in men. However, after multivariate adjustment female sex was not an independent predictor of long-term mortality (hazard ratio 1.14, 95% CI, 0.68-1.90; p = 0.619). Total spending for treatment cost was 11,858 US dollars University of Basel, University Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Switzerland (95% CI, 8921-14794) in women compared to 15,965 US dollars (95% CI, 12328-18003; p = 0.115) in men after 1 year. Functional status was similar in women and men at 6 and 12 months.The trend towards lower survival in women seems primarily related to higher age and other factors rather than gender itself. Female sex is not an independent predictor of long-term mortality in acute CHF."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Aortic valve regurgitation (AR) can result in heart failure from chronic overloading of the left ventricle. As little is known of gender-specific responses of the left ventricle to this condition, the study aim was to compare left ventricular (LV) remodeling in male and female rats with severe AR. In order to assess the impact of estrogens on LV remodeling in AR, the effect of ovariectomy (OVX) was also evaluated.AR was created in adult Wistar rats (females (control or OVX) and males). Animals were followed for 26 weeks and compared to sham-operated groups. Heart function was evaluated in vivo using echocardiography, and the hearts were subsequently harvested for tissue analysis.The LV ejection fraction was decreased similarly in both sexes. Despite similar echocardiographic AR severity, females had higher indexed cardiac output and the largest increase in LV weight, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and eccentric remodeling. No differences were observed between control and OVX females. Ovariectomy had no significant impact on any of the parameters monitored.Female rats developed more LV remodeling in response to chronic AR than males. AR appears to impose a greater LV workload on females due to their smaller body and heart size. Hormonal status did not have any impact on LV remodeling in this experimental model."Heart	Management	"This paper provides important insights on gender differences across racial and ethnic groups in a Medicare population in terms of the quality of care received for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and congestive heart failure (CHF) in association with diabetes or hypertension/end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Both race/ethnicity and gender are associated with differences in the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of Medicare recipients with these conditions. In the AMI group, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients of both genders were less likely to receive aspirin or beta-blockers than non-Hispanic Whites. These differences persisted for Hispanic women and men even when they presented with ESRD or diabetes. Rates for smoking cessation counseling were among the lowest among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics with AMI-diabetes and non-Hispanic blacks with AMI-hypertension/ESRD. Gender comparisons within racial groups for the AMI and AMI-diabetes groups show that among non-Hispanic Whites, women were less likely to receive aspirin and beta-blockers. No gender differences were noted among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic Medicare recipients. In the CHF group, Hispanics were the racial/ethnic group least likely to have an assessment of left ventricular function (LVF), even if they had diabetes and had lower rates of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy or even if they had combined CHF-hypertension/ESRD. Gender comparisons in both the CHF and CHF-hypertension/ESRD groups show that non-Hispanic White women were less likely to have an LVF assessment than non-Hispanic White men. Among all subjects, having comorbidities with AMI was not associated with higher markers of quality cardiovascular care. Closing the many gaps in cardiovascular care must target the specific needs of women and men across racial and ethnic groups."Heart	Management	"The impact of gender differences has not been well described in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).Through review of medical records, data on characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed on 105,388 patient records according to gender. Women accounted for 52% of these admissions and were older than men (74.5 versus 70.1 years,) and more commonly had preserved left ventricular function (51% versus 28%). Based on history, women were less likely to have coronary artery disease (51% versus 64%) and its risk factors, but more commonly had hypertension (76% versus 70%). Both genders received similar intravenous diuretic regimens, but fewer women received vasoactive therapy (24% vs 31%). Evidence-based oral therapies were underused in both genders. Women consistently received less procedure-oriented therapy. Mean length of stay (women 5.9, men 5.8 days) and the risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.974 [0.910-1.042], P = .4390) were similar in both genders.More women than men are hospitalized with ADHF. Heart failure with preserved left ventricular function predominates in women. Though women are treated less aggressively, treatment gaps exists in both sexes. Despite these differences, length of stay and in-hospital mortality rates are similar."Heart	Review	"Recent articles have inquired about the quality of care for women presenting with cardiovascular disease. The Cooperative Cardiovascular Project and the National Heart Failure Project, 2 Medicare databases, provide national data to address concerns that women receive poorer quality care than men. In these databases, sex was not independently associated with the use of beta-blockers, assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction, or use of fibrinolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (MI), nor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prescription for heart failure. Women with MI were slightly less likely to receive aspirin and slightly more likely to receive ACE inhibitors. Among patients with equivocal indications, men were significantly more likely than women to undergo cardiac catheterization, whereas there were no sex differences among patients with strong indication. Women were more likely than men to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention and less likely to receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Short-term mortality rates after MI and readmission rates after heart failure did not vary significantly by gender; however, risk of mortality after heart failure was slightly lower for women. Within multivariate models, gender differences in treatment were small and in many cases insignificant. These national datasets fail to reveal a strong sex bias in treatment among patients aged > or = 65 years."Heart	Pathophysiology	"The activity of the human cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) changes according to gender. The present study evaluated the effect of gender on the influence of carvedilol on serum digoxin levels in patients with heart failure.Twenty-four patients (12 female and 12 male) with New York Heart Association class II-III heart failure were included in the study. Patients were taking oral digoxin (0.0625-0.25 mg, once a day) and were administered oral carvedilol (6.25 mg, two times daily) for 7 days.In the male group, carvedilol led to statistically significant increases in the area under the concentration time curve to 16 h (AUC(0-16h)) and the peak concentration (C(max)) for digoxin, with no change in time to peak (t(max))(AUC(0-16h)= 24.1+/-9.2 ng.h/ml vs. 15.4+/-5.8 ng.h/ml, p<0.001, C(max)=2.2+/-1.0 ng/ml vs. 1.6+/-0.6 ng/ml, p<0.01, t(max)=2.4+/-2.2 h vs. 2.1+/-1.0 h, p>0.05). In the female group, carvedilol administration did not cause statistically significant change in the AUC(0-16h), C(max), or t(max) for digoxin (p>0.05). In the male group, carvedilol resulted in a significant increase in the AUC(0-16h) and C(max) for digoxin compared with the female group (AUC(0-16h)=24.1+/- 9.2ng.h/ml vs. 17.0+/-6.8 ng.h/ml, C(max)=2.2+/-1.0 ng/ml vs. 1.5+/-0.6 ng/ml, p<0.05, respectively).Men seem to have a higher activity relative to women for the drug efflux transporter P-gp. Our results suggest that carvedilol will cause drug interaction with digoxin following the inhibition of P-gp-mediated transcellular transport of digoxin in males."Heart	Management	"To determine whether a sex-based difference in digoxin pharmacokinetics exists in patients receiving long-term digoxin therapy for chronic heart failure or atrial fibrillation.Single-center, retrospective review of medical records.University-based teaching hospital and outpatient clinic.Sixty-seven adults (32 men, 35 women) with chronic heart failure or atrial fibrillation who were receiving digoxin therapy.Serum digoxin concentrations and daily digoxin doses were obtained from patients' medical records. Daily doses were adjusted for patients' actual and ideal body weight and body mass index (BMI). The ratio between the serum digoxin concentration and each of the adjusted daily doses of digoxin was compared between men and women. The mean +/- SD serum digoxin concentration was 0.85 +/- 0.51 ng/ml for men compared with 1.02 +/- 0.51 ng/ml for women. Mean +/- SD unadjusted doses of digoxin were 0.180 +/- 0.063 and 0.164 +/- 0.059 mg/day for men and women, respectively; the difference was not statistically significant. Ratios of serum digoxin concentration to daily digoxin doses did not differ by sex when doses were estimated with actual or ideal weight. Only the ratio of the digoxin concentration to the BMI-adjusted dose was significantly different between men and women (0.14 +/- 0.09 and 0.19 +/- 0.11, respectively, p<0.05).Sex-based differences in digoxin pharmacokinetics were absent when actual or ideal body weight was used. However, the ratio of serum digoxin concentration to daily digoxin dose adjusted for BMI differed by sex. Because digoxin is distributed to lean body mass, use of the BMI could have overadjusted body weight, leading to inaccurate pharmacokinetic assumptions and calculations. The pharmacokinetics of digoxin do not appear to differ by sex."Heart	Outcomes	"To evaluate the effects of a single-session, interactive computer-based educational program on knowledge, compliance and quality of life in heart failure patients with special emphasis on gender differences.One hundred and fifty-four patients, mean age 70 years, from five heart failure clinics were randomised to either receiving only standard education (n=72) or standard education and additional computer-based education (n=82).Knowledge was increased in both groups after 1 month with a trend towards higher knowledge (P=0.07) in the computer-based group. The increase in knowledge was significantly higher in the computer-based group after 6 months (P=0.03). No differences were found between the groups with regard to compliance with treatment and self-care or quality of life. The women had significantly lower quality of life and did not improve after 6 months as the men did (P=0.0001).Computer-based education gave increased knowledge about heart failure.Computers can be a useful tool in heart failure education, but to improve compliance a single-session educational intervention is not sufficient. Gender differences in learning and quality of life should be further evaluated."Heart	Outcomes	"Patients with heart failure (HF) and preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF) constitute up to 30% to 50% of patients with HF, and HF-PEF affects women more often than men. Not much is known about the role of gender in the clinical presentation, symptoms, or disease severity of HF-PEF or about the contribution of these differences to gender differences in morbidity and mortality in patients with HF-PEF. This study examined gender differences in clinical presentation, hospitalization, and mortality in patients with HF-PEF (ejection fraction > or = 50%) enrolled in the ancillary arm of the Digitalis Investigation Group trial. Time-to-event analysis was performed using Cox proportional-hazards modeling. The study cohort included 719 patients (378 men, 341 women). At baseline, compared with men, women were older and had greater clinical severity of HF, as evidenced by worse New York Heart Association functional class, more frequent symptoms and signs of HF, and more treatment with diuretics. Ischemia was identified as the primary cause of HF in 46% of women and 56% of men (p = 0.01). During a median follow-up of 39 months, crude mortality was similar in women and men (24.6% and 24.3%, p = 0.93), but more women were hospitalized for HF (26.7% vs 15.9%, p <0.001). After adjustment for baseline differences, female gender was an independent predictor of lower mortality (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.82), but HF hospitalization rates were similar between men and women (hazard ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.53). In conclusion, although the clinical manifestations of HF appear to be more severe in women with HF-PEF, after adjustment for baseline clinical differences, HF hospitalizations are not increased and survival expectancy is better for women compared with men."Heart	Epidemiology	"In unstable angina and/or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI), sex-related differences in outcomes are less well known than in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), where women experience worse outcomes than men. Our aim was a prospective comparison between men and women with UA/NSTEMI of baseline characteristics, in-hospital complications, mortality, reinfarctions and combined endpoint of mortality and/or reinfarction during hospital stay, at 30 days and at six months.Initial medical treatment was given to 92 men and 47 women with UA/NSTEMI. Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) were performed within the first 48 hours in cases of recurrent chest pain and/or rhythmic and/or hemodynamic instability.Women were significantly older (66.6 +/- 9.6 vs. 59.7 +/- 10.6, P = 0.0001), less physically active (76.6% vs. 91.3%, P = 0.035), with significantly more frequent arterial hypertension (78.7% vs. 51%, P = 0.0039) and insulin-treated diabetes (17% vs. 5.4%, P = 0.0341), but with less likely prior MI (21.3% vs. 48.9%, P = 0.003), smoking (10.6% vs. 32.6%, P = 0.009) and dyslipidemia with HDL-cholesterol < 1.0 mmol/L (25.5% vs. 46.4%, P = 0.015) than men. Though medical and invasive treatments were similar in both sexes, women were at significantly increased risk of in-hospital pulmonary edema (OR 4.16, 95% CI 1.51 to 11.45) but not at increased risk of adverse in-hospital, 30-day and six-month outcomes in comparison with men.Women with UA/NSTEMI, being significantly older and with more comorbidity, were at significantly increased risk of in-hospital heart failure but not at increased risk of in-hospital, 30-day and six-month adverse outcomes when compared with men, despite their similar treatments."Heart	Clinical	"Heart failure studies have suggested important differences between women and men both in heart failure etiology and in survival. Clinical trials and long-standing perceptions of the typical heart failure patient have related far more to men than to women, while more women than men in the United States may be hospitalized with heart failure. The goal of this study was to analyze ADHERE Registry data, the largest database of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patient hospitalizations available, to gain insight into the effect of gender on medical history, clinical characteristics, and discharge counseling. This preliminary study analyzed the 85,617 ADHF hospitalizations in the ADHERE Registry as of October 2003, with 44,340 (52%) women and 41,276 (48%) men included. Women were significantly older (mean age 74.6 +/- 13.7 years) than men (mean age 70.2 +/- 13.9 years, P < .0001). Women were more likely to have a history of hypertension (75% vs. 69%, P < .0001) and a systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg (56% vs. 44%, P < .0001). History of coronary artery disease was more common in men (64% vs. 51%, P < .0001). Other risk factors for atherosclerosis, including smoking (17% vs. 10%, P < .0001) and hyperlipidemia (37% vs. 32%, P < .0001), were also more common in men. Men had a significantly lower mean left ventricular ejection fraction (32.9%, N = 30,831) than women (42.1%, N = 29,744); 51% of women had preserved left ventricular function (EF > 40%) compared to only 28% of men (P < 0.0001). At discharge, adherence to 3 of the 4 JCAHO standardized measures of quality of care far heart failure patients were documented more frequently for men than for women. A significantly smaller proportion of women received discharge instructions on management of diet, weight, and medications (30.1% vs. 32.8%); received or were scheduled for assessment of left ventricular function (81.5% vs. 85.6%); or were discharged with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor prescription if appropriate (72.6% vs. 73.9%). Real-world data from the ADHERE Registry may lead to better recognition of the signs and symptoms of heart failure in women, increase the proportion of women who are correctly diagnosed, and may help to support gender-specific considerations in heart failure guidelines."Heart	Outcomes	"Epidemiologic studies suggest that women are at increased risk of developing heart failure secondary to hypertension. Other studies have documented sex differences in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in the presence of pressure overload states such as seen in aortic stenosis and hypertension. It is less clear if sex differences are present among older persons with mild hypertension.One hundred seven healthy subjects, aged 55 to 75 years, with blood pressures ranging from 130 to 159 mm Hg systolic and/or 85 to 99 mm Hg diastolic, were examined by standard echocardiography and the newer modalities of tissue Doppler and color M-mode imaging.Women had a lower peak mitral annular systolic velocity (Sm), 8.9 (95% CI 8.4-9.5) cm/s versus 10.2 (95% CI 9.6-11.0) cm/s, (P < .01) than men. Among women, increasing age was associated with a reduction in diastolic function. For every decade of age, peak early mitral annular diastolic velocity (Em) declined by 1.6 cm/s (P < .01), mitral inflow velocity of propagation (Vp) declined by 26% (P < .01), E/Vp ratio increased by 20% (P = .03), and E/Em ratio increased by 11% (P = .04) in women. No age-associated changes were seen in men.As revealed by newer echocardiographic imaging modalities, women with mild hypertension showed greater reductions in systolic and diastolic function as they aged compared with men. Our findings are consistent with the increased risk older women have of developing heart failure because of hypertension."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Gender disparities in ECG variables and susceptibility to arrhythmia exist. The basis of these sex-related distinctions in cardiac electrophysiology has been extensively studied in various species, but is virtually unexplored in humans. The aim of this study was to clarify the cellular basis of electrophysiological gender disparities in human cardiac myocytes. Human midmyocardial left ventricular myocytes were isolated from explanted hearts of male and female patients in end-stage heart failure at the time of cardiac transplantation. The action potentials, sarcolemmal ion currents, and susceptibility to the generation of early afterdepolarizations were studied using whole-cell patch-clamp methodology. The functional effects of gender disparities in sarcolemmal ion currents were assessed by computer simulations using the Priebe-Beuckelmann or the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov human ventricular cell models. Female myocytes had significantly longer action potentials and greater susceptibility to early afterdepolarizations than male myocytes. All other action potential parameters (resting membrane potential, amplitude, plateau level, upstroke velocity, maximal velocity of phase-1 and phase-3 repolarization) had similar values for both genders. In female myocytes, the transient outward potassium current (I(to1)) tended to be smaller, while the L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) and quasi-steady state current (I(QSS)) tended to be larger. Computer simulations showed that these subtle differences in sarcolemmal ion currents may conspire to cause the observed gender disparities in action potential properties. Female failing myocytes have longer action potentials and a greater susceptibility to early afterdepolarizations than male failing myocytes. These gender disparities may be due to slightly larger depolarizing I(Ca,L) in conjunction with slightly smaller repolarizing I(QSS) and I(to1) in female myocytes."Heart	Clinical	"Anemia is common in subjects with chronic heart failure, and correction of anemia improves quality of life and exercise capacity in both men and women. The definition of anemia is sex-specific, but enrollment criteria of studies examining the effects of recombinant human erythropoietin in chronic heart failure to date have not taken sex into account. Indeed, it is unknown whether sex-specific differences of hemoglobin values observed in normal individuals are maintained in subjects with chronic disease and volume overload states. Given the significant treatment implications for sex-specific differences in hemoglobin values, the authors analyzed data for 260 subjects consecutively admitted with decompensated chronic heart failure. In a multivariate regression analysis controlling for serum creatinine and age, female sex was independently associated with lower hemoglobin. When deciding upon initiation of treatment in this population, sex-specific targets should be applied."Heart	Review	"Approximately half of the nearly 5 million people in the United States who have heart failure (HF) are women. The vast majority of women with advanced HF are elderly and many of them have HF with evidence of normal or preserved left ventricular systolic function. Although coronary disease is a common cause of HF for both men and women, a history of hypertension or diabetes places a woman at particular risk. Many fewer women than men have been enrolled in trials of therapies for patients with HF. Sex-specific results have been reported for some of these therapies, but not all trial data have been analyzed for sex-related differences. In spite of these differences in outcome, cardiac transplantation remains an important option for women with very advanced HF. Future research on therapies for HF will need to target women for enrollment, and all data analysis should include results that are stratified by sex."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Women with coronary heart disease (CHD) are more likely than men to develop congestive heart failure (CHF). Dysregulation of sympathetic and volume-regulatory hormones may contribute to the onset of symptomatic CHF. We hypothesized that this hormonal dysregulation develops at an earlier stage of CHD in women than in men.The study goals were (1) to determine the effect of gender on basal and exercise-induced plasma concentrations of catecholamines and volume-regulatory hormones in patients diagnosed with CHD, New York Heart Association class I and (2) to determine efficacy of the 6-minute walk test as a stimulus for release of these hormones.Study participants were 9 women and 9 men with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (>50%) and CHD confirmed by arteriography. Data were collected under resting conditions, and after the 6-minute walk test, in the general clinical research center of a northeastern university medical center.Basal plasma vasopressin (VP) concentration was significantly higher in men than in women (P = .018). Exercise, for women and men combined, significantly increased atrial natriuretic peptide (P < .0005), VP (P = .04), norepinephrine (P < .0005), and epinephrine (P = .038) but not plasma renin activity (P = .09). No further gender differences were detected for basal levels, or for the magnitude of exercise-induced increases, for any of the hormones measured.The 6-minute walk test is an exercise of sufficient intensity and duration to initiate the release of hormones associated with sympathetic activation and fluid-electrolyte regulation in both women and men with CHD. It appears that a gender difference was detected only for basal VP levels."Heart	Clinical	"Diastolic heart failure is common in the elderly, particularly women. Previous studies on the value of brain natriuretic peptide in diastolic dysfunction have been largely limited to male subjects. The authors found that female gender, in addition to diastolic function, is an independent predictor of brain natriuretic peptide levels in the elderly without systolic ventricular dysfunction. The authors' data indicate that an optimal threshold of brain natriuretic peptide for detecting diastolic dysfunction should be gender-specific."Heart	Clinical	"Dyspnoea is a common symptom of chronic heart failure (CHF). In the community setting, patients with CHF are most often women.To examine the impact of gender on the description of dyspnoea and to explore which clinical variables support a diagnosis of CHF.From four primary health care centres, 158 patients with CHF were included. Patients were examined with echocardiography and a cardiologist assessed the diagnosis of CHF. The patients filled in a questionnaire containing 11 descriptors of dyspnoea.A diagnosis of CHF was confirmed in 87 (55%) patients (47 males and 40 females). One descriptor, I feel that I am suffocating, was significantly scored higher in CHF patients (p=0.014) as compared to non-CHF patients. Three descriptors, My breath does not go in all the way (p=0.006), I feel that I am suffocating (p=0.040), and I cannot get enough air (p=0.0327) were significantly scored higher among men with CHF, compared to no descriptor among women with CHF. Being male (OR=2.7; CI: 1.3-5.6, p=0.008), having diabetes (OR=5.6; CI: 1.7-18.2, p=0.004), IHD (OR=3.3; CI: 1.3-8.5, p=0.014), and a borderline significance for age (OR=1.04; CI: 0.99-1.08, p=0.058) predicted a confirmed diagnosis of CHF.Three descriptors of dyspnoea were associated with CHF among men, whereas no such association was found among women. Our results suggest that gender is an important factor and should-together with age, underlying heart disease, and diabetes-be taken into account when symptoms are evaluated in the diagnosis of CHF in primary care."Heart	Management	"Previous studies have demonstrated that women hospitalized for heart failure receive poorer quality of care and have worse outcomes than men. However, these studies were based upon selected patient populations and lacked quality of care measures.We used data from the National Heart Failure Project, a national sample of fee-for-service Medicare patients hospitalized with heart failure in the United States in 1998-1999, to evaluate differences in quality of care and patient outcomes between men and women. Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression models and chi2 analyses were used to examine sex differences in the documentation of left ventricular systolic function (LVSF), prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for patients with left ventricular dysfunction, and mortality within 30 days and 1 year of admission in the study cohort (n = 30,996).Women had lower overall rates of LVSF assessment than men (64.9% vs 69.5%, P < .001). Among patients classified as candidates for ACE inhibitor prescription, women had lower crude rates of ACE inhibitor prescription than men (70.1% vs 74.2%, P = .015), but treatment rates were similar when evaluating the prescription of ACE inhibitors or ARBs (78.9% women vs 81.3% men, P = .11). Despite lower rates of treatment, women had lower mortality rates than men at 30 days (9.2% vs 11.4%, P < .001) and 1 year (36.2% vs 43.0%, P < .001) after admission. Results were similar after multivariable adjustment.There were small sex differences in the quality of care provided to fee-for-service Medicare patients hospitalized with heart failure, although women had higher rates of survival than men up to 1 year after hospitalization."Heart	Pathophysiology	"The goal of this study was to determine the role of estrogen receptor subtypes in the development of pressure overload hypertrophy in mice. Epidemiological studies have suggested gender differences in the development of hypertrophy and heart disease, but the mechanism and the role of estrogen receptor subtypes are not established. We performed transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and sham operations in male and female wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking functional estrogen receptor-alpha [alpha-estrogen receptor knockout (alpha-ERKO)] and mice lacking estrogen receptor-beta (beta-ERKO). Body, heart, and lung weights were measured 2 wk postsurgery. WT male mice subjected to TAC showed a 64% increase in the heart weight-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW) compared with sham, and WT males have increased lung weight at 2 wk. WT female mice subjected to TAC showed a 31% increase in HW/BW compared with sham, which was significantly less than their male counterparts and with no evidence of heart failure. alpha-ERKO females developed HW/BW nearly identical to that seen in WT littermate females in response to TAC, indicating that estrogen receptor-alpha is not essential for the attenuation of hypertrophy observed in WT females. In contrast, beta-ERKO females responded to TAC with a significantly greater increase in HW/BW than WT littermate females. beta-ERKO females have lower expression of lipoprotein lipase at baseline than WT or alpha-ERKO females. These data suggest an important role for estrogen receptor-beta in attenuating the hypertrophic response to pressure overload in females."Heart	Clinical	"There are few community-based epidemiologic studies that have dealt with risk factors for heart failure in non-Western populations. It has been reported that the measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is useful for detecting patients with asymptomatic heart failure. To clarify the determinants of high plasma BNP level, the association of BNP with cardiovascular risk factors in community dwelling residents was examined. The plasma BNP levels were measured in 686 residents aged 35-69 years who received annual health check-up. The relationship of BNP to blood pressure, blood haemoglobin, serum cholesterol (total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), plasma glucose, electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, urinary salt excretion, and lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol consumption) were cross-sectionally analysed. The plasma BNP geometric mean was 13.7 pg/ml. Both linear and logistic regression analyses indicated that the plasma BNP levels were positively associated with age, urinary salt excretion, higher blood pressure, high R-wave voltage in the 12-lead ECG (Minnesota Code 3-1 or 3-3), and female gender. Plasma BNP levels were inversely associated with blood haemoglobin levels. Gender-specific analysis showed similar results. However, plasma BNP did not correlate with other cardiovascular risk factors such as serum lipids."Heart	Outcomes	"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has a beneficial effect on clinical symptoms, exercise capacity, and systolic left ventricular (LV) performance in patients with heart failure. The aim of the current study was to evaluate whether a gender difference exists in response to CRT.Consecutive patients with end-stage heart failure (New York Heart Association, NYHA, class III-IV), LV ejection fraction (LVEF) < or =35%, QRS duration >120 ms, and left bundle branch block configuration underwent CRT. At baseline and 6 months post-CRT, clinical and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated; follow-up was obtained up to 5 years. The effects of CRT were compared between women and men.The study population comprised 137 men and 36 women (mean age 66 +/- 11 years). No differences in baseline characteristics were observed except that nonischemic cardiomyopathy was more frequent in women than men (67% vs 38%, P < 0.05). In all patients, clinical and echocardiographic parameters improved significantly at 6-month follow-up. The magnitude of improvement in different parameters was similar between women and men, e.g., the improvement in NYHA Class was 0.9 +/- 0.6 in women and 1.0 +/- 0.7 in men (NS) and the increase in LVEF was 8 +/- 8% in women as compared to 7 +/- 9% in men (NS). The percentage of individual responders was not different between women and men (76% vs 80%, NS) and 2-year survival was comparable for women and men (84% vs 80%, NS).No gender differences were observed in response to CRT and long-term survival after CRT."Heart	Outcomes	"Heart failure (HF) patients have a high degree of fragility and dependence from physical, cognitive and psychological points of view, and are a mainly geriatric population.To detect the existence of fragility in all patients treated in a Heart Failure Unit and to evaluate age and sex differences.All patients underwent a basic geriatric evaluation to detect possible loss of autonomy for doing basic and instrumental activities, cognitive deterioration, emotional disturbance or social risk.Three hundred sixty patients (mean age 65.2 years, 41.7% > or = 70 years, 27.5% women) were evaluated. Fragility was detected in 41.7% of patients, being more prevalent in patients > or = 70 years (p<0.001) and in women (p<0.001). A Barthel Index < 90 was found in 22.5% of patients and an anomalous OARS Scale was found in 18.3%. Pfeiffer test's score was abnormal in 7.8% of patients. A positive depression response in abbreviate GDS was observed in 29.7%. All items analysed were more prevalent in patients > or = 70 years and in women, with the unexpected exception of depression symptoms that were as prevalent in younger as in older patients.Fragility is common in patients with heart failure, even in younger patients, and can be detected easily using standardised geriatric scales. Prevalence of fragility was significantly higher in older patients and in women, although the presence of depression symptoms was as prevalent in younger as in older patients."Heart	Review	"Large differences exist between women and men in the syndrome of heart failure (HF). In contrast to men, hypertension and diabetes represent the major risk factors for development of HF in women and hypertension is also the major cause of left ventricular hypertrophy and stroke. Left ventricular hypertrophy in women increases the risk for mortality to a higher degree than it does in men. The clinical course of HF is generally more benign and more frequently characterized by HF with preserved systolic function. Estrogen receptors are present in the human heart. Based on data from rodent models, they are believed to modulate hypertrophy and the progression of HF. Some of the signaling pathways have been described and involve phosphorylation of intracellular kinases and production of nitric oxide. Interestingly, estrogen receptors are upregulated in human hypertrophy and HF. The clinical course of HF in women is characterized by the more frequent occurrence of diastolic HF. Myocardial remodeling with age and, as a consequence, of mechanical load is different in both genders. Adherence to guidelines in the diagnosis and treatment of HF is less strict in women than in men, leading to undertreatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Women are generally underrepresented in clinical trials in HF and gender-specific analyses have been neglected in most older large survival trials. In some of the large survival studies angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-receptor blockers did not reach significant endpoints in women. However, meta-analyses show overall positive effects for these groups of substances. Angiotensin receptor blockers were effective in large studies including high percentages of women."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Human studies reveal sex differences in myocardial function as well as in the incidence and manifestation of heart disease. Myocellular Ca(2+) cycling regulates normal contractile function; whereas cardiac dysfunction in heart failure has been associated with alterations in Ca(2+)-handling proteins. Beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) signaling regulates activity of several Ca(2+)-handling proteins and alterations in beta-AR signaling are associated with heart disease. This study examines sex differences in expression of beta(1)-AR, beta(2)-AR, and Ca(2+)-handling proteins including: L-type calcium channel (Ca(v)1.2) , ryanodine calcium-release channels (RyR), sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA2), phospholamban (PLB) and Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange protein (NCX) in healthy hearts from male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Protein levels were examined using Western blot analysis. Abundance of mRNA was determined by real time RT-PCR normalized to abundance of GAPDH mRNA. Contraction parameters were measured in right ventricular papillary muscle in the presence and absence of isoproterenol. Results demonstrate that female ventricle has significantly higher levels of Ca(v)1.2, RyR, and NCX protein compared to males. Messenger RNA abundance for RyR, and NCX protein was significantly higher in females whereas Ca(v)1.2 mRNA was higher in males. No differences were detected in beta-ARs, SERCA2 or PLB. Female right papillary muscle had a faster maximal rate of force development and decline (+/- dF/dt). There were no sex differences in response to isoproterenol. Results show significant sex differences in expression of key ventricular Ca(2+)-handling proteins that are associated with small functional differences in +/- dF/dt. Further studies will determine whether differences in the abundance of these key proteins play a role in sex disparities in the incidence and manifestation of heart disease."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Mutations in sarcomeric proteins can lead to either hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy depending on their effects on the structural and functional properties of the contractile unit of the heart. Mutations in cardiac troponin T, which binds the calcium-responsive troponin complex to alpha-tropomyosin, have been shown to result in cardiac hypertrophy or cardiac dilatation and heart failure, depending on the nature of the specific mutation. In this study, we report the identification of a novel cardiac troponin T mutation (A171S) leading to dilated cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death. In contrast to prior described mutations, the A171S mutation results in a significant gender difference in the severity of the observed phenotype with adult males (over 20 years of age) demonstrating more severe ventricular dilatation [left ventricular end diastolic dimension (LVEDD) 7.1 vs. 5.1cm; P=0.01, t test] and left ventricular dysfunction [left ventricular shortening fraction (LVSF) 21 vs. 34%; P=0.04, t test] than adult females. The described mutation substitutes a hydrophilic amino acid for a hydrophobic one in a highly conserved domain involved in the interaction between troponin T and alpha-tropomyosin. Interestingly, four previously described mutations within 12 amino acids of A171 lead to a hypertrophic phenotype, suggesting that further characterization of the functional consequences of the A171S mutation may lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and of the functional differences between HCM- and DCM-causing mutations in cardiac troponin T."Heart	Review	"Gender differences in the syndrome of heart failure (HF) occur in etiology and pathophysiology and lead to differences in the clinical presentation and course of the syndrome. In addition, gender specific treatment responses and gender associated differences in the behavior of treating physicians are found. Hypertension and diabetes play a major role as causes of HF in women and both interact in their pathophysiology with the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Modulation of the RAS by estrogens explains specific differences between pre- and post-menopausal women and men. Myocardial growth processes and myocardial calcium handling are differentially regulated in female and male myocytes. Myocardial remodeling with age and as a consequence of mechanical load differs in women and men. For yet unknown reasons, HF with preserved systolic function seems to be more frequent in women than in men and the clinical course of systolic HF is different in both genders. Medical therapy in heart failure has usually not been specified according to gender and gender specific analysis has been neglected in most large survival trials. Only a post-hoc analysis of gender differences led to the recognition of increased mortality with digitalis therapy in women. Single studies on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or beta-receptor blockers did not reach significant end points in women whereas meta-analyses showed overall positive effects. Side effects of ACEI are more common and pharmacokinetics of beta-blockers are different in women. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are equally well tolerated in women and men. RAS inhibition may be particularly advantageous in postmenopausal women in whom the natural modulation of the RAS by estrogens is lost."Heart	Outcomes	"Little is known about sex-related differences in factors affecting prognosis of heart failure (HF). We prospectively investigated the relationship between bedside clinical variables and survival of older females vs. males with HF.Included were consecutive unselected inpatients, age >/=60 years, admitted for various acute conditions. HF was chronic and of diverse etiologies. Follow-up extended up to 5 years. All-cause mortality was registered and statistically analyzed for association with in-hospital clinical variables.Included were 162 females and 200 males. Survival rates were 52.4% and 59%, respectively, (P=0.1). Advanced age and renal dysfunction (RD) were associated with low survival in both sexes (P<0.03 and 0.02, P<0.001 and 0.01, respectively). An association with low survival was found with respect to; admission for pulmonary edema (P<0.02), using furosemide >/=80 mg/day (P<0.005) and severe HF [NYHA class III-IV (P<0.01)] in females, as well as for hypokalemia (P<0.03) and hypocalcemia (P<0.03) in males. On multivariate analysis RD (P<0.001), increasing age (P=0.008) and furosemide dosage >/=80 mg (P=0.02) were most significantly associated with low survival in females, while RD only was significantly associated with low survival in males (P=0.03).Several clinical variables, which affect prognosis in older HF patients are sex-related and probably carry practical significance."Heart	Management	"Heart Failure (HF) is now an epidemiologic nightmare, with a higher prevalence in older women. Overall, within the population, more women have HF even with age-adjusted rates for both sexes. There is evidence that men and women with HF differ with respect to epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Yet, current diagnosis and treatment do not address the gender differences, resulting in the clinical instability of women after discharge and the high rate of unnecessary hospital readmissions within 90 days. Clinical nurse specialist case managers (CNSCMs) are integral in closing the gap for quality outcomes for this population. With patient advocacy, comprehensive monitoring and postdischarge follow-up, and utilization of current research to establish evidence-based practice, outcomes can be markedly improved."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Aldosterone is associated with myocardial fibrosis in experimental studies and with left ventricular remodeling in heart failure patients. We hypothesized that aldosterone influences ventricular remodeling in people without congestive heart failure in the community. We examined the relations between serum aldosterone and echocardiographic left ventricular measurements in 2820 Framingham Study subjects (mean age 57 years, 58% women, 88% white) free of myocardial infarction and overt heart failure. Serum aldosterone levels were higher in women compared with men. In linear regression models (adjusted for age, systolic blood pressure, weight, height, diabetes, heart rate, hypertension treatment, and ethnicity), left ventricular wall thickness and relative wall thickness were positively related, and left ventricular diastolic dimensions were inversely related to serum aldosterone in women (P<0.05 for all), but not in men (P>0.20 for all). There was no effect modification of the relations observed in women by menopausal status. The gender-related differences in relations of serum aldosterone to relative wall thickness were consistent across subgroups defined on the basis of sex-specific median values of systolic blood pressure and body mass index. Fractional shortening, left ventricular mass, and left atrial dimensions were not related to serum aldosterone in either sex. In conclusion, in our community-based sample of individuals free of myocardial infarction and heart failure, serum aldosterone was positively associated with a left ventricular geometric pattern suggestive of concentric remodeling (increased left ventricular wall thickness and relative wall thickness but decreased internal dimensions) in women but not in men. Additional investigations are warranted to confirm these findings."Heart	Epidemiology	"The epidemic of heart failure has yet to be fully investigated, and data on incidence, survival, and sex-specific temporal trends in community-based populations are limited.To test the hypothesis that the incidence of heart failure has declined and survival after heart failure diagnosis has improved over time but that secular trends have diverged by sex.Population-based cohort study using the resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Patients were 4537 Olmsted County residents (57% women; mean [SD] age, 74 [14] years) with a diagnosis of heart failure between 1979 and 2000. Framingham criteria and clinical criteria were used to validate the diagnosisIncidence of heart failure and survival after heart failure diagnosis.The incidence of heart failure was higher among men (378/100 000 persons; 95% confidence interval [CI], 361-395 for men; 289/100 000 persons; 95% CI, 277-300 for women) and did not change over time among men or women. After a mean follow-up of 4.2 years (range, 0-23.8 years), 3347 deaths occurred, including 1930 among women and 1417 among men. Survival after heart failure diagnosis was worse among men than women (relative risk, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.24-1.43) but overall improved over time (5-year age-adjusted survival, 43% in 1979-1984 vs 52% in 1996-2000, P<.001). However, men and younger persons experienced larger survival gains, contrasting with less or no improvement for women and elderly persons.In this community-based cohort, the incidence of heart failure has not declined during 2 decades, but survival after onset of heart failure has increased overall, with less improvement among women and elderly persons."Heart	Review	"Heart failure appears to be less common and less severe in females, and elderly women have a better overall survival after myocardial infarction than males and also a decreased risk of arrhythmic death. Human and animal studies also show that females display more favorable cardiac remodeling in several experimental and clinical conditions. However, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms have not been established, even though estrogens, beta-adrenergic stimulation, the renin-angiotensin system, and a greater resistance to myocardiocyte apoptosis in females have been proposed as hypothetical contributing factors. Indeed, epidemiologic, experimental and clinical evidence of gender differences in myocardial remodeling and heart failure favoring women could prompt the use of female myocardial progenitor or stem cells for cellular replacement therapy in cardiac failure, on the premises of a greater protection from myocardial apoptosis and unfavorable remodeling in women."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Sexual dimorphism is observed in the progression to congestive heart failure and, ultimately, in longevity in spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rats. As platelet activation may impact development of cardiovascular diseases, we studied the effects of obesity and sex on platelet polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) profile and its relationship to platelet aggregation in 6-month-old SHHF rats. After a 24-hr fast, blood was obtained for measurement of platelet phospholipid omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) PUFA. Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was measured by whole-blood impedance aggregometry. Obese male (OM) SHHF had significantly more platelet arachidonic acid (AA) and total n-6 PUFA than lean males (LMs), lean females (LFs), or obese females (OFs). Platelet aggregation was enhanced in males compared to females, with OMs by 45% compared to OFs and with LMs by 28% compared to LFs. Though no difference was found between OFs and LFs, platelet aggregation was increased in OMs by 20% compared to LMs. Though not significantly different, lag time to initiate platelet aggregation tended to be shortest in OMs and then, in increasing duration, LMs, LFs, and OFs, suggesting that platelets from male rats were quicker to aggregate than those from females. Platelet aggregation was correlated with platelet AA and total n-6 PUFA content. There was no relationship between n-3 PUFA and platelet aggregation. In SHHF rats, elevated AA and n-6 PUFA levels in platelets are associated with enhanced platelet aggregation. This relationship is potentiated by obesity and male sex."Heart	Epidemiology	"Although some studies have shown that hospital admissions for heart failure doubled between 1973 and 1995, other data suggest that the heart failure hospitalization epidemic has stabilized in the United States. We sought to describe trends in heart failure hospitalizations over the past decade using data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS).The NHDS provides annual estimates of hospitalization discharges from a sample of hospitals in the United States. We combined the heart failure hospitalization frequencies with census estimates to calculate age and gender-specific annual hospitalization rates.Hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of heart failure among adults (age > or =35) increased from 810,624 in 1990 to 989,500 in 1995 (annual increase 36,088, R2 = 0.816, P =.014), and to 1,088,349 in 1999 (annual increase 31,091, R2 = 0.780, P =.047). The age-adjusted hospitalization rate (per 1000 persons) increased from 7.186 in 1990 to 8.554 in 1999 for women (annual increase 0.14/year, R2 = 0.731, P =.002) and from 6.892 in 1990 to 7.372 in 1999 for men (annual increase 0.011/year, R2 = 0.008, P = 0.80). For women, the annual hospitalization rate increased from 1990 to 1999 in each age group (35-64, 65-74, 75-84, and > or =85), while the age-specific rates did not change in men.Heart failure hospitalizations have continued to increase from 1990 to 1999. Although aging and growth of the US population contribute to this trend, the increases are substantially influenced by changes in hospitalization rates in women."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Myocardial hypertrophy and extended cardiac fibrosis are independent risk factors for congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Before age 50, men are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease than age-matched women. In the current studies, we found that cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were significantly more pronounced in males compared with females of guanylyl cyclase-A knockout (GC-A KO) mice at 16 wk of age. These gender-related differences were not seen in wild-type mice. In the further studies, either castration (at 10 wk of age) or flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, markedly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in male GC-A KO mice without blood pressure change. In contrast, ovariectomy (at 10 wk of age) had little effect. Also, chronic testosterone infusion increased cardiac mass and fibrosis in ovariectomized GC-A mice. None of the treatments affected cardiac mass or the extent of fibrosis in wild-type mice. Overexpression of mRNAs encoding atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, collagens I and III, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta3, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin converting enzyme in the ventricles of male GC-A KO mice was substantially decreased by castration. The gender differences were virtually abolished by targeted deletion of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor gene (AT1A). Neither castration nor testosterone administration induced any change in the cardiac phenotypes of double-KO mice for GC-A and AT1A. Thus, we suggest that androgens contribute to gender-related differences in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis by a mechanism involving AT1A receptors and GC-A."Heart	Review	"Under-representation of women in heart failure trials has limited our knowledge of heart failure in women to extrapolation of findings from men. Significant sex related differences in clinical and laboratory characteristics exist in systolic heart failure including better survival in women. The value of various therapeutic interventions should be based on proven effect in women and not on an assumption based on proven benefit in men. Among the medications currently recommended for patients with systolic heart failure, beta-blockers have the strongest data supporting their efficacy in women."Heart	Outcomes	"Congestive heart failure (CHF) is increasing in incidence and prevalence in both men and women in Canada. Research findings to date have been inconsistent with respect to whether gender differences influence quality of life, treatment and survival. There is a paucity of qualitative research describing the experience of patients with CHF This qualitative case study approach used semistructured interviews with women and men with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class three or four CHF who were referred to a CHF clinic. In addition to quality of life measures, data related to medical history, medical management and NYHA scores were collected to offer a thorough description of these clients' experiences. Three hypotheses were generated from 13 themes that emerged. First, the psychosocial impact of CHF outweighs the physical impact. Second, sex differences exist in relation to living with CHF with men being more accepting of CHF and more likely to experience social isolation and loss than women, while women are more likely to describe fear. Third, the experience of CHF is influenced by age with physical experiences and depression mentioned more frequently in younger age groups. Findings from this study have generated nursing implications and recommendations for further research."Heart	Outcomes	"The objective of this study was to explore whether gender differences exist in health-related quality of life for older adult men and women with heart failure.A secondary data analysis was conducted on an existing dataset of heart failure patients. The original study used an exploratory, correlational longitudinal design.138 subjects (69 men and 69 women) with heart failure completed both data points of the study.Men and women were similar on the number and types of heart failure-related symptoms they experienced. Twenty-seven percent of the subjects could be classified as depressed. The men had better physical functioning than the women did with gender making a greater contribution to physical functioning than age or marital status. Twenty-three percent of the subjects were rehospitalized 4 to 6 weeks after the initial hospital discharge.This study showed that the health related quality of life for older men and women with heart failure is significantly impacted by heart failure. Older men and women have similar heart failure symptoms, depression, and rehospitalization following a hospital admission for heart failure. Both older men and older women with heart failure have impairments in their physical functioning with older women more physically impaired than older men."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Sex differences in cardiomyopathic phenotype and the role of gonadal status were studied in mice with cardiac overexpression of beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (ARs) over 6-15 months (mo) of age. Survival to 15 mo was 96% in wild-type mice but was poorer in transgenic (TG) mice and lower for males than females (13% vs. 56%, P < 0.001). Echocardiography demonstrated progressive left ventricular (LV) dilatation and reduction in LV fractional shortening in male but much less marked changes in female TG mice. Incidences of atrial thrombosis, pleural effusion and lung congestion were higher and myocyte size and fibrosis in the LV were greater in TG males than females. Deprivation of testicular hormones by castration during 3-15 mo of age improved survival and significantly ameliorated LV dysfunction, remodeling, and hypertrophy compared with intact TG males. No significant effect, except for a trend of a better survival, was detected by ovariectomy in TG females. In conclusion, cardiac beta(2)-AR overexpression at a high level leads to cardiomyopathy and heart failure with aging. Female mice had less cardiac remodeling, dysfunction, and pathology and a marked survival advantage over male mice, and this was independent of prevailing levels of ovarian hormones. TG males showed benefit from orchiectomy, suggesting a contribution by testicular hormones to the progression of the cardiomyopathic phenotype."Heart	Outcomes	"Despite today's modern therapy, the advancement of chronic heart failure (CHF) has not been curbed (Dying from heart failure: lessons from palliative care, BMJ, 317, 1998, 961-962, Editorial). Consequently, the suffering in patients with end-stage CHF is still present. The knowledge on the frequency of symptoms in these patients is scarce.The aim of this study was to achieve a deeper understanding of patients with end-stage CHF and to describe symptoms in these patients during the last 6 months of life by examining documentation in medical records.The study adopted a descriptive, retrospective design using record reviews to collect data, in which 80 medical records of patients hospitalised for CHF in 1995 were reviewed. Descriptive statistics and Student's t-tests were performed.Breathlessness was the most common symptom (men 90%, women 86%). The largest gender difference was on limitation in physical activity (men=77%, women=37%, total=49%, P=0.001).(1) Twenty-one symptoms were observed, implicating that, patients with CHF in later stages of the disease experience a wide range of symptoms. (2) Despite the fact that several symptoms were documented by both nurses and physicians, it is quite remarkable that symptom-controlling measures were only provided sparingly. (3) A palliative care approach may benefit patients suffering from end-stage CHF."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Gender differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease have been observed both clinically and experimentally. These cardioprotective effects have frequently been attributed to female hormones, however, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this cardioprotection are still poorly understood. Accordingly, this study sought to determine the contribution of ovarian hormones to the prevention of adverse ventricular remodeling and congestive heart failure in chronic volume overload (i.e. aortocaval fistula in intact or ovariectomized female rats). Ovariectomized rats developed more extensive cardiac remodeling than intact females at 21 weeks post-fistula, characterized by significantly greater left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (167 vs. 86%, respectively, p < 0.05) and a substantial increase in LV dilatation (71%, p < 0.05) relative to control. In contrast to the eccentric hypertrophy in ovariectomized females post-fistula, the hypertrophic response in the intact female hearts was essentially concentric. While neither fistula group suffered significant mortality, there was a marked increase in the lung weight of ovariectomized rats (87%, p < 0.05) consistent with the development of pulmonary edema. Overall, the extent of myocardial remodeling and decrease in LV function in the ovariectomized females was comparable to those changes reported for males with symptomatic heart failure, while intact females maintained chronic compensated ventricular function similar to that of controls. The marked ventricular dilatation and symptoms of congestive heart failure seen at 21 weeks post-fistula in the ovariectomized females clearly demonstrate the influence of circulating ovarian hormones on the pattern of myocardial remodeling resulting from a chronic volume overload."Heart	Review	"The incidence of congestive heart failure in the US population is increasing as more women and men survive with chronic hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease. Almost half the patients in the US with heart failure are women. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking are all more potent risk factors for the development of heart failure in women than in men. Important differences in presentation and mortality explain gender differences in the clinical course of heart failure. Overall mortality is lower for women than for men with symptomatic heart failure. Some but not all of this difference can be explained by a lower rate of ischemic heart disease. Standard treatments for congestive heart failure, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, have been shown to be equally efficacious in men and in women. Preliminary data on angiotensin II receptor blockers suggests equivalent benefit with further trial data awaited. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a form of heart failure unique to women, occurring in the last stages of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery. Approximately half of affected women regain normal ventricular function but for those who do not, the risk of recurrent symptomatic heart failure and mortality during subsequent pregnancies is high."Heart	Outcomes	"To evaluate possible gender differences in clinical profile and outcome of patients hospitalised with heart failure.During 1996 a total of 1065 hospital in-patients had confirmed heart failure, with follow-up data through 2002. Women (58%) were significantly older, had higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, and lower prevalence of ischaemic heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease and alcoholism. The proportion of patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased with age, but in all age groups women had normal LVEF more frequently than men. Echocardiography was performed less frequently in females: 62% vs. 71% in men, P<0.01, and this finding was consistent in all age groups. During follow-up (median 19 months) 507 patients died (216 men [48.8%] and 291 women [46.8%]). Gender was not a predictor of survival when LVEF was included in the model (RH Male Gender 0.8, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.1, P=0.2). There was a significant interaction gender-LVEF (P=0.048): survival was similar in both genders with LVEF >0.3 but women with LVEF </=0.3 had a better prognosis than their male counterparts.Survival is similar in women irrespective of LVEF and in men with LVEF >0.3 while men with severely depressed LVEF have a worse prognosis."Heart	Review	"Heart failure is a clinical syndrome of increasing prevalence in the United States, with significant morbidity and mortality. Although men have a higher annual mortality rate, more women than men die from heart failure each year. Optimal disease management is critical in limiting the impact of heart failure on life quality, quantity, and health care expenditures. Women have a unique risk-factor profile and different clinical manifestations of heart failure than men. Understanding inherent sex differences in heart failure epidemiology, pathophysiology, and natural history is imperative in determining whether the optimal therapy for this prevalent and important syndrome is affected by sex."Heart	Clinical	"In order to study the influence of gender on circulating levels of cardiac natriuretic hormones (CNHs) in heart failure, we measured the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) by means of highly sensitive and specific IRMA methods in 239 consecutive patients (age 64.7 +/- 11.6 years, range 21-89 years; 170 men and 69 women) with cardiomyopathy. There was different response of CNH according to gender in patients with heart failure, as indicated by the ratio between the individual CNH values of patients and the gender-specific cut-off values. Indeed, the mean ratio for ANP found in men (3.6 +/- 3.6) was significantly higher (p = 0.0075) than that found in women (2.4 +/- 2.1). The mean ratio for BNP was on average 2.3 fold higher (15.9 +/- 27.1 in men and 6.9 +/- 6.8 in women, p = 0.0084). Moreover, age, ejection fraction, and disease severity independently and significantly contributed to regression with both ANP (R = 0.612, F = 39.969, p < 0.0001) and BNP (R = 0.656, F = 49.957, p < 0.0001) values, while gender did not. In conclusion, our study suggests a different, gender-specific activation of the CNH system in this clinical condition, although age, ejection fraction and disease severity seem to be more powerful predictors than gender of circulating levels of ANP and BNP in patients with heart failure."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Heart failure (HF) is the end result of progressive and diverse biological adaptations within the diseased myocardium. We used cDNA microarrays and quantitative PCR to examine the transcriptomes of 38 left ventricles from failing and nonfailing human myocardium. After identification of a pool of putative HF-responsive candidate genes by microarrays on seven nonfailing and eight failing hearts, we used quantitative PCR and a general linear statistical model in a larger sample set (n = 34) to validate and examine the role of contributing biological variables (age and sex). We find that most HF-candidate genes (transcription factors, Cebpb, Npat; signaling molecules, Map2k3, Map4k5; extracellular matrix proteins, Lum, Cola1; and metabolic enzymes, Mars) demonstrated significant changes in gene expression; however, the majority of differences among samples depended on variables such as sex and age, and not on HF alone. Some HF-responsive gene products also demonstrated highly significant changes in expression as a function of age and/or sex, but independent of HF (Ngp1, Cd163, and Npat). These results emphasize the need to account for biological variables (HF, sex and age interactions) to elucidate genomic correlates that trigger molecular pathways responsible for the progression of HF syndromes."Heart	Review	"Foxglove and its constituents therapeutic agent digitalis have been used for centuries for the treatment of heart failure. All digitalis-like cardiotonic steroids enhance heart contraction through a mechanism involving the inhibition of the Na(+),K(+)- ATPase. Recently, Rathore and colleagues reported that sex-based differences may exist in the efficacy of digoxin for the treatment of heart failure. The authors of the study found that female patients exhibited increased risk of death associated with digoxin therapy, whereas male patients appeared to have no increased risk of death related to digoxin therapy. Blaustein and colleagues delve into the report and discuss possible explanations for these findings, suggest alternative ones, and advocate for enrolling greater numbers of women in clinical studies."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Transgenic (TG) TNF1.6 mice, which cardiac specifically overexpress tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), exhibit heart failure (HF) and increased mortality, which is markedly higher in young (<20 wk) males (TG-M) than females (TG-F). HF in this model may be partly caused by remodeling of the extracellular matrix and/or structure/function alterations at the single myocyte level. We studied left ventricular (LV) structure and function using echocardiography and LV myocyte morphometry, contractile function, and intracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(i)(2+)) handling using cell edge detection and fura 2 fluorescence, respectively, in 12-wk-old TG-M and TG-F mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates. TG-F mice showed LV hypertrophy without dilatation and only a small reduction of basal fractional shortening (FS) and response to isoproterenol (Iso). TG-M mice showed a large LV dilatation, higher mRNA levels of beta-myosin heavy chain and atrial natriuretic factor versus TG-F mice, reduced FS relative to both WT and TG-F mice, and minimal response to Iso. TG-F and TG-M myocytes were similarly elongated (by approximately 20%). The amplitude of Ca(i)(2+) transients and contractions and the response to Iso were comparable in WT and TG-F myocytes, whereas the time to 50% decline (TD(50%)) of the Ca(i)(2+) transient, an index of the rate of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) uptake, was prolonged in TG-F myocytes. In TG-M myocytes, the amplitudes of Ca(i)(2+) transients and contractions were reduced, TD(50%) of the Ca(i)(2+) transient was prolonged, and the inotropic effect of Iso on Ca(i)(2+) transients was reduced approximately twofold versus WT myocytes. Protein expression of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 2 and phospholamban was unaltered in TG versus WT hearts, suggesting functional origins of impaired Ca(2+) handling in the former. These results indicate that cardiac-specific overexpression of TNF-alpha induces myocyte hypertrophy and gender-dependent alterations in Ca(i)(2+) handling and contractile function, which may at least partly account for changes in LV geometry and in vivo cardiac function in this model."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Although insulin resistance has been implicated in the pathogenesis of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, previous studies have yielded inconsistent results and are limited by referral bias.We examined the relations between echocardiographic LV measurements and glucose tolerance status in 2623 Framingham Study subjects (1514 women, mean age 53 years) free of myocardial infarction and heart failure. We also evaluated the relations of insulin resistance (homeostasis model, HOMA-IR) and LV and left atrial (LA) measures within the normal and abnormal glucose tolerance categories (the latter included impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and newly diagnosed diabetes). LV mass (adjusted for age, height, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure) increased across categories of worsening glucose tolerance; the trend was more striking in women (P<0.001) compared with men (P=0.054). In subjects with normal (n=2022) and abnormal glucose tolerance (n=327), covariate-adjusted LV mass and LV wall thickness increased across HOMA-IR quartiles in women (P<0.001) but not men. In contrast, covariate-adjusted LA size increased with worsening glucose tolerance and across HOMA-IR quartiles in the normal and abnormal glucose tolerance groups in both sexes. Adjustment for body mass index considerably attenuated the relations of LV/LA measures and HOMA-IR, rendering them statistically nonsignificant in the normal glucose tolerance group.In our large community-based sample, LV mass and wall thickness increased with worsening glucose intolerance, an effect that was more striking in women compared with men. Insulin resistance was associated with increased LV mass in women alone, but this relation was largely accounted for by obesity."Heart	Pathophysiology	"We explored whether there are gender differences in cardiac remodeling and whether etiology influences organ and cellular remodeling in advanced heart failure (HF).Several studies have shown a survival benefit for women compared to men with symptomatic HF. This observation may be related to gender differences in cardiac remodeling.We studied hearts from 100 patients (72 men and 28 women) receiving cardiac transplantation at our institution. Cardiac morphology was assessed with echocardiography and direct measurement of cardiac mass. Cardiac myocyte volume, length, width, cross-sectional area, and contraction were measured using previously validated techniques.Among 50 patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), we observed no gender-based differences in cardiac or cellular remodeling. In contrast, among 50 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), the heart weight index was significantly greater in men, and there was a strong trend toward an increased left ventricular (LV) mass index as well. These gender differences in cardiac and LV mass were paralleled by marked gender differences in myocyte volume, such that average myocyte volume was 36% greater in men than in women, in association with a 14% increase in resting cell length.Our studies demonstrate a multilevel gender difference in post-infarction remodeling, with women exhibiting reduced hypertrophy. Our studies further demonstrate that gender differences in cardiac remodeling in ICM are largely related to fundamental differences in cellular remodeling rather than simply differences in infarct size or expansion. Distinctions observed between ischemic and idiopathic CM suggest that gender may influence local myocardial responses to injury."Heart	Review	"Significant differences between sexes may influence the prevalence, incidence and severity of the heart failure syndrome. These differences may also interfere with treatment and management. In this review sex differences and similarities have been analyzed focusing on epidemiology, drug therapy and psychological implications. Pathophysiological differences but also a selection bias are evident; such differences bear an influence on clinical management. Gender differences exist even in the health-related quality of life, depression and coping ability. No studies have been specifically designed to investigate gender differences and the exclusion of elderly persons (mainly women) from large trials may compromise the quality of their care."Heart	Outcomes	"Racial and gender differences in mortality rates have been reported for patients with systolic heart failure. Relatively little is known regarding diastolic heart failure prognosis.Our sample consisted of 1058 patients 65 years of age or older who were admitted to 30 hospitals in Northeastern Ohio with a principal diagnosis of heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of >/=50% by echocardiogram.Of the 1058 patients with diastolic heart failure (13% African American and 87% white), African Americans and whites were comparable with respect to history of angina, stroke, being on dialysis, and alcohol use; the proportion of male patients was also comparable. The African American to white adjusted odds ratio for 18-month mortality (all cause) was 1.03 (0.66-1.59). For men versus women (30% vs 70%), the above-mentioned comorbidities were comparable, except women were more likely to have a do not resuscitate status (16% vs 7.3%; p =.000) and to be older (79.5 +/- 8 vs 77 +/- 7; p =.000). Men were more likely to have a history of tobacco use (30% vs 14%; p =.000) and alcohol use (36% vs 15%; p =.000), and a higher serum creatinine level (1.7 +/- 1.2 vs 1.4 +/- 1.1; p =.001). The men to women adjusted odds ratio for 18-month mortality (all cause) was 1.06 (0.76-1.46).In this cohort of elderly patients admitted with diastolic heart failure, there were no ethnic or gender differences in 18-month mortality rates."Heart	Outcomes	"Prior investigators have suggested that quality of life differs in men and women with heart failure, especially in the physical functioning domain. The purpose of this study was to compare quality of life in men and women with heart failure to determine if differences exist after controlling for functional status, age, and ejection fraction.Data from a sample of 640 men and women (50% each) matched on New York Heart Association functional classification and age were used for this secondary analysis. Scores on the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire were compared at baseline and 3 months after enrollment using multivariate techniques with ejection fraction controlled. Treatment group (intervention versus control) was controlled statistically at 3 months because the original data were drawn from experimental and quasi-experimental studies in which an improvement in quality of life had been a goal of the intervention. The sexes differed on marital status, so this variable was controlled in analyses as well.In all analyses, quality of life was minimally worse in women compared with men (1-3 points at most). None of the differences reached statistical significance except for emotional quality of life at baseline (P =.03). By 3 months, both men and women reported significantly improved and comparable quality of life and there were no significant differences between them.Quality of life is similar in men and women with heart failure when functional status, age, ejection fraction, and marital status differences are controlled."Heart	Outcomes	"The goal of this study was to determine the influence of gender on baseline characteristics, response to treatment, and prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF) and impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).Under-representation of women in HF clinical trials has limited our understanding of gender-related differences in patients with HF.The impact of gender was assessed in the Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) which randomized 2,708 patients with New York Heart Association class III/IV and LVEF < or =0.35 to bucindolol versus placebo. Women (n = 593) were compared with men (n = 2,115). Mean follow-up period was two years.Significant differences in baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were found. Women were younger, more likely to be black, had a higher prevalence of nonischemic etiology, higher right and left ventricular ejection fraction, higher heart rate, greater cardiothoracic ratio, higher prevalence of left bundle branch block, lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation, and lower plasma norepinephrine level. Ischemic etiology and measures of severity of HF were found to be predictors of prognosis in women and men. However, differences in the predictive values of various variables were noted; most notably, coronary artery disease and LVEF appear to be stronger predictors of prognosis in women. In the nonischemic patients, women had a significantly better survival rate compared with men.In HF patients with impaired LVEF, significant gender differences are present, and the prognostic predictive values of some variables vary in magnitude between women and men. The survival advantage of women is confined to patients with nonischemic etiology."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rats develop hypertension and heart failure. We hypothesized that induction of hyperthyroidism should accelerate development of heart failure in male SHHF rats. Male and female SHHF rats received diets containing desiccated thyroid glands (DTG) or a control diet for 8 wk. Male and female Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as normotensive controls. DTG treatment reduced body weight in male, but not female, SHHF rats but increased body temperature and heart weight-to-body weight ratio in both genders. In DTG-treated male SHHF rats, serum triiodothyronine levels doubled relative to SHHF controls, whereas O2 consumption increased in DTG-treated SHHF rats. Frequency of breathing in air increased in DTG-treated female rats, and ventilation increased in DTG-treated male rats. Ventilatory equivalents exhibited gender differences in SHHF rats, were decreased in both genders by DTG treatment, and reached levels similar to those of Wistar-Kyoto rats. DTG increased heart rate, right ventricular pressure, and contractility in both genders and increased left ventricular pressure in SHHF male rats. These results refute our hypothesis and suggest that cardiopulmonary function of SHHF male rats may be improved by DTG treatment."Heart	Pathophysiology	"The goal of this study was to investigate plasma levels of myotrophin in heart failure (HF) and their relationship to gender and disease severity.Myotrophin is a myocardial hypertrophy-inducing factor initially demonstrated in hypertrophied and cardiomyopathic hearts. Recent evidence suggests an interaction with the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), which is activated in HF and modulates myocardial protein expression. It is unknown whether this peptide has an endocrine/paracrine role in man. We hypothesized that it may have a role in HF and would be raised in plasma.We developed a competitive binding assay specific for human myotrophin. Myotrophin was measured in plasma extracts of 120 HF patients and 130 age- and gender-matched normal controls.Myotrophin in plasma existed as the full-length 12 kD form with also a 2.7 kD form (possibly a degradation product). Log normalized myotrophin levels were significantly elevated in HF patients (mean +/- SEM [geometric mean, range], 2.402 +/- 0.021 [252, 72 to 933] vs. 2.268 +/- 0.021 [185, 28 to 501] fmol/ml, p < 0.0005). There was no relationship between myotrophin and age or gender in controls. However, males with HF had higher levels of myotrophin than females (p < 0.001). There was an inverse relationship of myotrophin levels with New York Heart Association class in patients with no gender difference in the relationship.There is evidence of early activation of the myotrophin system in HF, which is more evident in males. This response is attenuated in more severe disease. The contribution of myotrophin to NFkappaB-mediated gene transcription and preservation of cardiac muscle mass remains to be investigated further."Heart	Epidemiology	"To describe trends in hospital admissions and mortality from congestive heart failure in the elderly population aged 65 years and over in Singapore, 1991 to 1998.Analysis of trends and population subgroup differences in rates of hospital admission and mortality for a primary diagnosis of congestive heart failure, classified as ICD-9, codes 428, 402.0, 402.11, and 402.91.The state of Singapore (multiethnic population of three million: Chinese 77%, Malay 14%, Indian 8%).Congestive heart failure accounted for 4.5% of all hospital admissions and 2.5% of overall mortality in this age group. Age adjusted hospital admission rates for congestive heart failure increased by 38% (from 85.4 per 10 000 in 1991 to 110.3 per 10 000 in 1998), while mortality decreased by 20% (from 7.3 per 10 000 in 1991 to 6.1 per 10 000 in 1998). The decline in mortality was greater in women than in men. There were no sex differences in the rates of hospital admission, but there were significant ethnic differences in admissions and mortality. Thus hospital admissions for congestive heart failure were about 35% higher in both Malays and Indians than in Chinese; and mortality was 3.5 times higher in Malays, but was about the same in Indians and Chinese. Over the period studied, mortality from congestive heart failure declined in both Chinese and Indians, but rose in Malays. The increases in hospital admissions were similar in both sexes and all ethnic groups.An increasing rate of hospital admission accompanied by declining mortality from congestive heart failure is occurring in elderly people in this Asian multiethnic population. However, there are pronounced ethnic differences, with both Malays and Indians showing higher hospital admission rates than Chinese, and Malays showing a rising mortality as opposed to the falling mortality in the other ethnic groups."Heart	Review	"Recent studies have suggested some gender-related differences in the incidence, quality of care, response to therapy, and outcome in heart failure patients. The majority of studies have proposed a better survival for women compared to men. However, the under-representation of women in clinical trials leads to some uncertainty regarding the survival benefit. Some data suggest the possibility that ACE-inhibitors may be less beneficial in women as compared to men. Beta-blockers seem to be effective both in women and men. Further studies are needed to clarify whether these differences may have a pathophysiological basis."Heart	Clinical	"The aims of this study were to measure the N-terminal fragment of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (proBNP) in plasma in medical conditions commonly found in primary care and to evaluate the utility of these measurements in identifying impaired cardiac function in elderly patients with symptoms associated with heart failure.We studied 415 patients (221 men and 194 women; mean age, 72 years) who had contacted a primary healthcare center for dyspnea, fatigue, and/or peripheral edema. One cardiologist evaluated the patients in terms of history, physical examination, functional capacity, electrocardiography, and suspicion of heart failure. Plasma N-terminal proBNP was measured by an in-house RIA. An ejection fraction < or =40% by Doppler echocardiography was regarded as reduced cardiac function. Abnormal diastolic function was defined as an abnormal mitral inflow defined as reduced ratio of peak early diastolic filling velocity to peak filling velocity at atrial contraction (E/A ratio), or as abnormal pulmonary venous flow pattern.Patients with impaired functional capacity, impaired systolic function, and/or impaired renal function had significantly increased N-terminal proBNP concentrations. By multiple regression analysis, N-terminal proBNP concentrations were also influenced by ischemic heart disease, cardiac enlargement, and certain medications but not by increased creatinine. No gender differences were observed. Patients with isolated diastolic dysfunction attributable to relaxation abnormalities had lower concentrations than those with normal cardiac function, whereas those with pseudonormal E/A ratios or restrictive filling patterns had higher concentrations.Plasma N-terminal proBNP concentrations increase as a result of impaired systolic function, age, impaired renal function, cardiac ischemia and enlargement, and certain medications. Values are high in diastolic dysfunction with pseudonormal patterns, but not in patients with relaxation abnormalities. An increase in plasma N-terminal proBNP might be an earlier sign of abnormal cardiac function than abnormalities identified by currently used echocardiographic measurements."Heart	Pathophysiology	"The platelet-derived growth factors are implicated in development of fibrotic reactions and disease in several organs. We have overexpressed platelet-derived growth factor-C in the heart using the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter and created a transgenic mouse that exhibits cardiac fibrosis followed by hypertrophy with sex-dependent phenotypes. The transgenic mice developed several pathological changes including cardiac fibroblast proliferation and deposition of collagen, hypertrophy, vascular defects, and the presence of Anitschkow cells in the adult myocardium. Male mice developed a hypertrophic phenotype, whereas female mice were more severely affected and developed dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to heart failure and sudden death. The vascular defects initially included dilation of microvessels and vascular leakage. Subsequently, a marked loss of microvessels, formation of large vascular sac-like structures, and an increased density of smooth muscle-coated vessels were observed in the myocardium. In part, the observed vascular changes may be because of an up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor in cardiac fibroblasts of the transgenic hearts. This unique animal model reveals that a potent mitogen for cardiac fibroblasts result in an expansion of the interstitium that induce a secondary sex-dependent hypertrophic response in the cardiomyocytes."Heart	Review	"The aim of this literature review was to review and discuss the differences between men and women with heart failure with regard to epidemiology, aetiology, diagnostics, prognosis, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment, and the impact of heart failure on psychosocial factors and healthcare utilisation.Two primary health care resources, MEDLINE and CINAHL, were selected to review the current literature. In MEDLINE, 234 abstracts dealing with heart failure and gender/sex were found and in CINAHL, 20 abstracts.Men have a higher incidence of heart failure, but the overall prevalence rate is similar in both sexes, since women survive longer after the onset of heart failure. Women tend to be older when diagnosed with heart failure and more often have diastolic dysfunction than men. The extent of sex differences in treatment, hospital cost and quality of care can partly be explained by age differences. The life situations for men and women with heart failure are different. Physical and social restrictions affecting daily life activities are experienced as most bothersome for men, whereas restrictions affecting the possibility to support family and friends are most difficult to accept for women. Women with heart failure ascribe more positive meanings to their illness. Despite this, women seem to experience a lower overall quality of life than men. The known gender differences in patients with heart failure need to be highlighted in guidelines as well as implemented in standard care."Heart	Review	"Congestive heart failure represents a growing health issue with significant morbidity, expense, and mortality. Unfortunately, despite heart failure affecting men and women equally, women historically have represented a minority in heart failure trials. Despite this disparity, treatment decisions rely heavily on these trials. Women with heart failure often have different clinical features than men, such as age of onset and comorbidities. Compared with men, women also demonstrate differences in remodeling and the response to injury, such as volume or pressure overload and myocardial infarction. We are only beginning to understand the clinical implications of these gender differences and their impact on pharmacologic treatments. After discussing these differences, a review of the agents useful in systolic failure is made, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, b-blockers, digoxin, and aldosterone inhibition. Treatment of diastolic heart failure with empiric guidelines follows."Heart	Review	"No relevant sex-based differences in hemodynamic parameters have been described until now but the course of any heart disease may be modified by factors that act differently in men and women. In a study comparing the incidence of heart disease and patient survival over the past 50 years, the incidence of heart failure was found to have declined in women but not in men. With increased sodium excretion and obesity, the hazard ratios for cardiovascular mortality were higher in women. A post-hoc subgroup analysis of the DIG study was conducted to assess potential sex-based differences in the effect of digoxin. The authors conclude that digoxin therapy is associated with an increased risk of death in women (P = 0.34). The comparison of the effects of digoxin was limited simply to gender only and no other subgroup analyses were preformed although the characteristics of the patients show significant differences in more than 20 parameters. Hence, the conclusion of these authors can hardly be accepted. Contrary to these partly conflicting data, the primary results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial focused on defining the risks and benefits of hormone replacement in postmenopausal women give an unambiguous answer: combined estrogen/progestin therapy should not be initiated or continued for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease, furthermore, it increases the risks of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, venous thromboembolism and biliary tract surgery."Heart	Management	"Unlike other cardiovascular diseases the incidence and prevalence of congestive heart failure (CHF) continues to increase. While gender differences in coronary artery disease have been well described, to date, there has been a relative paucity of similar data in patients with CHF. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the profile and management of patients with CHF at a tertiary care centre to determine if a gender difference exists.A chart review was performed at a tertiary care centre on consecutive patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of CHF between June 1997 and 1998. Co-morbidity, diagnostic investigations, and management of CHF were recorded. Comparisons between male and female patients were conducted.One hundred and forty five patients were reviewed. There were 80 male (M) and 65 female (F) patients of similar age [71.6 vs. 71.3 (M vs. F), p = NS]. Male patients were more likely to have had a previous myocardial infarction (66% vs. 35%, p < 0.01) and revascularization (41% vs. 20%, p < 0.05), and had worse left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) than women, [median LVEF 3 vs. 2 (M vs. F), p < 0.01]. Male patients were more likely to have a non-invasive assessment of left ventricular (LV) function [85% vs. 69%, (M vs. F), p < 0.05]. A logistic regression analysis suggests that amongst those without coronary disease, males were more likely to receive non-invasive testing. There were no differences in the use of prescribed medications, in this cohort.This pilot study demonstrated that there seem to be important gender differences in the profile and management of patients with CHF. Importantly women were less likely to have an evaluation of LV function. As assessment of LV function has significant implications on patient management, this data justifies the need for larger studies to assess gender differences in CHF profile and treatment."Heart	Management	"The authors identified 321 elderly Kansas Medicaid patients with congestive heart failure and examined angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use. Using retrospective claims data, ACE inhibitor use was quantified and daily doses compared to a target enalapril-equivalent dose of 20 mg. The cohort patients averaged 80 years of age, 84% were female, and 70% resided primarily in a nursing home. Only 37.8% received an ACE inhibitor. Users were younger than nonusers (t=2.00; p=0.046), but there was no gender difference (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73, 2.6). ACE inhibitor users averaged eight prescriptions annually, providing approximately 257 medication days (70% of the study period). The average enalapril-equivalent daily dose was 10.6 mg, and only 22% received the target dose. Nursing home residents were less likely to receive an ACE inhibitor than ambulatory patients (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34, 0.89) but equally likely to receive target doses (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.34, 4.9). ACE inhibitor use in the Kansas Medicaid congestive heart failure population is not consistent with practice guidelines, particularly among older and/or nursing home patients."Heart	Review	"The pathogenesis, clinical course, and treatment of chronic heart failure (HF) are different in elderly women from those of patients recruited in the landmark trials of chronic HF. Patients included in these landmark trials were predominantly men whose age was 10-15 years younger than the average age of patients with chronic HF in the United States. Diastolic dysfunction resulting in impaired left ventricular (LV) filling is the preponderant LV functional alteration that leads to chronic HF in elderly women. Gender differences in the LV remodeling process that accompanies chronic cardiac pressure are likely to be responsible for the preponderance of LV diastolic dysfunction over systolic dysfunction in elderly women. In response to chronic pressure overload, the LV wall becomes thicker in women than in men. Consequently, in response to chronic pressure overload, women are able to normalize LV wall stress and preserve LV systolic function to a greater extent than men. However, impaired LV filling is an undesirable consequence of the greater increase in LV wall thickness in women. Thus, clinical observations and therapeutic guidelines derived from data collected in the landmark trials of chronic HF may not apply to elderly women with chronic HF. In view of the lack of evidence-based information needed to guide the management of elderly women with chronic HF, special attention should be given to include a substantial number of elderly women in future therapeutic trials recruiting patients with chronic HF."Heart	Epidemiology	"To study the prevalence, patient characteristics and management of patients with heart failure, and the feasibility of using everyday electronic patient records for research.A 4-year retrospective database study.Primary health care in Stockholm.Forty-six general practitioners, with a registered population of 100,222 inhabitants.Number of patients with heart failure, frequencies of their comorbidity, investigations and treatments.Out of the registered population, 667 (0.7%) patients had the diagnosis heart failure and fulfilled the diagnostic criteria in our study, and 98.7% had a comorbidity. The most frequent were ischaemic heart disease (37.2%), hypertension (27.3%), chronic atrial fibrillation (23.7%) and diabetes (22.3%). Major investigations were chest radiograph (66.3%) and echocardiograph (16.9%). Frequent pharmacological treatments were diuretics (90.9%), cardiac glycosides (48.1%), platelet aggregation inhibitors (32.7%), vasodilators (31.6%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (27.4%) and beta blockers (14.5%). Diuretics were more frequent for females (p = 0.016) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for males (p < 0.001).Heart failure was common among the elderly and constituted a complex clinical problem. It seemed that these patients could have been managed more adequately. There were gender differences concerning comorbidity and management. Electronic patient records were feasible for research, although several areas needed improvement."Heart	Management	"The Digitalis Investigation Group trial reported that treatment with digoxin did not decrease overall mortality among patients with heart failure and depressed left ventricular systolic function, although it did reduce hospitalizations slightly. Even though the epidemiologic features, causes, and prognosis of heart failure vary between men and women, sex-based differences in the effect of digoxin were not evaluated.We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis to assess whether there were sex-based differences in the effect of digoxin therapy among the 6800 patients in the Digitalis Investigation Group study. The presence of an interaction between sex and digoxin therapy with respect to the primary end point of death from any cause was evaluated with the use of Mantel-Haenszel tests of heterogeneity and a multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model, adjusted for demographic and clinical variables.There was an absolute difference of 5.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 11.1) between men and women in the effect of digoxin on the rate of death from any cause (P=0.034 for the interaction). Specifically, women who were randomly assigned to digoxin had a higher rate of death than women who were randomly assigned to placebo (33.1 percent vs. 28.9 percent; absolute difference, 4.2 percent, 95 percent confidence interval, -0.5 to 8.8). In contrast, the rate of death was similar among men randomly assigned to digoxin and men randomly assigned to placebo (35.2 percent vs. 36.9 percent; absolute difference, -1.6 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -4.2 to 1.0). In the multivariable analysis, digoxin was associated with a significantly higher risk of death among women (adjusted hazard ratio for the comparison with placebo, 1.23; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.47), but it had no significant effect among men (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.02; P=0.014 for the interaction).The effect of digoxin therapy differs between men and women. Digoxin therapy is associated with an increased risk of death from any cause among women, but not men, with heart failure and depressed left ventricular systolic function."Heart	Outcomes	"Heart failure (HF) dramatically affects the lives of both patients and their caregivers, yet limited research exists examining the relationship between emotional well-being of HF patients and their caregivers. Therefore, we conducted a study to (1) describe and compare the emotional well-being of HF patients and their caregivers, (2) determine if gender differences exist in emotional well-being of patients and caregivers, and (3) identify factors associated with emotional well-being of HF patients.The emotional well-being of 103 patient-caregiver dyads was assessed using the mental health subscale of the SF-12.Patients were 57.6 +/- 12.1 years, predominantly Caucasian (76.7%) and male (67.0%). Caregivers were 59.5 +/- 17.6 years, predominantly females (70.9%) and spouses of patients with HF (82.6%). Patients had significantly lower (poorer) emotional well-being scores than caregivers. Both gender and age were associated with patients' emotional well-being; male and younger participants had higher (better) scores than female and older patients (P <.05). In a multivariate model, patient's age, gender, and caregivers' emotional well-being accounted for 54% of the variance in patients' emotional well-being.We found that the emotional well-being of caregivers is associated with the emotional well-being of HF patients. Our findings suggest the need to focus on supporting caregivers and providing them with the strategies they need to support their loved ones with HF."Heart	Clinical	"Although several studies indicate that there are gender differences in left ventricular (LV) systolic function, it remains unclear whether similar differences exist with regard to diastolic function. Accordingly, Doppler echocardiograms were analyzed in 515 male and 839 female, mostly treated (95%) hypertensive participants enrolled in the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) study with no evidence of abnormal wall motion or significant valvular heart disease. There was no difference in age between genders, but after adjusting for age and race, men had lower body mass indexes (29.8 +/- 5.2 vs 32.3 +/- 7.6 kg/m(2)) and heart rates (67 +/- 12 vs 69 +/- 11 beats/min) and higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) than women (134 +/- 20 vs 130 +/- 21 and 80 +/- 11 vs 72 +/- 11 mm Hg, all p <0.001). LV mass/height(2.7) was slightly greater in women than in men (43 +/- 10 vs 42 +/- 9 g/m(2.7), p <0.05). After adjusting for age, race, systolic BP, body mass index, heart rate, and LV hypertrophy, both mitral E-wave (70 +/- 18 vs 77 +/- 19) and A-wave (74 +/- 15 vs 79 +/- 17, both p <0.001) velocities were lower in men than in women, but the mitral E/A ratio and atrial filling fraction were nearly identical in both genders. Deceleration time (221 +/- 55 vs 214 +/- 46 cm/s, p = 0.018) and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) were longer in men than in women (85 +/- 18 vs 81 +/- 17 cm/s, p <0.001). Prolonged IVRT was present in more men than women (14% vs 7%, p <0.05). In analyses of covariance, adjusting for age, race, systolic BP, body mass index, heart rate, and medications, male gender remained related to prolonged deceleration time and IVRT. Thus, in this population-based sample of hypertensive adults, men had evidence of slower early diastolic LV filling than women. This gender difference in diastolic function may provide insight into gender differences in congestive heart failure and other specific cardiovascular diseases."Heart	Outcomes	"Psychological distress and marital quality were assessed with male (n = 128) and female (n = 49) congestive-heart-failure (CHF) patients and their spouses. Hopkins Symptom Check List--25 scores were in the distressed range for 57% of patients and 40% of spouses. This role difference was greater for men than for women, and a gender difference (more distress in women than men) was greater for spouses than for patients. The patient's distress, but not the spouse's, reflected the severity of the patient's illness, and distress for both partners correlated negatively with ratings of marital quality. Female-patient couples reported better relationship quality than male-patient couples, however, and a mediation analysis indicated that the gender difference in spouse distress could be explained by marital quality. Results highlight the contextual nature of CHF distress and suggest that role differences in distress vary by gender."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Sexual dimorphism may occur during the development of hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF). Male and female spontaneous hypertension heart failure (SHHF) rats with established hypertension, but before CHF (age 5-8 mo) and during cardiac decompensation leading to CHF (age 18-20 mo in male rats and 22-24 mo in female rats), were studied. At 5-8 mo, male SHHF rats showed early activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), as indicated by increased plasma renin activity (PRA) and higher serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity compared with female rats. The increase in PRA in female rats was delayed compared with males rats, but it reached comparable levels just before CHF. Urinary endothelin excretion was significantly greater in 5- to 8-mo-old female rats compared with age-matched male rats. Urinary endothelin excretion increased in both male and female rats as CHF developed. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was comparable at both time points, and both genders showed similar, marked increases as CHF developed. In conclusion, male rats show early activation of the RAS, whereas female rats show early activation of the endothelin vasopressor system. During cardiac decompensation, generalized activation of the RAS, endothelin, and ANP systems occurs and is similar in male and female SHHF rats."Heart	Review	"In the effort to explain gender-related differences of the cardiovascular system, the renin-angiotensin system experienced intensive exploration. Indeed, the development of hypertension as well as the progression of coronary artery disease and heart failure have two factors in common: (1) display distinct gender specific characteristics and (2) are enhanced by the renin-angiotensin system. It is therefore interesting to note that data from experimental animals, epidemiological surveys, and clinical investigations suggest that the components of the circulating as well as tissue-based renin-angiotensin system are markedly affected by gender. However, the issue is complicated by counter-regulatory effects of estrogen on the system with the substrate, on one hand, and the processing enzymes as well as the chief receptor, on the other hand. In fact, angiotensinogen is up-regulated particularly by oral administration of estrogen, whereas renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and AT-1 receptor are down-regulated by the hormone. While under well-defined experimental conditions the net effect of estrogen appears to result in suppression of the renin-angiotensin system, the clinical situation may be more complex. The judgment is further complicated by the difficulty in precisely measuring the activity of the system at the tissue level. Moreover, clinically relevant read-outs for the activity of the renin-angiotensin system may be regulated multifactorially or only indirectly affected by the system. Nevertheless, the undisputable, profound biochemical changes in the renin-angiotensin system related to the estrogen status allow speculation that such interaction explains some of the differences in the cardiovascular system of men and women."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Recent studies suggest that female gender is associated with a lower prevalence and a more benign prognosis of heart failure. In the current population-based study, it was our objective to evaluate the implications of gender on the association between impaired left ventricular (LV) function and mass as well as neurohumoral activation.A total of 1883 subjects (992 female, 891 male) of two MONICA surveys in Augsburg, Germany, were analyzed. Participants of one of these surveys were additionally characterized with respect to neurohormonal activation. As compared to men, women were characterized by a slightly higher LV ejection fraction (EF, Teichholz-Method, 65.4 +/- 0.3% vs. 63.4 +/- 0.3, P<0.01) and a markedly lower LV mass index (LVMI 81 +/- 1 g/m(2) vs. 96 +/- 1, P<0.01). As compared to men with normal LV function, those with LV dysfunction (EF below mean minus two standard deviations, S.D.) were characterized by significantly increased LV mass (LVMI +48%, P<0.01), plasma BNP (+373%, P<0.01) and ANP (+57%, P<0.01), while no significant changes were observed in women (LVMI +3%, BNP +48%, ANP +27%, all P=n.s). Only a small subgroup of women with severe LVD (EF below mean - 3 S.D.) was characterized by significantly increased LV mass (LVMI +23%, P<0.05 vs. control and LVD), however, this increase was less pronounced as compared to men with severe LVD (LVMI +46%, P<0.01 vs. control). Gender-specific differences between LV function and structure were also confirmed by multivariate analysis. While LVMI was independently and significantly correlated with EF in male subjects in addition to systolic blood pressure, age, and body mass index (all P<0.01), these parameters displaced EF as a predictor of LVMI in female subjects.Men with moderate or severe LV dysfunction are characterized by an increase in both LV mass and cardiac natriuretic peptide plasma concentrations. In contrast, LV mass and natriuretic peptide concentrations increase to a lesser extent and only with severe LV dysfunction in women. These observational data suggest gender-specific control of myocardial adaptations to hemodynamic overload and a more rapid induction of LV hypertrophy during myocardial dysfunction in male subjects."Heart	Outcomes	"The primary aim of this study was to describe and compare the experience of fatigue in a group of elderly women and men with severe chronic heart failure. A sample of 158 patients (66 women and 92 men, with a mean age of 83 and 78 years, respectively) was invited to participate in a study on admission to a hospital outpatient heart failure clinic. A registered nurse interviewed patients using a modified version of the Fatigue Interview Schedule (FIS). Descriptions of the experiences of fatigue generally showed good agreement between men and women; however, some gender differences were found. Women expressed a clear role to fulfil because they were engaged in maintenance activities of their household. Although we still have only limited knowledge about the impact of gender on the experiences and coping strategies in disease and aging, it is important for care providers to consider gender differences when planning caring interventions."Heart	Clinical	"Human urotensin II (UTN) has potent vasoactive and cardiostimulatory effects, acting on the G protein-linked receptor GPR14. Myocardial UTN expression is upregulated in heart failure, and UTN stimulates myocardial expression of the natriuretic peptides. We investigated plasma UTN levels in heart failure (HF; left ventricular systolic dysfunction) in comparison with plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (N-BNP) levels.N-BNP and UTN were measured in plasma from 126 patients with HF and 220 age- and sex-matched controls. Both peptides were elevated in plasma of HF patients and were correlated (r(s)=0.35, P<0.001). In contrast to N-BNP, there was no relationship of plasma UTN with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. Although plasma N-BNP showed a positive relationship with age and female sex, there was no such age-dependent change in plasma UTN, and control women had lower levels compared with control men. Receiver operating characteristic curves for the diagnosis of HF had areas of 0.90 and 0.86 for N-BNP and UTN, respectively (P<0.001 for both). Receiver operating characteristic curve area for diagnosis of NYHA class I HF with UTN was better than that with N-BNP.Plasma UTN is elevated in HF, which suggests a pathophysiological role for this peptide. Plasma UTN may be a useful alternative to N-BNP in the diagnosis of HF, inasmuch as its levels are elevated irrespective of age, sex, or NYHA class."Heart	Outcomes	"The propensity to develop specific arrhythmias varies between the sexes. Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) have a high prevalence of ventricular ectopy. However, it is not known if sex related differences exist in the susceptibility to arrhythmias in the setting of CHF. The study population included 159 men and 77 women (mean age 61 +/- 14 years) admitted for decompensated CHF. The severity of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias was assessed by 24-hour Holter monitoring. None of the patients were on parenteral vasoactive therapy during Holter recording. All measures of ventricular ectopy were markedly lower in women compared to men. The mean hourly ventricular pairs (283 +/- 67 vs 106 +/- 30, P = 0.04), mean hourly repetitive ventricular beats (28 +/- 7 vs 10 +/- 3, P = 0.04), and the frequency of ventricular tachycardia episodes per 24 hours (31 +/- 9 vs 7 +/- 3, P = 0.01) were significantly lower in women. After inclusion of clinical variables and drug therapies in a multivariate analysis, the negative relationship between female sex and the frequency of ventricular pairs (P = 0.04), repetitive ventricular beats (P = 0.04), and ventricular tachycardia episodes (P = 0.0005) remained independent. No differences in atrial ectopy between men and woman were found. Complex ventricular ectopy and episodes of ventricular tachycardia are significantly lower in women with CHF. Whether these finding are relevant to female survival advantage in the setting of heartfailure can only be determined by a prospective study. Further understanding of the mechanisms involved in the protection conferred by the patient's sex would advance our understanding about arrhythmias in heart failure."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Gender differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, both clinical and experimental, led us to evaluate the influence of gender on ventricular remodeling induced by chronic volume overload.Chronic volume overload was induced in male and female rats via infrarenal aortocaval fistula. Ventricular function was assessed 8 weeks after fistula surgery in surviving rats. Left ventricular, right ventricular, and lung weights were measured. Mortality in female rats was 10-fold less than in male rats after 8 weeks of volume overload. Both sexes had significant increases in left ventricular weights relative to controls (77% increase for female v 114% for male rats; P <.05). Corresponding increases were also observed in right ventricular weight (134% for female v 161% for male rats; P <.05). However, lung weight was significantly increased only in males. In contrast to males, female rats had no indications of congestive heart failure. Male rats had marked dilatation and increased compliance, whereas female rats had no significant change in left ventricular dilatation or compliance.There are clear gender-specific differences in ventricular function, structural remodeling, and mortality induced by chronic volume overload in this model of heart failure."Heart	Outcomes	"The goal of this study was to determine whether gender differences exist in health perceptions, psychosocial adjustment to illness, and concerns related to illness in patients with heart failure (HF).Thirty-two patients (50% women) from a single outpatient HF clinic were asked to complete standardized tools to assess health perceptions and psychosocial adjustment to illness. Open-ended questions were used to obtain data on concerns related to HF.The women had higher health perceptions than men did; they also demonstrated better psychosocial adjustment to illness. The qualitative data further suggest that women ascribed more positive meanings to their illness than men did.The current study underscored the importance of gender differences in health perceptions related to HF. Patient teaching and counseling can be tailored to address the gender-specific concerns of men and women suffering with this condition to improve patient outcomes."Heart	Outcomes	"The purpose of this study was to evaluate gender differences in quality of life (QOL) in a large sample of age-matched and ejection fraction (EF)-matched patients with heart failure.Matched comparisons of secondary data were used.The setting consisted of multicenter Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction trials.The sample included 1382 patients (691 men and 691 women) who were age-matched and EF-matched.Global QOL and the QOL dimensions of physical function, emotional distress, social health, and general health were measured using the Ladder of Life, items from the Profile of Mood States Inventory, the Functional Status Questionnaire, the beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial instrument, and an item from the RAND Medical Outcomes Study instrument.Women had significantly worse general life satisfaction, physical function, and social and general health scores than men. There were no significant differences found between gender groups for current life situation or emotional distress. After controlling for New York Heart Association classification, women still had significantly worse ratings for intermediate activities of daily living (a sub-dimension of physical functioning) and social activity.Despite controlling for age, EF, and New York Heart Association classification, women had worse QOL ratings than did men for intermediate activities of daily living and social activity. Research should focus on identifying why differences exist and developing measures to improve QOL, particularly physical functioning, in women with heart failure."Heart	Management	"The aim of the present study was to describe patients considered to have had heart failure (HF), or were being treated for HF, in a defined area in primary health care, e.g. diagnostic procedures, aetiologic diseases and management, and to evaluate whether there is a difference between the genders.Descriptive retrospective investigation.Atvidaberg community situated in southeast Sweden, 12 400 inhabitants.256 patients treated for symptomatic HF.Prevalence, aetiology, diagnostic procedures and management of HF and differences between the genders.The diagnosis of HF was based on an objective evaluation of cardiac function in only 31% of the patients. Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was the predominant associated disease, followed by hypertension. Therapy included diuretics (84%), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (56%) and digoxin (40%). Only 52% had optimal doses of ACE inhibitors. Women had a significantly higher mean age and their diagnoses were based on an objective diagnostic test (echocardiography) in only 20%. Women were prescribed ACE inhibitors to a lesser extent (43%) than men (64%) and with a lower optimal dose (44% versus 56% in men).There is still room for improvement in the management of HF in primary health care, especially in women, where the diagnosis is not generally based on an objective evaluation of cardiac function and where the treatment to a lesser extent than in men includes ACE inhibitors."Heart	Pathophysiology	"To determine whether selective impairment of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) transport may drive the progressive functional deterioration leading to heart failure, transgenic mice, overexpressing a phospholamban Val(49) --> Gly mutant (2-fold), which is a superinhibitor of SR Ca(2+)-ATPase affinity for Ca(2+), were generated, and their cardiac phenotype was examined longitudinally. At 3 months of age, the increased EC(50) level of SR Ca(2+) uptake for Ca(2+) (0.67 +/- 0.09 microm) resulted in significantly higher depression of cardiomyocyte rates of shortening (57%), relengthening (31%), and prolongation of the Ca(2+) signal decay time (165%) than overexpression (2-fold) of wild type phospholamban (68%, 64%, and 125%, respectively), compared with controls (100%). Echocardiography also revealed significantly depressed function and impaired beta-adrenergic responses in mutant hearts. The depressed contractile parameters were associated with left ventricular remodeling, recapitulation of fetal gene expression, and hypertrophy, which progressed to dilated cardiomyopathy with interstitial tissue fibrosis and death by 6 months in males. Females also had ventricular hypertrophy at 3 months but exhibited normal systolic function up to 12 months of age. These results suggest a causal relationship between defective SR Ca(2+) cycling and cardiac remodeling leading to heart failure, with a gender-dependent influence on the time course of these alterations."Heart	Management	"Whether female sex is associated with a better prognosis in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) remains uncertain. The Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS) II showed that bisoprolol reduced all-cause mortality and morbidity rates in CHF patients treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. We examined whether survival was different in men (n=2132) and women (n=515) enrolled in CIBIS II.Women differed from men with regard to age, NYHA functional classification, primary cause of CHF, and risk factors such as left bundle-branch block. After adjustment for baseline differences, the probability of all-cause mortality was significantly reduced by 36% in women compared with that in men (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.86, P:=0.003). Women also had a 39% reduction in cardiovascular deaths (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.91, P:=0.01) and a 70% reduction in deaths from pump failure (hazard ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.70, P:=0.005) compared with men. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality among women treated with bisoprolol compared with men (6% versus 12% P:=0.01) but not among women treated with placebo (13% versus 18%, P:=0.10). However, this sex/ss-blocker effect was not significant in multivariate analysis.These results indicate that regardless of ss-blocker treatment and baseline clinical profile, female sex is a significant independent predictor of survival in patients with CHF."Heart	Epidemiology	"We assessed gender differences in the risk of mortality in heart failure (HF) patients and evaluated the association between HF drug treatment and mortality.We identified a cohort of 820 patients with newly diagnosed HF in 1996 in UK general practices. The diagnosis of HF was confirmed by the general practitioner. Fifty per cent were females and 27% were less than 70 years old. During a mean follow-up of 2 years, 172 patients died. We used computerized records to assess risk factors and drugs prescribed as treatment. The information on severity was assessed through a questionnaire. We performed a nested case-control analysis, and observed that men had twice the risk of dying than females, however the effect of age on mortality was stronger in females than males. We found a similar interaction between HF severity and sex. Data on use of some cardiovascular drugs such as diuretics, beta-blockers ACE-inhibitors and calcium channel blockers were suggestive of a reduced mortality risk. Current use of nitrates and glycosides carried an increased risk.Older age, male sex and severity of HF were the main predictors of mortality among HF patients. Long-term use of beta-blockers was associated with a significantly reduced risk of mortality."Heart	Review	"Heart failure affects more than 5 million Americans. Each year, about 400,000 individuals develop heart failure, making it the nation's most rapidly growing cardiac problem. Almost one third of these individuals have New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV heart failure and are faced with progressive clinical deterioration and frequent hospital admissions. These figures will continue to escalate as the population ages. The success of interventional procedures and pharmacologic therapies in the management of coronary artery disease has enabled this population to survive acute events, at the same time creating a population with chronic disease. Common etiologies of heart failure in women include coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and valvular disease. However, women are at especially high risk for developing heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction associated with hypertension and diabetes. Heart failure in women is best managed across the care continuum, incorporating pharmacologic agents, interventional procedures when appropriate, dietary restrictions, self-monitoring, and psychosocial support. Much of the recent literature has focused on women and heart disease. This emphasis is partly due to public misconception about women's health problems and the growing body of research distinguishing gender differences. Significant advances in therapy have been made to improve the quality and span of life for people with heart disease. Despite therapeutic advances, however, women have high mortality rates from heart disease, including heart failure due to ischemic causes. In fact, women with heart failure present differently than men and have different etiologies and treatment options. As we learn more about women and heart disease, the distinguishing differences unfold and become helpful in establishing a plan of care."Heart	Pathophysiology	"The prognosis of women with congestive heart failure (CHF) is better than that for men, but the mechanisms underlying the female survival advantage are not well understood. CHF is characterized by profound abnormalities in cardiac autonomic control that contribute to progressive circulatory failure and influence survival.Time- and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) indexes were obtained from 24-hour Holter recordings and compared to assess the role of gender in 131 men and 68 women with CHF (mean age 60 +/- 13.6 years, range 21 to 87; New York Heart Association Functional Class III [66%] and IV [34%]). Gender-related differences in HRV were observed only in the subset of patients with nonischemic heart failure (55 men and 39 women). Among the time-domain indexes, the SD of the RR intervals (76 +/- 5.3 msec vs 55.3 +/- 3.2 msec, P < 0.0001) and indexes denoting parasympathetic modulation, the percentage of RR intervals with >50 msec variation (4.0% +/- 1.0% vs 6.5% +/- 1.3%, P = 0.02), and the square root of mean squared differences of successive RR intervals (19.1 +/- 3.3 vs 28.4 +/- 3.8, P = 0.004) were higher in women. Among the frequency-domain indexes, the total power (7.5 +/- 0.13 ln-msec2 vs 8.3 +/- 0.14 ln-msec2, P = 0.0002), the ultralow-frequency power (7.2 +/- 0.11 ln-msec2 vs 8.0 +/- 0.14 In-msec2, P < 0.0001), the low-frequency power (3.8 +/- 0.25 ln-msec2 vs 4.8 +/- 0.28 ln-msec2, P = 0.006), and the high-frequency power (3.8 +/- 0.24 ln-msec2, vs 4.6 +/- 0.26 ln-msec2, P = 0.003) were greater in women than in men.Women with nonischemic CHF have an attenuated sympathetic activation and parasympathetic withdrawal compared with men. Gender-based differences in autonomic responses in the setting of CHF may be related to the female survival advantage."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Telomerase replaces telomeric repeat DNA lost during the cell cycle, restoring telomere length. This enzyme is present only during cell replication and its activity reflects the extent of proliferation. Whether cardiac myocytes are terminally differentiated cells is still a highly controversial issue, and the possibility of myocyte division is frequently rejected. On this basis, telomerase was measured in pure preparations of myocytes, isolated from rats throughout their lifespan. Fetal and neonatal rat myocytes were used as positive control cells. Contrary to expectation, the authors report that telomerase activity was detectable in pure preparations of young adult, fully mature adult, and senescent ventricular myocytes, defeating the dogma that this cell population is permanent and irreplaceable. Aging decreased 31% telomerase activity in male myocytes. An opposite effect occurred in female myocytes in which this enzyme increased 72%. This differential adaptation between the two genders in the rat model may be relevant to observations in humans; myocyte loss occurs in men as a function of age, whereas myocyte number is preserved in women. The greater growth potential of female myocytes may be critical for the longer lifespan and decreased incidence of heart failure in women."Heart	Management	"Heart failure is a serious, common, and growing problem. Hospital admissions, which account for the bulk of health service costs associated with heart failure, are becoming more frequent.To determine whether management of heart failure differs by age and sex.A retrospective case note review of prevalent cases in 16 general practices in West London. Five hundred and eighty-three patients (57% women) with a diagnosis of heart failure were reviewed.Mean age of patients with heart failure was 78 years (SD = 9.5)--74 years at diagnosis (SD = 10)--and was higher for women than men (76 years versus 71 years, P < 0.001). In 32% of patients there was no record of a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, or echocardiogram to support diagnosis. Echocardiography, performed in 34% of patients, was less likely in older patients in both sexes (test for trend P = 0.04 in women and 0.02 in men) and, overall, in women (29% compared with 40% of men, P = 0.006). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment, recorded in 54% of patients, decreased with age in both sexes (P < 0.001) and, on unadjusted data, was more likely in men than in women (61% compared with 49%, P = 0.005). On adjustment for age, sex differences in the use of echocardiography and ACE inhibitors were reduced and no longer significant.With increasing age, men and women with heart failure were less likely to have undergone echocardiography or to have received an ACE inhibitor. When account was taken of age, there were no statistically significant sex differences in management; however, because of the demographic distribution of heart failure, women are disproportionately affected by age differences in management. Clinical trials, physician practice, and service developments in heart failure have neglected older people. This balance should be redressed."Heart	Epidemiology	"Increasing prevalence, use of health services, and number of deaths have made congestive heart failure (CHF) a new epidemic in the United States. Yet there are no adequate data to guide treatment of the more typical and complex cases of patients who are very old and frail.Using the SAGE database, we studied the cases of 86,094 patients with CHF admitted to any of the 1492 long-term care facilities of 5 states from 1992 through 1996. We described their clinical and functional characteristics and their pharmacologic treatment to verify agreement with widely approved guidelines. We evaluated age- and sex-related differences, and we determined predictors of receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor by developing a multiple logistic regression model.The mean age of the population was 84.9 +/- 8 years. Eighty percent of the patients 85 years of age or older were women. More than two thirds of patients underwent frequent hospitalizations related to CHF in the year preceding admission to a long-term care facility. Coronary heart disease and hypertension were the most common causes. Half of the patients received digoxin and 45% a diuretic, regardless of background cardiovascular comorbidities. Only 25% of patients had a prescription for ACE inhibitors. The presence of cardiovascular comorbidity, already being a recipient of a large number of medications, a previous hospitalization for CHF, and admission to the facility in recent years were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving an ACE inhibitor. The presence of severe physical limitation was inversely related to use of ACE inhibitors, as were a series of organizational factors related to the facilities.Patients in long-term care who have CHF little resemble to those enrolled in randomized trials. This circumstance may explain, at least in part, the divergence from pharmacologic management consensus guidelines. Yet the prescription of ACE inhibitors varies significantly across facilities and depends on organizational characteristics."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Ischemic heart disease is more prevalent in men than in women. The remodeling of extracellular matrix, is a structural correlate of heart failure of ischemic origin and proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts is a key factor in this remodeling. We asked if proliferative response of male and female cardiac fibroblasts is differentially susceptible to hypoxia. DNA synthesis, using 3H-thymidine incorporation was compared under hypoxia (2% O2) in cardiac fibroblasts obtained from adult, age-matched male and female rat heart. In female cells DNA synthesis remained unchanged under hypoxia and this resistance was dependent on tyrosine kinase activation, as it was abolished in the presence of genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Male cells, on the other hand, were susceptible to hypoxia and their DNA synthesis was reduced significantly (70%, (p < 0.0001). This effect was partially reversed by inhibition of tyrosine kinase. Western analysis showed a higher abundance of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in male cells compared to female cells as well as differences in molecular weight of basal and hypoxia-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins between male and female cells. The presence of estrogen (17-beta estradiol, 10 nM) altered the response of both cells to hypoxia. In female cells the combined effect of hypoxia and estrogen led to inhibition of DNA synthesis, whereas in male cells estrogen partially reversed the hypoxia-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis (37% (p < 0.01) inhibition in the presence of estrogen vs. 70% (p < 0.0001) inhibition in the absence of estrogen). The effects of estrogen in male and female cells were mediated via estrogen receptors as they were reversed by the pure anti-estrogen, ICI 182,780. Western analysis of cell lysate showed hypoxia-induced increase in the level of estrogen receptor beta in both male and female cells. Gel shift analysis showed hypoxia-induced increase in cytoplasmic ERE (estrogen response element)-binding activity and decrease in nuclear ERE-binding in male cells. In female cells cytoplasmic and nuclear ERE-binding activities remained unchanged under hypoxia. Together, these data demonstrate that while female cells are resistant to hypoxia-induced inhibition in DNA synthesis, male cells are susceptible; intracellular pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation are involved in the response of both cells; and estrogen, via estrogen-receptor-dependent mechanisms, differentially alters the response of male and female cells to hypoxia."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Epidemiological evidence suggests that the prognosis of heart failure in women is better than in men. In our murine model of dilated cardiomyopathy arising from cardiac-specific overexpression of TNF-alpha, the 6-month survival rate was significantly better in females than in males. Young female transgenic mice exhibited left ventricular wall thickening without dilatation, whereas age-matched male transgenic hearts were markedly dilated. Basal and isoproterenol-stimulated fractional shortening was preserved in female transgenic mice, but not in male transgenic mice. Myocardial expression of proinflammatory cytokines and the extent of myocardial infiltrates were similar in male and female transgenic mice. Myocardial expression of TNF-receptor mRNAs (type I and type II) was significantly higher in male mice in both transgenic and wild-type littermates, whereas sex-specific differences were not observed in either peripheral white blood cells or liver tissue. After TNF-alpha challenge, myocardial but not liver production of ceramide was significantly higher in male than in female mice. Thus, differential expression of myocardial TNF receptors may contribute to sex differences in the severity of congestive heart failure and mortality consequent to cardiac-specific overexpression of TNF-alpha."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Cardiovascular disease is delayed and less common in women than in men. Myocyte death occurs in heart failure, but only apoptosis has been documented; the role of myocyte necrosis is unknown. Therefore, we tested whether necrosis is as important as apoptosis and whether myocyte death is lower in women than in men with heart failure. Molecular probes were used to measure the magnitude of myocyte necrosis and apoptosis in 7 women and 12 men undergoing transplantation for cardiac failure. Myocyte necrosis was evaluated by detection of DNA damage with blunt end fragments, whereas apoptosis was assessed by the identification of double-strand DNA cleavage with single base or longer 3' overhangs. An identical analysis of these forms of cell death was performed in control myocardium. Heart failure showed levels of myocyte necrosis 7-fold greater than apoptosis in patients of both sexes. However, cell death was 2-fold higher in men than in women. Heart failure resulted in a 13-fold and 27-fold increase in necrosis in women and men, respectively. Apoptosis increased 35-fold in women and 85-fold in men. The differences in cell death between women and men were confirmed by the electrophoretic pattern of DNA diffusion and laddering of isolated myocytes. The lower degree of cell death in women was associated with a longer duration of the myopathy, a later onset of cardiac decompensation, and a longer interval between heart failure and transplantation. In conclusion, myocyte necrosis and apoptosis affect the decompensated human heart; each contributes to the evolution of cardiac failure. However, the female heart is protected, at least in part, from necrotic and apoptotic death signals."Heart	Outcomes	"There is evidence for sex differences in treatment and outcome of ischemic heart disease. However, little and conflicting data exist about sex differences in the care and outcome of elderly patients with heart failure.We compared mortality rate, readmission, and use of selected treatments and procedures between women and men in a database of 2445 patients (1426 women) aged >/=65 admitted for heart failure to 18 Connecticut hospitals in 1994 and 1995. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from the medical records.Women were older and more likely to have a history of hypertension whereas men more often had previous coronary heart disease. Women had more preserved left ventricular systolic function and higher systolic blood pressure on presentation than men. Treatments on day 1 (aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, and diuretics), procedures during admission (assessment of left ventricular function, coronary angiography, and revascularization), and use of ACE inhibitors among ideal candidates at discharge were similar in men and women. Six-month rehospitalization rates were also similar. Although 30-day mortality rate did not differ between men and women, 6-month and 1-year mortality rates were lower in women after age adjustment (relative risk for 6-month death 0.81, 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.95). In multivariable analysis, sex differences in mortality rate were reduced (relative risk 0.90, 95% confidence intervals, 0.75-1.08). History of hypertension, systolic blood pressure on admission, and left ventricular function mostly explained the observed sex differences in mortality rate.Female and male patients hospitalized for heart failure have a similar hospital course, treatment pattern, and readmission rates, but women live longer than men. When baseline differences are accounted for, the mortality risk of women and men becomes very similar."Heart	Pathophysiology	"Gender-related differences responsible for the better prognosis of females with heart failure have not been clearly established. To address this issue, we investigated potential gender-related differences in myocyte remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive heart failure rats. Echocardiograms and myocyte growth were compared between males and females at compensated (2, 4, and 6 months) and decompensated (18 months in males and 24 months in females) stages of cardiac hypertrophy. Although left ventricular diastolic dimensions did not differ significantly between failing male and female rats, fractional shortening declined significantly only in failing males. Myocyte cross-sectional area did not change after 4 months of age in both genders, which is likely to be responsible for the absence of a change in left ventricular wall thickness during the progression to heart failure. Myocyte volume and cross-sectional area were significantly larger in males than females at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, although there were no significant differences at the failing stage. Reduced adaptive hypertrophic reserve was observed in males, which is likely to contribute to the higher morbidity and mortality of males with chronic heart failure."Heart	Management	"Variations in the rates of major procedures by race and gender are well described, but few studies have assessed the quality of care by race and gender for basic hospital services.To assess quality of care by race and gender.Retrospective review of medical records.Stratified random sample of 2,175 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for congestive heart failure or pneumonia in Illinois, New York, and Pennsylvania during 1991 and 1992.Explicit process criteria and implicit review by physicians.In adjusted analyses, black patients with congestive heart failure or pneumonia received lower quality of care overall than other patients with these conditions by both explicit process criteria and implicit review (P < 0.05). On explicit measures, overall quality of care did not differ by gender for either condition, but significant differences were noted on explicit subscales. Women received worse cognitive care than men from physicians for both conditions, better cognitive care from nurses for pneumonia, and better therapeutic care for congestive heart failure (P < 0.05). Women received worse quality of care than men by implicit review (P = 0.03) for congestive heart failure but not pneumonia.Consistent racial differences in quality of care persist in basic hospital services for two common medical conditions. Physicians, nurses, and policy makers should strive to eliminate these differences. Gender differences in quality of care are less pronounced and may vary by condition and type of provider or service."Heart	Outcomes	"Previous natural history studies in broad populations of heart failure patients have associated female gender with improved survival, particularly in patients with a nonischemic etiology of ventricular dysfunction. This study investigates whether a similar survival advantage for women would be evident among patients with advanced heart failure.The study analysis is based on the Flolan International Randomized Survival Trial (FIRST) study which enrolled 471 patients (359 men and 112 women) who had evidence of end-stage heart failure with marked symptoms (60% NYHA class IV) and severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction 18+/-4.9%). A Cox proportional-hazards model, adjusted for age, gender, 6-minute walk, dobutamine use at randomization, mean pulmonary artery blood pressure, and treatment assignment, showed a significant association between female gender and better survival (relative risk of death for men versus women was 2.18, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.41; P<0.001). Although formal interaction testing was negative (P=0.275), among patients with a nonischemic etiology of heart failure, the relative risk of death for men versus women was 3.08 (95% CI 1.56 to 6.09, P=0.001), whereas among those with ischemic heart disease, the relative risk of death for men versus women was 1.64 (95% CI 0.87 to 3.09, P=0.127).Women with advanced heart failure appear to have better survival than men. Subgroup analysis suggests this finding is strongest among patients with a nonischemic etiology of heart failure."Heart	Pathophysiology	"To identify gender differences in left ventricular remodeling, hypertrophy, and function in response to pressure overload due to ascending aortic banding in rats.Gender may influence the adaptation to pressure overload, as women with aortic stenosis have greater degrees of left ventricular hypertrophy and better left ventricular function than men.Fifty-two weanling rats underwent ascending aortic banding (16 males, 18 females), or sham surgery (9 males, 9 females). At 6 and 20 weeks, rats underwent transthoracic echo Doppler studies, and closed-chest left ventricular pressures with direct left ventricular puncture. Perfusion-fixed tissues from eight rats were examined morphometrically for myocyte cross-sectional area and percent collagen volume.At 6 weeks after aortic banding, left ventricular remodeling, extent of hypertrophy, and function appeared similar in male and female rats. At 20 weeks, male but not female rats showed an early transition to heart failure, with onset of cavity dilatation (left ventricular diameter=155% vs. 121% of same-sex sham), loss of concentric remodeling (relative wall thickness=102% vs. 139% of sham), elevated wall stress (systolic stress=266% vs. 154% of sham), and diastolic dysfunction (deceleration of rapid filling=251% vs. 190% of sham). Left ventricular systolic pressures were higher in female compared with male rats (186+/-20 vs. 139+/-13 mm Hg), while diastolic pressures tended to be lower (14+/-4 vs. 17+/-4 mm Hg).Gender significantly influences the evolution of the early response to pressure overload, including the transition to heart failure in rats with aortic stenosis."Heart	Outcomes	"Gender differences in 1-year survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among patients admitted with heart failure were determined.Subjects of this prospective cohort study were 435 patients admitted nonelectively between February 2, 1993 and February 2, 1994 to an urban university hospital with shortness of breath or fatigue and evidence of heart failure on admission chest radiograph. Survival was calculated among all patients, and health-related quality of life was calculated among 259 (68%) consenting participants as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 and Short Form-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scales.By 1 year, 106 (24%) patients had died, regardless of gender. Independent correlates of death were increasing Charlson Comorbidity Index score, initial serum sodium of 135 mmol/L or less, and white race. Among the 179 (90%) of 200 survivors who responded at all time points, health-related quality of life scores improved from admission but were still generally low, particularly among women. Even after adjusting for clinical and socioeconomic variables as well as baseline health-related quality-of-life scores, women still had less improvement at 1 year than men for the Physical Component Summary scale. Women rated the quality of inpatient care lower than men and also tended to rate the quality of follow-up outpatient care lower.One-year mortality was high and health-related quality of life was low in patients admitted with heart failure. Women had less improvement in physical health status and perceived their quality of care to be lower and thus may require interventions."Heart	Outcomes	"The study was designed 1) to examine the prevalence of depression in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF); 2) to explore associations between the physician's rating of functional status (NYHA class) and patient's assessment of functional status (physical limitation, dyspnea) with symptoms of depression; and 3) to explore gender related differences in relation to physician's rating and patient's rating of function status, and symptoms of depression.A sample of 119 clinically stable heart failure patients (85 males and 34 females) was recruited from an outpatient cardiology hospital practice. The patients underwent a physical examination and completed a set of questionnaires. Prevalence of depressive symptoms and the association of these symptoms with NYHA class and patient's perceived functional status was studied.Findings indicate that depressive symptoms were not predominant among this sample of CHF patients. Path analyses showed non-significant direct associations between NYHA class as well as patient's perception of dyspnea with depression. In contract, the subjective indicator of physical limitations was strongly associated with symptoms of depression among the males, but this relation was not significant among the females.Results suggest that men and women respond differently to the burden of heart failure. However, interpretation of the results from the present study should be considered as tentative and additional research is required to examine mechanisms that explain gender differences in response to heart failure."Heart	Pathophysiology	"This study investigated the effect of age and gender on central arterial hemodynamic variables derived from noninvasive tonometric carotid pressure waveforms.Women have a greater age-related increase in left ventricular (LV) mass than do men and are more likely to experience symptomatic heart failure after infarction despite their higher ejection fraction. In studies of these changes, ventricular afterload is incompletely defined by brachial blood pressure (BP) measurements. We hypothesized that there exist gender differences in pulsatile vascular load, as revealed by pressure waveform analysis, which may produce suboptimal afterload conditions in women.Data from 350 healthy normotensive subjects (187 female) aged 2 to 81 years were analyzed in decade groups. Augmentation index (AIx, the difference between early and late pressure peaks divided by pulse pressure) was used as an index of pulsatile afterload, and the ratio of diastolic to systolic pressure-time integral gave a subendocardial viability index. Heart rate, BP, ejection duration and maximal rate of pressure rise (dP/dt(max)) were also determined.Male subjects had a slightly higher systolic pressure until age 50. Female subjects had higher systolic pressure augmentation after the 1st decade, a difference that was significant after age 30 (p < 0.005 for each decade). In both males and females there was a strong age dependence for AIx (r = 0.77, p < 0.001 for females, r = 0.66, p < 0.001 for males). Although males had a larger body size and higher systolic pressure, systolic pressure-time integral was similar in males and females across all age groups. Diastolic pressure-time integral was consistently lower in females because of their shorter diastolic period. Subendocardial viability index was lower in females across the entire group. Differences in stature and heart rate may contribute to these findings.These new data may help to explain previous findings in women of an age-related increase in LV mass and excess symptomatic heart failure that are not explained by differences in brachial BP."Heart	Review	"Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) is an often fatal heart disease characterized by ventricular dilation and reduced systolic function. Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques that have enabled earlier identification of patients with IDCM, the etiology of the disease in most patients remains unknown. The current 5-year survival rate for patients with asymptomatic IDCM approaches 80%; this is a significant improvement compared with earlier reports of the natural history of IDCM. Men are more commonly afflicted with IDCM, but women with IDCM tend to present with more advanced disease. Recent analysis of 3-year transplant-free survival reveals no gender differences, however. Survival in children with IDCM is variable; 30% of infants die within 2 years of diagnosis, but 5-year survival for childhood IDCM is 60% to 84%. An association of IDCM with the peripartum period is well recognized. The etiology of peripartum cardiomyopathy remains unknown, and some cases are familial. This disease is reversible in approximately 50% of patients, and in patients with intractable congestive heart failure, cardiac transplantation is a viable treatment option. AIDS has been more recently associated with IDCM. Acute left ventricular dysfunction and consequent dilated cardiomyopathy occur with increased frequency in patients with advanced AIDS. The etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy in HIV-infected patients is presently poorly understood. Survival for patients with AIDS after development of left ventricular dysfunction is extremely poor."Heart	Management	"The overwhelming majority of cardiac transplant recipients are men. This can be partially explained by the earlier age at which heart failure develops in men. However, an underrepresentation of women also may reflect physician referral or selection biases or differences in patients' access to or acceptance of heart transplantation.We investigated whether sex bias occurred in the transplant candidate selection process at a single cardiac transplant center. We prospectively evaluated 386 individuals < 70 years of age (295 men, 91 women) referred for management of moderate to severe heart failure and/or cardiac transplant evaluation. Age, race, sex, heart failure type, New York Heart Association class, left ventricular ejection fraction, peak exercise oxygen consumption, disease duration, resting hemodynamic measurements, comorbidity index score, health insurance coverage, and estimated household income were recorded. For patients not accepted for transplantation, the reason for rejection was also obtained. Univariable and multivariable (logistic regression) analyses were performed comparing men and women and patients accepted and those not accepted for cardiac transplantation. Female sex was independently associated with rejection for cardiac transplantation (odds ratio, 2.57; P = .01). However, the reason for rejection (odds ratio, 2.57; P = .01). However, the reason for rejection was more likely to be patient self-refusal for women than for men (29% versus 9%), and female sex was independently associated with patient self-refusal (odds ratio, 4.68; P = .003). When patients who refused transplant were reclassified as accepted for transplant, female sex was no longer associated with nonacceptance. However, lower patient income was associated with nonacceptance for transplant.We found no evidence of sex bias in the selection of cardiac transplant recipients at our center. These findings suggest that the underrepresentation of women among cardiac transplant recipients may result, in part, from a sex difference in treatment preference, with a decreased willingness of women to undergo transplantation. The reasons for the difference in acceptance rates between men and women need to be elucidated."Heart	Review	"Observational and other studies suggest gender-related differences in the incidence and prognosis of heart failure. Women appear to live longer after the diagnosis of heart failure when compared with men. After myocardial infarction, women seem more likely than men to exhibit clinical heart failure. Diabetes appears to promote heart failure to a greater extent in women than in men. Review of data from clinical and epidemiologic studies suggests that men and women may differ in their myocardial adaptation to a variety of cardiac insults. Future investigation is necessary to better define gender-related differences and possible sex-specific therapies for those diseases resulting in heart failure."Heart	Outcomes	"A total of 6,273 consecutive relatively unselected patients with heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, or both (mean age 62 +/- 12 years, mean ejection fraction 31 +/- 9%), were enrolled in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) Registry over a period of 14 months. All patients were followed up for vital status and hospital admissions at 1 year. Ischemic heart disease was the underlying cause of failure or dysfunction in approximately 70% of patients, whereas hypertensive heart disease was considered to be primarily involved in only 7%. There were striking differences in the etiology of heart failure among blacks and whites: 73% of whites had an ischemic etiology of failure versus only 36% of blacks; 32% of blacks had a hypertensive condition versus only 4% of whites. The total 1-year mortality rate was 18%; 19% of patients had hospital admissions for heart failure and 27% either died or had a hospital admission for congestive heart failure during the 1st year of follow-up. Factors related to 1-year mortality or hospital admission for congestive heart failure included age, ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and female gender. There was no difference in mortality associated with congestive heart failure among blacks and whites, but hospital admissions for heart failure were more frequent in blacks. Digitalis and diuretic agents were the drugs most often used in these patients, who were often taking many medications in relation to severity of congestive heart failure symptoms and ejection fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"Heart	Outcomes	"A prospective study of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) was conducted to examine differences in hospital mortality by sex. Outcome data on 3055 CABG patients undergoing operation between 1987 and 1989 were examined for differences in patient, disease, and treatment factors.Odds ratios (OR), risk differences, and 95% confidence intervals (CI95%) were calculated. Mortality rates for women (7.1%) and men (3.3%) differed, the OR (women versus men) being 2.23 (CI95%, 1.58 to 3.15). Women were older, more often diabetic, and had more urgent or emergent surgery; adjustment yielded an OR (women versus men) of 1.75 (CI95%, 1.17 to 2.63). Body surface area (BSA) was associated with risk of death in both sexes (P = .007) and positively associated with coronary artery luminal diameters. After adjustment for BSA, sex was no longer significantly associated with mortality (OR [women versus men] of 1.18; CI95%, 0.72 to 1.95). Internal mammary artery (IMA) grafting was performed less frequently among women than men (64.8% versus 78.4%, P < .001). Smaller BSA and absence of IMA grafting were each associated with increased risk of death (RD) from heart failure. Risk of death from heart failure (RD [women minus men] = 2.05; CI95%, 0.89 to 3.22) and hemorrhage (RD [women minus men] = 0.63; CI95%, 0.13 to 1.13) was greater among women; these accounted for 71.1% of the sex-specific difference in mortality rates.Excess risk of hospital mortality among women having CABG was largely the consequence of death from heart failure and, to a lesser extent, from hemorrhage. Smaller BSA (probably because of its association with coronary artery luminal diameter) and the absence of IMA grafting were each associated with increased risk of death from heart failure."Heart	Review	"Congestive heart failure (CHF) is an important clinical syndrome. Evidence from several observational studies suggests sex-related differences in the incidence and prognosis of CHF, particularly in the setting of coronary artery disease. Women appear to be more prone than men to develop heart failure late after myocardial infarction as well as in the peri-infarction period. Additionally, diabetes mellitus appears to promote heart failure to a greater extent in women than in men."Heart	Review	"As with other cardiovascular diseases, there are sufficient data to suggest significant gender-related differences in the prevalence and presentation of congestive heart failure and myocardial diseases. From animal studies, it is apparent that there are sex-related differences in intrinsic ventricular function and in the cardiovascular response to various stimuli, which are at least partly modulated through direct effects of sex hormones on the heart. Although similar data are not available in humans, it seems likely that similar gender-related differences in cardiac function exist and may in part account for the observed differences in myocardial diseases in men and women. Additionally, genetic factors may contribute to these differences, as X-linked disorders may present differently in males and females. An awareness of the impact of sex-related factors is clearly important in the evaluation of any patient presenting with heart failure or cardiomyopathy and may alter both diagnostic and therapeutic considerations, as well as broaden our basic knowledge and understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in myocardial dysfunction."Lung	PP	"Tobacco exposure remains the main etiologic factor for lung cancer (LC). Interactions between environment and individual genetic profile are particularly important for this disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of CYP1A1*2A, CYP1A1*2C, CYP2D6*4, GSTP1, GSTM1, GSTT1 and NAT2 polymorphisms for the susceptibility to LC in a Portuguese population considering their demographic and clinical characteristics.A total of 200 LC and 247 controls subjects from the Centre of Portugal were studied. Clinical and demographic characteristics were collected from clinical files and by individual questionnaires. Polymorphisms of CYP1A1*2A, CYP1A1*2C, CYP2D6*4, GSTP1, GSTM1, GSTT1 and NAT2 were genotyped using PCR-RFLP, PCR multiplex, ARMS and real time.Gender, family history of cancer, smoke cessation and alcohol consumption were independent risk factors (p < 0.05). Associations found between phases I and II genes and LC population reveal a sex dependent distribution. Logistic regression analysis demonstrates that enhanced activation by CYPs, associated by reduced or loss of function of phase II enzymes, can lead to a greater risk. GSTP1 and NAT2 polymorphisms studied have a significant contribution for the histological tumour types and the presence of metastases, at time of diagnosis, respectively, when males with smoking habits were considered.Multiple interactions between environment and individual characteristics are clearly associated to this disease. Variants of the detoxification genes may act synergistically contributing to this disease and modifying the risk posed by smoking and sex. The GSTT1*0 and GSTP1 (Ile462Val) might contribute to the malignant phenotype through different mechanisms."Lung	OUTC	"The association between tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer is well known. However, carcinogenesis of TB and its connection with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation remains unclear. This study aimed to determine this connection to see if TB can affect the outcome of patients with lung cancer. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with lung cancer receiving EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) between 1996 and 2010 using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Because therapeutic response was required to apply EGFR-TKIs for >90 days, only patients with a follow-up of >120 days were studied and a responder was defined as intake of EGFR-TKIs >90 days. Predictors of EGFR-TKI response and survival were identified using logistic and Cox regression analyses, respectively. There were 8265 patients analyzed, including 6073 (73.5%) EGFR-TKI responder and 2192 (26.5%) nonresponder. A history of TB was found in 1.2% and 1.8% of the 2 groups, respectively. Comparing to male with pulmonary TB history, female with or without pulmonary TB history and male without pulmonary TB history all had a better EGFR-TKI response and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS). Gender and TB history were not independent prognostic factors of 2-year overall survival. The findings were similar in the subpopulation without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancies other than lung cancer, and low-income status. TB has a gender-dependent impact, with better EGFR-TKI response and 1-year PFS in female patients with lung cancer. The carcinogenesis and inflammation of TB may be different between genders."Lung	OUTC	"Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) are common pulmonary diseases associated with lung cancer. Besides, smoking is more prevalent in Taiwanese men. This study evaluated gender disparities in coexisting pulmonary diseases on survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer between 2003 and 2008 were identified from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Cases with lung adenocarcinoma were further confirmed using the Cancer Registry Database and followed up until the end of 2010. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of coexisting asthma, COPD, and/or TB to estimate all-cause mortality risk. During the study period, 13,399 cases of lung adenocarcinoma were identified. The HRs of adenocarcinoma in men and women were 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.30) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.95-1.16), respectively, for individuals with asthma, 1.32 (95% CI, 1.16-1.51) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.89-1.05), respectively, for COPD, and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.93-1.06) and 1.06 (95% CI, 0.86-1.32), respectively, for individuals with TB. Specifically, among men with coexisting pulmonary diseases, the HRs were 1.63 (95% CI, 1.25-2.13), 1.31 (95% CI, 1.08-1.59), and 1.23 (95% CI, 1.11-1.36) for individuals with asthma + COPD + TB, asthma + COPD, and COPD + TB, respectively. However, there was no increase risk of mortality among women with coexisting pulmonary diseases. Coexisting pulmonary diseases are at an elevated risk of mortality among male patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Such patients deserve greater attention while undergoing cancer treatment."Lung	OUTC	"In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of sex-based non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) varieties on survival rates.A retrospective study was performed in patients with NSCLC who were diagnosed by histological methods between the years 2000 and 2010. A chi-square test was used to compare variables. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.Of the 844 patients, 117 (13.9%) were women and 727 (86.1%) were men. Adenocarcinoma was more common in women than in men (p<0.0001). There were more women non-smokers than men (p<0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in ECOG PS, weight loss>10%, stage, LDH, albumin and treatment between women and men. Women younger than 65 years (17.0 vs 12.0 months; p=0.03), who had adenocarcinoma histology (15.0 vs 10.0 months; p=0.006) and who had a hemoglobin levelâ‰¥12 g/dL (18.0 vs 12.0 months; p=0.01) were found to have a better median OS rate than men. Median OS rates were found to be 13.0 months in females and 12.0 months in males (p=0.14). Among metastatic patients, the median OS was 11.0 months in females and 8.0 months in males (p=0.005). Among stage IIIB and stage IV patients who had first line platinum-based chemotherapy, the median OS was 17.0 months in women and 11.0 months in men (p=0.002). The response rate of chemotherapy was higher in women than in men (p=0.03).In our study, we found that survival duration is longer and chemotherapy response is better in women with NSCLC who do not have anemia or comorbidities and who are mostly non-smokers with adenocarcinomas. Further studies regarding the causes of these differences may provide clarity on this subject."Lung	CLIN	"Taste and smell alterations (TSAs) in patients with lung cancer are poorly understood. This study investigates characteristics of TSAs when most severe, reported by patients after starting treatment for lung cancer.Data was collected regarding TSAs, symptoms, food intake and nutritional status through structured interviews using the Taste and Smell Survey, the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment and 3-day food diaries. This data derives from a longitudinal project and the interview with each patient when TSAs were most severe was purposefully selected for analysis.Sixty-one of the 89 patients reported TSAs, and the TSAs group were on average younger and more frequently smokers. Thirty-one patients reported symptoms impacting negatively on food intake, with 87 % in the TSAs group and 13 % in the no-TSAs group. Most commonly reported were loss of appetite, nausea and early satiety. Gender differences were seen with more women reporting stronger sensation(s) and more men reporting weaker sensation(s) and other changes. TSAs were described as affecting enjoyment of food and eating. A trend was seen where energy intakes declined with increasing TSAs. Energy intakes in the total study population were below recommended.TSAs varied in characteristics and interacted with other symptoms. Gender differences may highlight a need to investigate approaches for identification and management of TSAs in men and women. Patients reported TSAs impacting on food enjoyment, and the hypothesis that patients with higher TSS scores have lower nutritional intakes should be followed up with a larger study in the lung cancer population."Lung	EPI	"In a prospective uncontrolled observational study we investigated the influence of gender, resilience, and marital satisfaction on mental distress of patients suffering from lung cancer and their partners. Female patients and partners report-ed impaired physical and mental health as well as lower resilience and marital satisfaction than males. Mental distress was negatively associated with resilience and marital satisfaction, both, in patients and their partners. We found a partial mediation effect of resilience and marital satisfaction on the relationship between gender and mental distress. Taking these results into account, particularly female patients and partners should preferably receive psychooncological support. "Lung	EPI	"Comparison by sex and presenting features between 2000 and 2010 of the characteristics of new cases of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Observational KBP-2010-CPHG study similar to KBP-2000-CPHG. Both studies were promoted by the French College of General Hospital Respiratory Physicians (CPHG). KBP-2010-CPHG collected data for 6083 NSCLC diagnosed between January 1st and December 31st, 2010, and followed in the respiratory departments of 119 French general hospitals.In 2010, 24.4 % of the patients were women (16 % in 2000, p<0.0001). Compared to men, women were more commonly non-smokers (34.2 vs 4.7 %) or lighter consumers (37.2 vs 43.7 pack per years) (p<0.0001). Their tumours (mostly adenocarcinoma: 64.6 vs 48.7 %, p<0.0001) were more frequently diagnosed at stage IV (62.4 vs 56.9 %, p=0.0008). EGFR mutation research was more frequently performed (48.5 vs 31.0 %, p<0.0001) and positive (20.6 vs 5.2 %, p<0.0001) in women than men. Their treatment more frequently included targeted therapy (13.4 vs 5.7 %, p<0.0001). Compared to 2000, the percentage of non-smokers increased in men (4.7 vs 2.5 %, p<0.0001) while remaining stable in women (36.1 vs 34.2 %, p=0.32). The percentage of adenocarcinomas increased, particularly in men (48.7 vs 31.5 %, p<0.0001).The percentage of women with NSCLC has increased in 10years in France. In 2010, the main gender differences persist, but have decreased with the increasing proportion of non-smokers and adenocarcinomas in men. Various hypotheses to explain these changes are discussed."Lung	REVIEW	"Lung cancer incidence is decreasing worldwide among men but rising among women due to recent changes in smoking patterns in both sexes. In Europe, the smoking epidemic has evolved different rates and times, and policy responses to it, vary substantially between countries. Differences in smoking prevalence are much more evident among European women reflecting the heterogeneity in cancer incidence rates. Other factors rather than smoking and linked to sex may increase women's susceptibility to lung cancer, such as genetic predisposition, exposure to sex hormones and molecular features, all of them linked to epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of lung cancer in women. However, biological bases of sex-specific differences are controversial and need further evaluation. This review focuses on the epidemiology and outcome concerning non-small cell lung cancer in women, with emphasis given to the Spanish population. "Lung	EPI	Lung	MANAG	"Women with lung cancer have superior long-term survival outcomes compared with men, independent of stage. The cause of this disparity is unknown. For patients undergoing lung cancer resection, these survival differences could be due, in part, to relatively better perioperative outcomes for women. This study was undertaken to determine differences in perioperative outcomes after lung cancer surgery on the basis of sex.The Society of Thoracic Surgeons' General Thoracic Database was queried for all patients undergoing resection of lung cancer between 2002 and 2010. Postoperative complications were analyzed with respect to sex. Univariable analysis was performed, followed by multivariable modeling to determine significant risk factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality.A total of 34,188 patients (16,643 men and 17,545 women) were considered. Univariable analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences in postoperative complications favoring women in all categories of postoperative complications. Women also had lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.71; PÂ <Â .001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that several preoperative conditions independently predicted 30-day mortality: male sex, increasing age, lower diffusion capacity, renal insufficiency, preoperative radiation therapy, cancer stage, extent of resection, and thoracotomy as surgical approach. Coronary artery disease was an independent predictor of mortality in women but not in men. Thoracotomy as the surgical approach and preoperative radiation therapy were predictive of mortality for men but not for women. Postoperative prolonged air leak and empyema predicted mortality in men but not in women.Women have lower postoperative morbidity and mortality after lung cancer surgery. Some risk factors are sex-specific with regard to mortality. Further study is warranted to determine the cause of these differences and to determine their effect on survival."Lung	MANAG	"This study examined race by sex differences in depression symptoms and psychosocial service use (pastors, social workers, mental health workers, support groups) among patients with lung cancer.The multiregional Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance study surveyed black and white adults with stages I to III lung cancer (n = 1,043) about depression symptoms, interest in help for mood, and psychosocial service use. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate race/sex differences in depression symptoms (modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale â‰¥ 6) and psychosocial service use, independent of demographic, clinical, psychosocial, and behavioral covariates.A total of 18.2% screened positive for depression symptoms. This proportion was highest among black men (24.7%), followed by white women (20.6%), black women (15.8%), and white men (15.0%). In adjusted analyses, white women showed greater risk for depression symptoms relative to black women (P = .01) and white men (P = .002), with no other differences among groups. Black patients were less likely than white patients to receive desired help for mood from their doctors (P = .02), regardless of sex. Among all patients, black women were most likely to have contact with pastoral care and social work.Race and sex interacted to predict risk of depression symptoms. Covariates accounted for elevated risk among black men. White women showed greater risk than black women and white men, independent of covariates. Black patients may experience greater barriers to receiving help for mood from their doctors. Race by sex differences in contact with psychosocial services highlight potential differences in the extent to which services are available, acceptable, and/or sought by patients."Lung	OUTC	"Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the European Union (EU) and deaths from lung cancer have been projected to escalate to epidemic proportions amongst females over the next years. We examined lung cancer mortality rates in men and women from Andalusia (Spain) over a 37-year period [1975-2012].Longitudinal epidemiological study analyzing lung cancer mortality trends in males and females. Data on lung cancer mortality in Andalusia for the period 1975-2012 were obtained from the official cause-of-death publications of the Institute of Statistics of Andalusia. For each sex, age-standardized (European standard population) mortality rates (ASR) from lung cancer were calculated for all ages and truncated at 30-64, 65-74, and >75 years using the direct method. Standardized rate trends by age and sex were estimated by joinpoint regression analysis.In men, the ASR steadily increased through the period 1993-1995, reaching a peak of 145.72 deaths/100,000 people. Subsequently, lung cancer deaths decreased to a rate of 125.47 in the 2011-2012 period. A moderate increase was seen in women until the late 1990s and early 2000s. Thereafter, a very notable rise was observed in females for all age groups, the only exception being older subjects. The sex differences decreased from 8.6:1 in the 1975-1977 period to 6.8:1 in the 2011-2012 period.Lung cancer mortality rates decreased significantly in Andalusian men from 1975 to 2012. More importantly, we demonstrate for the first time the beginning of the lung cancer epidemics in Andalusian women as previously predicted for this area."Lung	EPI	"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Singapore. We examine trends of lung cancer from 1968 to 2007, explore ethnic and gender-specific incidence rates, and examine period and cohort effects in Chinese and Malays using Age-Period-Cohort (APC) analysis.Aggregated data for cancer incidences and estimated person-years for the period 1968-2007 were obtained from the Singapore Cancer Registry. An APC analysis was performed using a Poisson regression model.Lung cancer incidence rates were more than two times higher in males compared to females, and also higher in Chinese compared to Malays and Indians. While rates in Chinese men, and, to a lesser extent, Chinese women, had been declining since the early 1980s, rates in Malay men continued to increase. The full APC model described the cancer trend in Chinese males, Chinese females and Malay males, while an age-drift model described the cancer trend in Malay females. Among Chinese males, Chinese females and Malay males, there was no clear pattern to the period curvature effects, although similar cohort curvatures were seen, with positive curvature effects in older cohorts that declined towards zero and negative effects in younger cohorts.There are strong gender and ethnic differences in lung cancer incidence in Singapore. Differences in smoking rates and differential ethnic effects of smoking may explain some but not all of these differences. The similar cohort curvatures suggest that environmental factors in Singapore occurring in the past but no longer present at similar intensity or frequency may explain the positive deviation from a linear trend. Apart from smoking, other environmental factors such as changes in diet, improved sanitation and ventilation, and declines in infectious diseases like tuberculosis may play a role."Lung	PP	"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1 and M1 are detoxification enzymes which neutralize various carcinogenic compounds. Polymorphisms of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes which encode the enzymes could be associated with cancer risk.We investigated the association of GSTT1 and GSTM1 null polymorphisms with lung cancer risk in a tightly matched, considerably large sample in China. Genotyping was performed utilizing polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis and DNA sequencing, and associations were measured by using logistic regression analysis.We found that the null genotypes of both polymorphisms resulted in an increased lung cancer risk, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-2.00) for GSTT1 and OR 1.87 (95% CI 1.46-2.39) for GSTM1 (p < 0.01). Significant associations remained after stratification by histopathology (p < 0.01) and smoking status (p < 0.05). When gender-stratified association was performed, we found that the GSTT1 null genotype resulted in an increased risk among males (adjusted OR 2.95, 95% CI 2.07-4.20; p < 0.01) but not females (p > 0.05), while the GSTM1 null genotype resulted in an increased risk among females (adjusted OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.54-3.10; p < 0.01) but not males (p < 0.05).Polymorphisms in GSTT1 and GSTM1 are associated with the risk of lung cancer in a gender-specific manner."Lung	OUTC	"To explore whether there are gender differences in the number of GP recorded cases, the probability of survival and consulting pattern prior to diagnosis amongst patients with three non-sex-specific cancers.Cross sectional study.UK primary care.12,189 patients aged 16 years or over diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC), 11,081 patients with lung cancer and 4,352 patients with malignant melanoma, with first record of cancer diagnosis during 1997-2006.Cancer cases recorded in primary care; probability of survival following diagnosis; and number of GP contacts within the 24 months preceding diagnosis.From 1997-2006, overall rates of GP recorded CRC and lung cancer cases recorded were higher in men than in women, but rates of malignant melanoma were higher in women than in men. Gender differences in survival were small; 49% of men and 53% of women survived at least 5 years following CRC diagnosis; 9% of men and 12% of women with lung cancer, and 77% of men and 86% of women with malignant melanoma. The adjusted male to female relative hazard ratio of death in all patients was 1.20 (95%CI 1.13-1.30), 1.24 (95%CI 1.16-1.33) and 1.73 (95%CI 1.51-2.00) for CRC, lung cancer and malignant melanoma respectively. However, gender differences in the relative risk were much smaller amongst those who died during follow-up. For each cancer, there was little evidence of gender difference in the percentage who consulted and the number of GP contacts made within 24 months prior to diagnosis.This study found that patterns of consulting prior to cancer diagnosis differed little between two genders, providing no support for the hypothesis that gender differences in survival are explained by gender differences in consultation for more serious illness, and suggests the need for a more critical view of gender and consultation."Lung	EPI	"Providing lifetime smoking prevalence data and gender-specific cigarette consumption data for use in epidemiological studies of tobacco-induced cancer in Norway. Characterising smoking patterns in birth cohorts is essential for evaluating the impact of tobacco control interventions and predicting smoking-related mortality.Norway.Previously analysed annual surveys of smoking habits from 1954 to 1992, and individual lifetime smoking histories collected in 1965 from a sample of people born in 1893-1927, were supplemented with new annual surveys of smoking habits from 1993 to 2013. Age range 15-74â€…years.Current smoking proportions in 5-year gender-and-birth cohorts of people born between 1890 and 1994.The proportion of smokers increased in male cohorts until the 1950s, when the highest proportion of male smokers (76-78%) was observed among those born in 1915-1934. Among women, the peak (52%) occurred 20â€…years later, in women born in 1940-1949. After 1970 smoking has declined in all cohorts of men and women. In the 1890-1894 cohorts, male smoking prevalence was several times higher than female, but the gap declined until no gender difference was present among those born after 1950. Gender-specific per capita consumption was even more skewed, and men have consumed over 70% of all cigarettes since 1930. The incidence of lung cancer for men peaked at around 2000, with the highest incidence rate estimated at ca. 38%. The incidence of lung cancer for women is still increasing, and estimated incidence rate for 2011 was 25.2%.In an epidemiological perspective, men have had a longer and more intense exposure to cigarettes than women. The gender-specific incidence of lung cancer reflects the gender difference in consumption over time."Lung	EPI	"Polymorphisms in nucleotide and base excision repair genes are associated with the variability in the risk of developing lung cancer. In the present study, we investigated the polymorphisms of following selected DNA repair genes: XPC (Lys939Gln), XPD (Lys751Gln), hOGG1 (Ser326Cys) and XRCC1 (Arg399Gln), and the risks they present towards the development of lung cancer with the emphasis to gender differences within the Slovak population. We analyzed 761 individuals comprising 382 patients with diagnosed lung cancer and 379 healthy controls. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism method. We found out statistically significant increased risk for lung cancer development between genders. Female carrying XPC Gln/Gln, XPC Lys/Gln+Gln/Gln and XRCC1 Arg/Gln, XRCC1 Arg/Gln+Gln/Gln genotypes had significantly increased risk of lung cancer corresponding to ORÂ =Â 2.06; pÂ =Â 0.04, ORÂ =Â 1.66; pÂ =Â 0.04 and ORÂ =Â 1.62; pÂ =Â 0.04, ORÂ =Â 1.69; pÂ =Â 0.02 respectively. In total, significantly increased risk of developing lung cancer was found in the following combinations of genotypes: XPD Lys/Gln+XPC Lys/Lys (ORÂ =Â 1.62; pÂ =Â 0.04), XRCC1 Gln/Gln+hOGG1 Ser/Ser (ORÂ =Â 2.14; pÂ =Â 0.02). After stratification for genders, the following combinations of genotype were found to be significant in male: XPD Lys/Gln+XPC Lys/Lys (ORÂ =Â 1.87; pÂ =Â 0.03), XRCC1 Arg/Gln+XPC Lys/Lys (ORÂ =Â 4.52; pÂ =Â 0.0007), XRCC1 Arg/Gln+XPC Lys/Gln (ORÂ =Â 5.44; pÂ <Â 0.0001). In female, different combinations of the following genotypes were found to be significant: XRCC1 Arg/Gln+hOGG1 Ser/Ser (ORÂ =Â 1.98; pÂ =Â 0.04), XRCC1 Gln/Gln+hOGG1 Ser/Ser (ORÂ =Â 3.75; pÂ =Â 0.02), XRCC1 Arg/Gln+XPC Lys/Gln (ORÂ =Â 2.40; pÂ =Â 0.04), XRCC1 Arg/Gln+XPC Gln/Gln (ORÂ =Â 3.03; pÂ =Â 0.04). We found out decreased cancer risk in genotype combinations between female patients and healthy controls: XPD Lys/Lys+XPC Lys/Gln (ORÂ =Â 0.45; pÂ =Â 0.02), XPD Lys/Gln+XPC Lys/Lys (ORÂ =Â 0.32; pÂ =Â 0.005), XPD Lys/Gln+XPC Lys/Gln (ORÂ =Â 0.48; pÂ =Â 0.02). Our results did not show any difference between pooled smokers and non-smokers in observed gene polymorphisms in the association to the lung cancer risk. However, gender stratification indicated the possible effect of heterozygous constitution of hOGG1 gene (Ser/Cys) on lung cancer risk in female non-smokers (ORÂ =Â 0.20; pÂ =Â 0.01) and heterozygous constitution of XPC gene (Lys/Gln) in male smokers (ORÂ =Â 2.70; pÂ =Â 0.01). "Lung	REVIEW	"In the last 20 years, there has been an increased focus on gender differences in health and disease. The earliest studies of lung cancer enrolled mainly men, as the incidence of lung cancer among women was exceedingly low. As social patterns changed around World War II and women began to smoke more, the epidemiology of lung cancer has changed. The higher percentage of lung cancer in nonsmoking women as compared with nonsmoking men suggests that lung cancer behaves differently in women. Studies of lung cancer in women indicate that there are differences in risk factors, histology, pathophysiology, treatment outcomes, and prognosis as compared with men. The purpose of this review is to provide a concise summary of the literature on lung cancer as it pertains to women, with an emphasis on new areas of research and treatment options. "Lung	CLIN	"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Sex differences in lung cancer incidence and survival are known. Female sex is an independent good prognostic factor. Estrogens appear to play a key role in lung cancer outcomes. Accordingly, antiestrogen use may also influence survival in female non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In this study, we compared survival among antiestrogen users and nonusers. We performed a retrospective population-based study. Using the Manitoba Cancer Registry (MCR), we identified all women diagnosed with NSCLC from 2000 to 2007. The population-based Drug Program Information Network was accessed to establish which patients received antiestrogens. Demographic data (e.g., smoking patterns, stage, histology) were gathered from the MCR and by chart review. Survival differences between antiestrogen-exposed and not exposed groups were compared using multivariable Cox regression. Two thousand three hundred twenty women fit our patient criteria, of which 156 had received antiestrogens. Exposure to antiestrogens was associated with a significantly decreased mortality in those exposed both before and after the diagnosis of NSCLC (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.42, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0006). This association remained consistent across age and stage groups. Antiestrogen use before and after the diagnosis of NSCLC is associated with decreased mortality. This supports previous evidence that estrogens may play a key role in the biology and outcomes of NSCLC and suggests a potential therapeutic use for these agents in this disease."Lung	REVIEW	"Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer in women. In the last decade, the first measurable decline in disease-related mortality has occurred and in the last 5 years, the first decline in lung cancer incidence in women in the United States has been reported. Five-year survival rates are much higher in early-stage disease, making effective screening a priority. Data on screening with low-dose computed tomography are controversial; existing guidelines are not sex specific and recommend testing only for patients at high risk for the disease. Although cigarette smoking remains the predisposing factor that is most often associated with tumor development, the advent of molecularly targeted therapy and the growing evidence that susceptible targets are more prevalent in never-smoking women have brought more attention to this particular subpopulation. Studies of both surgery and systemic therapy suggest that not only never-smoking women but also women overall experience better outcomes than men. Identifying all of the factors contributing to these sex differences presents us with an opportunity to identify potentially a distinct tumor biology in women who would warrant a distinct personalized treatment approach. "Lung	OUTC	"To determine whether patient sex has a significant effect on long-term outcomes post curative resection of non-small-cell lung cancer.We retrospectively analysed a prospectively validated thoracic surgery database (n = 4212), from a single institution, from September 2001 to October 2012. Univariate, Cox multivariate and propensity analysis was performed. Long-term follow-up was carried out via the National Strategic Tracing Service that operates in the United Kingdom.One hundred per cent follow-up was achieved. Overall institutional in-hospital mortality was 2.0% for all thoracic resections. Median survival was 2.78 years (range 0-13 years). Two thousand two hundred and thirty-three males and 1979 females were included. Kaplan-Meier survival of all the patients demonstrated superior survival of females for all stages, P = 0.0003, and stage I, P = 0.0006. Female sex conferred no survival advantage in stage II, P = 0.7, and IIIa, P = 0.1. Sub-analysis by histological type demonstrated that females had superior survival with adenocarcinoma compared with males, P < 0.001, but no sex difference existed with squamous carcinomas, P = 0.2. Cox analyses demonstrated that female sex was an advantageous prognostic factor for the entire study group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.96] and Stage I only (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.63). Sex was of no significance in Stage II and IIIa disease with regard to survival. Sub-analysis demonstrated that female sex was not a significant factor determining survival in patients with squamous carcinoma; however, it was significantly associated with increased survival in patients with adenocarcinoma (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.78). A 1:1 propensity analysis confirmed the above findings.Propensity matching and Cox multivariate regression analysis confirmed the univariate finding that female sex is only associated with improved survival in patients with Stage I adenocarcinoma. Patient sex does not affect survival of patients with squamous carcinoma."Lung	CLIN	"More and more differences in lung cancer are being detected between men and women. Lung cancer, at the beginning of the last century a rare disease in women, has a growing incidence in women, in particular in young females. Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women in developed countries with different histological types and adenocarcinomas are more frequent in women than in men. Cigarette smoking is the most prevalent cause of lung cancer in women, in addition susceptibility to carcinogens may differ between the sexes. As more non-smoking women than men develop lung cancer, it is likely that they are exposed to excessive environmental carcinogens such as second-hand-smoking, in-house-radon or cooking fumes. Furthermore, genetic and hormonal influences play a role in lung cancer etiology for women. Taken together, women have a better overall survival than men with lung cancer. Differences in molecular susceptibility patterns are observed between men and women, and show that molecular targets such as EGFR or ALK more frequent in women."Lung	REVIEW	"Tobacco smoking is a main cause of disease in Switzerland; lung cancer being the most common cancer mortality in men and the second most common in women. Although disease-specific mortality is decreasing in men, it is steadily increasing in women. The four language regions in this country might play a role in this context as they are influenced in different ways by the cultural and social behaviour of neighbouring countries. Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal, negative binomial models were fitted on subgroup-specific death rates indirectly standardized by national references to explore age- and gender-specific spatio-temporal patterns of mortality due to lung cancer and other tobacco-related cancers in Switzerland for the time period 1969-2002. Differences influenced by linguistic region and life in rural or urban areas were also accounted for. Male lung cancer mortality was found to be rather homogeneous in space, whereas women were confirmed to be more affected in urban regions. Compared to the German-speaking part, female mortality was higher in the French-speaking part of the country, a result contradicting other reports of similar comparisons between France and Germany. The spatio-temporal patterns of mortality were similar for lung cancer and other tobacco-related cancers. The estimated mortality maps can support the planning in health care services and evaluation of a national tobacco control programme. Better understanding of spatial and temporal variation of cancer of the lung and other tobacco-related cancers may help in allocating resources for more effective screening, diagnosis and therapy. The methodology can be applied to similar studies in other settings."Lung	Clinical	"Although tobacco exposure is the predominant risk factor for lung cancer, other environmental agents are established lung carcinogens. Measuring the genotoxic effect of environmental exposures remains equivocal, as increases in morbidity and mortality may be attributed to coexposures such as smoking.We evaluated genetic instability and risk of lung cancer associated with exposure to environmental agents (e.g., exhaust) and smoking among 500 lung cancer cases and 500 controls using the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) assay. Linear regression was applied to estimate the adjusted means of the CBMN endpoints (micronuclei and nucleoplasmic bridges). Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate lung cancer risk and to control for potential confounding by age, gender, and smoking.Cases showed significantly higher levels of micronuclei and nucleoplasmic bridges as compared with controls (mean Â± SEM = 3.54 Â± 0.04 vs. 1.81 Â± 0.04 and mean Â± SEM = 4.26 Â± 0.03 vs. 0.99 Â± 0.03, respectively; P < 0.001) with no differences among participants with or without reported environmental exposure. No differences were observed when stratified by smoking or environmental exposure among cases or controls. A difference in lung cancer risk was observed between nonexposed male and female heavy smokers, although it was not statistically significant (I(2) = 64.9%; P value for Q statistic = 0.09).Our study confirms that the CBMN assay is an accurate predictor of lung cancer and supports the premise that heavy smoking may have an effect on DNA repair capacity and in turn modulate the risk of lung cancer.Identifying factors that increase lung cancer risk may lead to more effective prevention measures."Lung	Epidemiology	"Chrysotile asbestos has continued to be mined and used in China, but its health effects on exposed workers have not been well documented. This study was conducted to give a complete picture about cause-specific mortality in Chinese asbestos workers. A cohort of 586 males and 279 females from a chrysotile textile factory were prospectively followed for 37 years. Their vital status was identified, and the date and underlying cause of death were verified from death registry. Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios by gender were computed with nationwide gender- and cause-specific mortality rates as reference. Male workers were 11 years older, and had 6 years longer exposure duration than females; 79% in males and 1% in females smoked. In males, the mortality rate of all cancers doubled; both larynx and lung cancer were four-fold, and mesothelioma was 33-fold. In females, there was slightly excess mortality from lung cancer and all cancers, and significant increase in mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. Other significantly increased mortality was seen from cancers of thymus, small intestine and penis in males, and cancers of bone and bladder in females. In addition to asbestosis, mortality from pulmonary heart disease was significantly elevated in both genders. The data confirmed significantly excess mortality from mesothelioma in either gender, lung and larynx cancers in males, and ovarian cancer in females. A gender difference in mortality from lung cancer and all cancers could be mainly due to the discrepancies in age, exposure duration and smoking between the male and female workers."Lung	REVIEW	"Lung cancer is a major health problem for both men and women, not only because of the high incidence rate but, more alarming, the high mortality rate. The prevalence of lung cancer in women has been increasing worldwide. In the United States, lung cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer death in women, and this may well be the case in European countries in just a few years. The most important risk factors for the development of lung cancer in both men and women is cigarette smoking. Smoking among women has increased significantly since the 1960s, and, unfortunately, the risk of death from cigarette smoking continues to increase among women. Although epidemiological data remain controversial regarding the increased risk of lung cancer from tobacco exposure in women, there is little controversy surrounding the fact that the biology of lung cancer differs between the sexes. This paper summarizes the explanations for the sex differences in lung cancer, including differences in molecular abnormalities, growth factor receptors, hormonal influences, cytochrome P-450 enzymes, and DNA repair capacity, as well as differences in the histology of lung cancer and treatment outcomes in women. "Lung	CLIN	"Worldwide lung cancer incidence is decreasing or leveling off among men, but rising among women. Sex differences in associations of tobacco carcinogens with lung cancer risk have been hypothesized, but the epidemiologic evidence is conflicting. We tested sex-smoking interaction in association with lung cancer risk within a population-based case-control study, the Environment and Genetics in Lung Cancer Etiology (EAGLE) Study (Lombardy, Italy, 2002-2005). Detailed lifetime smoking histories were collected by personal interview in 2,100 cases with incident lung cancer and 2,120 controls. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for pack-years of cigarette smoking were estimated by logistic regression, adjusted for age, residence area, and time since quitting smoking. To assess sex-smoking interaction, we compared the slopes of odds ratios for logarithm of pack-years in a model for men and women combined. Overall, the slope for pack-years was steeper in men (odds ratio for female-smoking interaction = 0.39, 95% confidence interval: 0.24, 0.62; P < 0.0001); after restriction to ever smokers, the difference in slopes was much smaller (odds ratio for interaction = 0.63, 95% confidence interval: 0.29, 1.37; P = 0.24). Similar results were found by histological type. Results were unchanged when additional confounders were evaluated (e.g., tobacco type, inhalation depth, FagerstrÃ¶m-assessed nicotine dependence). These findings do not support a higher female susceptibility to tobacco-related lung cancer."Lung	EPI	"Additive risk models are necessary for understanding the joint effects of exposures on individual and population disease risk. Yet technical challenges have limited the consideration of additive risk models in case-control studies.Using a flexible risk regression model that allows additive and multiplicative components to estimate absolute risks and risk differences, we report a new analysis of data from the population-based case-control Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology study, conducted in Northern Italy between 2002-2005. The analysis provides estimates of the gender-specific absolute risk (cumulative risk) for non-smoking- and smoking-associated lung cancer, adjusted for demographic, occupational, and smoking history variables.In the multiple-variable lexpit regression, the adjusted 3-year absolute risk of lung cancer in never smokers was 4.6 per 100,000 persons higher in women than men. However, the absolute increase in 3-year risk of lung cancer for every 10 additional pack-years smoked was less for women than men, 13.6 versus 52.9 per 100,000 persons.In a Northern Italian population, the absolute risk of lung cancer among never smokers is higher in women than men but among smokers is lower in women than men. Lexpit regression is a novel approach to additive-multiplicative risk modeling that can contribute to clearer interpretation of population-based case-control studies."Lung	EPI	"Avoidable mortality (AM), or ""unnecessary untimely death,"" is considered an indicator of health care quality. We investigated trends in the age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) and associated standard expected years of life lost (SEYLL) for deaths amenable to medical care or public health measures in Taiwan from 1971-2008, with an emphasis on identifying areas where additional medical or public health investment may help reduce the burden of AM.Taiwan's ASMRs per 100,000 for AM and other causes of death were calculated using data from the National Death Certificate Registry in five-year bins from 1971 to 2008. SEYLL rates per 100,000 were calculated annually from 1971 to 2008 using the same data source.ASMR for almost all AM and other causes of death declined dramatically from 1971 to 2008 except for lung cancer (16.6% and 7.4% increase among men and women, respectively) and breast cancer (109.8% increase among women). In the same period, SEYLL due to lung cancer increased from 269.2 to 555.7 for men and 249.7 to 342.5 for women. For women, SEYLL due to breast cancer increased from 263.5 in 1971 to 659.3 in 2008. There were gender-specific differences in the reduction (or increase) in AM rates, with women showing larger rates of reduction or smaller rates of increase. Among men, AM fell by 65.9% from 1971-1975 to 2006-2008, and deaths from other causes increased by 15.6%. Among women, AM and deaths from other causes fell by 80.8% and 59.8% respectively. SEYLL decreased, respectively among males and females, from 23,147.3 and 24,081.1 in 1971 to 11,261.8 and 5,929.6 in 2008.From 1971 to 2008, Taiwan experienced a dramatic reduction in most AM and corresponding SEYLL except for lung cancer (for both males and females) and breast cancer (for females). Additional effort should be devoted to public health measures to combat the rising prevalence of smoking in Taiwan, which may be responsible for the increasing AM from lung cancer. If AM in breast cancer continues unabated in the future, greater policy emphasis on the early detection and treatment of breast cancer may also be warranted."Lung	Outcomes	"Survival in the case of lung cancer patients not only remains poor and decreases with advancing age at diagnosis, but recent European studies also report that it differs by sex. Our study sought to describe sex-related differences in lung cancer survival in Spain, and evaluate the role played by histologic type. Our analysis covered seven Spanish regions with population-based cancer registries. Cases diagnosed with lung cancer during the period 1995-1999 were followed up until December 31, 2004. To ascertain possible sex differences we performed multiple regression analysis. Age-standardized 5-year relative survival proved significantly higher in women (11.8%) than in men (9.2%), and among the youngest patients relative survival at 5 years conditional on surviving 1 year, was 1.74 times significantly higher in women than in men. The regression analysis showed that men had a higher relative excess risk of dying (RER) than did women (1.1 [95% CI 1.03-1.18]), with this being particularly marked among the 15-54 age group (1.42 [1.24-1.64]). Analysis by histologic type showed that in small cell carcinoma, men had a higher RER than women (1.29 [1.02-1.61]); in squamous cell carcinoma, men had a significantly lower RER than women during the first and fifth years; and in large cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, the RER displayed no significant sex-related differences. Lung cancer survival rates in Spain are poor, with better prognosis in women, especially among patients aged under 55 years at diagnosis, or those with small cell carcinoma."Lung	Outcomes	"Death rates from lung cancer in men are higher in Andalusia than in other Spanish regions. This study describes lung cancer mortality rates and their trends in Andalusia from 1975 through 2008. Data on lung cancer mortality were obtained from the Death Registry of Andalusia. For each gender, age group-specific and standardized (overall and truncated) rates were calculated by the direct method using the world standard population. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify points where a significant change in trends occurred. In men, short-term trends for age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) declined significantly from 2004 through 2008 for each age group < 80 years old. In women, the segmented joinpoint analysis showed a decrease from 1975 through 1998 in ASMRs (overall) (-0.6%, P < 0.05), followed by a marked increase (4.6%, P < 0.05). A decrease in male versus female mortality due to lung cancer is evident in Andalusia (Spain)."Lung	Pathophysiology	"The potential gender differences in lung cancer development have been proposed on the basis of hormonal actions. We aimed to evaluate whether estrogen receptors (ERs) in non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) patients may primarily depend upon intratumoral estrogen produced via aromatase pathway.We evaluated ER beta (ERÎ²) and aromatase status in 169 Japanese NSCLC patients through immunohistochemistry analysis (IHC). Significance of IHC was further confirmed in NSCLC cell lines via in vitro assays.IHC analysis of NSCLC patients demonstrated that both ERÎ² and aromatase were highly co-expressed (p=0.032) in carcinoma cells. Overall survival in males was significantly worse than that in postmenopausal female among double positive NSCLC patients (p=0.010) but not in non-double positive patients. In addition, among double positive cases, overall survival of males was significantly worse than that of postmenopausal females in those with higher ERÎ² Allred score â‰¥5, (p=0.034), but not in those with lower ERÎ² Allred score=3-4. In-vitro analysis demonstrated aromatase activity on testosterone treatment, which resulted in in situ estrogen production (p<0.0001) and increased proliferation of ERÎ² overexpressing A549 cells (p<0.0001). Aromatase inhibitor i.e. letrozole abrogated this proliferation and also enhanced the androgenic activity (p<0.0001). Testosterone treatment resulted in estrogen responsive elements activation (p<0.0001) in ERÎ² vector transfected A549 and LK87 cells whereas ER blocker i.e. fulvestrant abrogated this effect, (p<0.0001).Our results suggest that co-expression of ERÎ² and aromatase in NSCLCs of Japanese males may result in tumor progression and potential endocrine therapy may confer therapeutic benefits to these patients."Lung	Clinical	"There are variable observations in published literature regarding smoking status and stage of lung cancer (LC) with positive, negative and no associations being reported. In particular, data regarding the association of quantified smoking status (QSS) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage at the time of diagnosis is limited. In India, bidi - the hand rolled form of tobacco wrapped in the dried tendu leaf - is the most common smoking product. The current study was conducted to assess stage differences, if any, based upon QSS, among newly diagnosed LC patients.A systematic review of English literature was performed for previous publications that had assessed NSCLC stage differences in relation to QSS. Collected data on demographic and disease characteristics of 654 LC patients presenting to the authors' institute was also analyzed. Smoking index (SI) was used for QSS and was defined as number of bidis and cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by years smoked. Patients were categorized as never-smokers [Group I, n=151]; light/moderate smokers (SI=1-300) [Group II, n=202] and heavy smokers (SI â‰¥301) [Group III, n=301]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (LRA) was performed to derive adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Among the 520 NSCLC patients, mean [standard deviation (SD)] age in groups I, II and III was 54.5 (12.5), 58.6 (9.9) and 61.2 (9.4) years respectively (P<0.001). Percentage of males in the three groups was 48.1%, 88.0%, and 97.9% (P<0.001). Age and gender differences between groups I, II and III were also significant among 134 small cell lung cancer patients with mean (SD) ages of 44.0 (10.6), 55.7 (10.3) and 58.9 (9.3) years (P<0.001) and percentage of males being 50.0%, 90.4% and 95.5% respectively (P<0.001). Among NSCLC patients, distribution in groups I, II and III respectively of squamous (28.1%, 50.0% and 57.9%) and non-squamous histologies (59.3%, 37.3% and 27.2%) differed significantly (P<0.001). Stage distribution observed for NSCLC patients in groups I, II and III respectively was as follows: stages I-IIIA (8.1%, 19.3 and 18.7%), stage IIIB (24.4%, 34.7% and 42.1%) and stage IV (67.4%, 46.0% and 39.1%). The difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). Differences remained significant (P<0.001) for presence of extrathoracic disease [ETD] (41.5%, 28.0% and 16.6%). On multivariate LRA, SI â‰¥301 was the only variable that was independently associated with both advanced stage (IIIB-IV) [OR=0.25 (95% CI=0.11-0.61)] and ETD [OR=0.29 (95% CI=0.16-0.53)] at presentation.Among newly diagnosed NSCLC patients in North India, significant differences exist, based upon SI, for disease stage. Heavy smoking was independently associated with lower odds of having advanced stage as well as with lower odds of having ETD at the time of diagnosis. This observation of the current study however requires confirmation by larger prospective studies."Lung	Review	"Women live much longer than men in Korea, with remarkable gains in life expectancy at birth for the past decades. The gender differential has steadily increased over time, reaching a peak of more than 8 years in 1980s, and decreased thereafter to 6.7 years in 2005. Studies to investigate the pattern and contributing factors to changes in the life expectancy gender gap have been mostly from Western countries, and there has been no such study in Asian countries, except in Japan. We therefore aimed to examine age- and cause-specific contributions to the changing gender differentials in life expectancy in Korea, in particular the decline of the gap, using a decomposition method. Between 1970 and 1979 when the gender gap in life expectancy widened, faster mortality decline among women in ages 20-44 explained 66% of the total increase in the gender gap, which would be due to substantial improvements in reproductive health among women and excess male mortality in occupational injuries and transport accidents. Although greater survival advantage among elderly women over 70 contributed to further increase in the gender gap, the contributions from younger ages with the ages 15-64 contributing the most (-2 years) resulted in the overall reduction of the gender gap which began in 1992 and continued to 2005. Among causes of death, liver diseases (-0.5 years, 38% of the total decline), transport accidents (-0.4 years, 31%), hypertensive diseases (-0.3 years, 19%), stroke (-0.1 years, 11%), and tuberculosis (-0.1 years) contributed the most to the overall 1.4 years reduction in the gender gap. However, changes in mortality from lung cancer (+0.3 years), suicide (+0.3 years), chronic lower respiratory diseases (+0.2 years), and ischemic heart diseases (+0.1 years) contributed to widening the gap during the same period. In sum, while smoking-related causes of death have contributed most to the narrowing gap in most other industrialized countries, these causes contributed toward increasing the gender gap in Korea. Instead, liver disease, hypertension-related diseases, and transport accidents were major contributing causes of death to the narrowing of gender differentials in life expectancy in Korea."Lung	Clinical	"The present study was undertaken to test circulating autoantibody to ATP-binding cassette C3 (ABCC3) transporter in order to confirm whether anti-ABCC3 antibody could serve as a biomarker for early diagnosis of lung cancer.This study recruited 275 patients (178 males and 97 females) with non-small cell lung cancer (either squamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma) and 226 control subjects (134 males and 92 females) well matched in age and smoking history. Anti-ABCC3 IgA and IgG were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approach that was developed in house with the human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II) restricted antigens.Mann-Whitney U test showed that the IgG antibody level was significantly higher in female patients with adenocarcinoma than female controls (Z = -4.34, P < 0.001) and that the IgA antibody level was significantly higher in male patients with squamous carcinoma than male controls (Z = -3.12, P = 0.002). Pearson's Chi-square (Ï‡(2)) test showed that female patients with adenocarcinoma had a significantly higher positive rate for IgG autoantibody than female controls (Ï‡ ( 2 ) = 8.73, P = 0.003). The ELISA sensitivity against a specificity of >95 % was 18.1 % for IgG assay in female patients and 18.0 % for IgA assay in male patients. The inter-assay deviation was 10.6 % for IgG assay and 14.5 % for IgA assay.Circulating autoantibodies to ABCC3 transporter may be a potential biomarker that can be added to a panel of existing biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer although the gender differences should be taken into account."Lung	Clinical	"The identification of robust prognostic factors for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is clinically important. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer has identified both sex and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of (18)F-FDG in the primary tumor as measured by PET as potential prognostic variables. We examined the prognostic value of SUVmax in a surgical cohort of patients with NSCLC and disaggregated the findings by sex.Patients who had undergone a preoperative PET/CT scan and surgical resection with curative intent from 2001 to 2009 were identified from a prospective database. An SUVmax cutoff was calculated using receiver-operating-characteristic curves. Overall survival was correlated with SUVmax for the whole cohort and disaggregated by sex.Inclusion criteria were met by 189 patients: 127 (67%) men and 62 (33%) women. Five-year survival was 54.6% for the whole cohort, 47.7% for men, and 68.2% for women. SUVmax correlated negatively with survival in a univariate analysis for the whole cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54-4.09; P < 0.001) and men (HR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.94-6.05; P < 0.001) but not for women (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.43-3.12; P = 0.77), using 8 as a cutoff. In multivariate analysis, SUVmax correlated with overall survival for the whole cohort (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.05-2.99; P = 0.05) and men (HR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.32-4.37; P = 0.004) but not for women (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.15-4.47; P = 0.80).SUVmax independently predicted overall survival for men but not for women in this surgical cohort. Our results suggest that SUVmax is an independent prognostic variable in men with surgically treated early NSCLC."Lung	Management	"It is currently not known whether most lung cancers detected by computerized tomography (CT) screening are aggressive and likely to be fatal if left untreated, or if a sizable fraction are indolent and unlikely to cause death during the natural lifetime of the individual. We developed a longitudinal biologically-based model of the relationship between individual smoking histories and the probability for lung cancer incidence, CT screen detection, lung cancer mortality, and other-cause mortality. The longitudinal model relates these different outcomes to an underlying lung cancer disease pathway and an effective other-cause mortality pathway, which are both influenced by the individual smoking history. The longitudinal analysis provides additional information over that available if these outcomes were analyzed separately, including testing if the number of CT detected and histologically-confirmed lung cancers is consistent with the expected number of lung cancers ""in the pipeline"". We assume indolent nodules undergo Gompertz growth and are detectable by CT, but do not grow large enough to contribute significantly to symptom-based lung cancer incidence or mortality. Likelihood-based model calibration was done jointly to data from 6878 heavy smokers without asbestos exposure in the control (placebo) arm of the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET); and to 3,642 heavy smokers with comparable smoking histories in the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study (PLuSS), a single-arm prospective trial of low-dose spiral CT screening for diagnosis of lung cancer. Model calibration was checked using data from two other single-arm prospective CT screening trials, the New York University Lung Cancer Biomarker Center (NYU) (n=1,021), and Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt) cohorts (n=677). In the PLuSS cohort, we estimate that at the end of year 2, after the baseline and first annual CT exam, that 33.0 (26.9, 36.9)% of diagnosed lung cancers among females and 7.0 (4.9,11.7)% among males were overdiagnosed due to being indolent cancers. At the end of the PLuSS study, with maximum follow-up of 5.8 years, we estimate that due to early detection by CT and limited follow-up, an additional 2.2 (2.0,2.4)% of all diagnosed cancers among females and 7.1 (6.7,8.0)% among males would not have been diagnosed in the absence of CT screening. We also find a higher apparent cure rate for lung cancer among CARET females than males, consistent with the larger indolent fraction of CT detected and histologically confirmed lung cancers among PLuSS females. This suggests that there are significant gender differences in the aggressiveness of lung cancer. Females may have an inherently higher proportion of indolent lung cancers than males, or aggressive lung cancers may be brought into check by the immune system more frequently among females than males."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world, favored by smoking. Nonsmall cell lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease whose prevalence is increasing among women. Epidemiological, hormonal and pathological factors explain tumor differences between men and women. Women have more frequently adenocarcinomas, EGFR mutations and respond better to cancer treatments. In recent decades, many advances have been made, allowing us to move from histological to molecular characterization of lung tumors. Further analysis of gender disparities will help us to understand and improve the management of patients with NSCLC."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Based on epidemiological, clinical, and preclinical data, lung carcinogenesis can be distinctive in women, suggesting that women should be treated differently depending on the expression of various specific biomarkers. We aimed to describe the hormonal and genetic profile of lung cancer in both men and women to identify gender specificities. Primary lung-tumor tissues from surgically treated patients, (50 men, 50 women) were analyzed and compared for expression of estrogen receptors (ER) Î± and Î², progesterone receptors (PR), epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR), and HER2 (for EGFR and K-Ras mutations). These data were combined with clinical and outcome data. Fewer women with lung cancer were smokers (p=0.001) and they smoked fewer cigarettes (p=0.001). We observed a higher rate of EGFR mutations (p=0.02) and ERÎ± expression (p=0.006) in women. ERÎ² and EGFR were also expressed more frequently in women (p=0.29 and p=0.16). HER2 was overexpressed regardless of gender in three men and two women. K-Ras was mutated in 16% of both men and women. Interestingly, there was a positive link between EGFR expression and expression of ERÎ± (p=0.028) and ERÎ² (p=0.047) in both men and women. Expression of ERÎ± was associated with improved disease-free survival (p=0.007). Our findings provide further evidence on the specificities of lung cancer in women. The differential expression of specific biomarkers, which could be targeted by therapy, favors the development of gender-based treatment guided by biomarker expression."Lung	Pathophysiology	"In non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) there are gender differences. The female gender is associated with more adenocarcinomas (ADCA), among both smokers and non-smokers compared to men. Women with NSCLC have a better prognosis compared to men, regardless of other factors. A possible role for oestrogen receptor (ER) signalling has been proposed. The role for ERÎ² in NSCLC is still not clear, especially concerning the impact of smoking. In a material of NSCLC (n = 262), ERÎ² and cyclins A1 and A2 were studied by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In 137 of those cases, frozen material was available, on which expression analysis of ESR2 (ERÎ²) and cyclin A1 were performed. Data were correlated to histology, gender, smoking habits, stage and clinical outcome. ERÎ² was expressed in 86% of the cases. ERÎ² was most frequently expressed in Stage I ADCAs, especially in male subjects. A correlation between ERÎ² expression and cyclins was observed in ADCA, also with a male predominance. ERÎ² transcripts had a positive prognostic impact in ADCA. ERÎ² transcripts were increased in NSCLC among smokers compared to non-smokers. In conclusion, our data support a role for ERÎ² in lung ADCAs, proposing a role for ERÎ² in lungcarcinogenesis, especially among smokers."Lung	Pathophysiology	"To characterize the clinicopathologic features of ALK-rearranged lung cancer, and suggest a molecular test protocol for lung adenocarcinoma in the small biopsy specimen.In 735 NSCLC surgical specimens, clinicopathologic features, ALK protein over-expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and ALK rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as well as EGFR and KRAS mutation studies were analyzed.Of the 735 NSCLC cases, 28 (3.8%) were ALK FISH-positive. ALK rearrangement, EGFR and KRAS mutation were mutually exclusive. ALK rearrangement was significantly higher in adenocarcinomas (6.8%, p<0.001), younger age (p<0.0007), women (7.6%, p<0.001), and never-smokers (8.9%, p<0.001) with no gender difference in the adenocarcinoma or never-smoker subgroup. ALK FISH-positivity was not associated with disease recurrence (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.42-1.49) or overall survival (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.24-1.55). However, ALK-rearranged lung cancer tended to show more frequent lymph node metastasis despite its lower T stage. Similar to EGFR-mutated lung cancer, ALK-rearranged lung cancer was enriched in adenocarcinoma, women, and never-smokers. The results of ALK IHC and FISH obtained from tissue microarray (TMA)/biopsy specimens and whole sections after resection were concordant.ALK rearrangement was not a significant prognostic factor in surgically resectable NSCLC. The clinical profiles of ALK-rearranged lung cancer patients overlapped with those of EGFR-mutated patients. Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous tests for ALK IHC and EGFR mutation (Chung's SNUBH molecular test protocol), which has important implications for the storage and use of small biopsy or cytology samples for genetic analysis."Lung	Epidemiology	"Based on hospital discharges in 1001-2010, we calculated risk of tumours with an elevated occupational and environmental etiological fraction by health district of residence within the Local Health Unit (LHU) N. 8 of Sardinia. With reference to the age and gender-specific hospitalization rates of the whole LHU, residents in the urban Cagliari health district showed an excess risk of haemolymphopoietic cancer (RR = 1.07; 95% CI 1.03-1.12) and bladder cancer (RR = 1.10; 95% CI 1.05-1.16); in both instances, risks were higher among female residents. The highest excess risk for lung cancer was observed among residents in the Quartu-Parteolla health district (RR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.05-1.21), and it was slightly higher among male residents. The results appear to confirm the role of urban factors in increasing cancer risk."Lung	Epidemiology	"To examine the role of gender, age at immigration and length of stay on incidence trends of common cancers, we studied risk of colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancers in immigrants to Sweden from 1958 to 2008. The nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database was used to calculate standardized incidence ratios for common cancers among immigrants compared to Swedes. Immigrants were classified into ""high-risk"" countries when their risk was increased, into ""low-risk"" when their risk was decreased and into ""other"" when their risk was nonsignificant. Among those who immigrated at younger age (<30 years), we found an increasing trend for colorectal cancer risk in low-risk men and high-risk women. Among those who immigrated at older age (â‰¥ 30 years), a decreasing lung cancer risk in high-risk men and an increasing breast cancer risk in low-risk women were observed. The increasing trend of prostate cancer risk was independent of age at immigration. The risk trends for ""other"" immigrants were between the risks of low- and high-risk countries. The gender-specific shifts in cancer risks in immigrants toward the risk in natives indicate a major role of sex, age at immigration and environmental exposures in colorectal and lung cancers risks. In contrast, the unchanged trend of breast cancer among those who immigrated at younger ages and an increasing trend for those who migrated at older ages may suggest a limited effect for environmental exposures, especially at younger age. Our study points out a role of age at immigration on the risk trend of cancer."Lung	Clinical	"Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of deaths caused by cancer worldwide. A diagnostic test for LC is needed for monitoring high-risk populations.Fifty-seven markers were measured using multiplex immunoassays of plasma of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); (245 men, 114 women, 1 unknown), asthma (67 men, 111 women, 2 unknown) and of healthy controls (165 men, 122 women, 1 unknown). Mass spectrometry was used for biomarker discovery. A support vector machine (SVM) was used for data analysis.When all biomarkers and both genders were co-analyzed, SVM classified NSCLC and asthma with an accuracy of 0.94. Restricting to NSCLC versus healthy using best subsets of variables (males: epidermal growth factor (EGF), interleukin-8 (IL-8), soluble Fas (sFas), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1); females: EGF, soluble cluster of differentiation 40 (sCD40) ligand, IL-8) yielded sensitivity and specificity of 1. Expression of eleven mass spectrometric biomarkers differed between pathologies.Significant inter-pathology and gender differences between biomarkers may improve diagnosis of LC."Lung	Review	"Sex differences in the biology of different organ systems and the influence of sex hormones in modulating health and disease are increasingly relevant in clinical and research areas. Although work has focused on sex differences and sex hormones in cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neuronal systems, there is now increasing clinical evidence for sex differences in incidence, morbidity, and mortality of lung diseases including allergic diseases (such as asthma), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, as well as pulmonary hypertension. Whether such differences are inherent and/or whether sex steroids play a role in modulating these differences is currently under investigation. The purpose of this review is to define sex differences in lung structure/function under normal and specific disease states, with exploration of whether and how sex hormone signaling mechanisms may explain these clinical observations. Focusing on adult age groups, the review addresses the following: 1) inherent sex differences in lung anatomy and physiology; 2) the importance of certain time points in life such as puberty, pregnancy, menopause, and aging; 3) expression and signaling of sex steroid receptors under normal vs. disease states; 4) potential interplay between different sex steroids; 5) the question of whether sex steroids are beneficial or detrimental to the lung; and 6) the potential use of sex steroid signaling as biomarkers and therapeutic avenues in lung diseases. The importance of focusing on sex differences and sex steroids in the lung lies in the increasing incidence of lung diseases in women and the need to address lung diseases across the life span."Lung	Clinical	"There are no effective clinical biomarkers for early and specific detection of lung cancer (LC). The changes in the levels of some serum metabolites of LC patients are associated with patient gender and LC stages.Serum metabolites of the LC patients (n=58) and healthy controls (n=495) were performed using direct-infusion positive ion electrospray ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in combination with univariate and partial least squares discriminant analyses (PLS-DA).Univariate analysis indicated that 141 of the 212 serum metabolites were significantly changed in the LC patients compared with healthy controls. PLS-DA model, based on the 141 metabolites, demonstrated the differential metabolite distribution in single-sex LC patients compared with the corresponding healthy controls, and also in LC females compared with LC males. Several lipids comprising fatty acid derivations, sphingomyelin (SM) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) were associated with the LC progression. Classification using oleamide, long chain acyl carnitines, LPC(18:1), LPC(20:4), LPC(20:3), LPC(22:6), and SM(16:0/1) as a biomarker panel resulted in remarkable separation between the LC patients and healthy controls with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 91%, respectively.The serum metabolites found in this study may play essential roles in gender-specific LC detection and early diagnosis of cancer."Lung	Management	"Severe hematological toxicity has been frequently observed during amrubicin monotherapy for patients with lung cancer despite the favorable anti-tumor response. The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify pretreatment factors associated with severe hematological toxicity.The medical records of lung cancer patients treated with amrubicin monotherapy were reviewed, and univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted.From January 2003 to December 2006, the medical records of 103 patients were extracted. Grade 4 neutropenia was frequently observed in females (male, 66% and female, 90%, P = 0.036 in a univariate analysis). In a multivariate analysis, female gender (P = 0.019), body weight loss (P = 0.021) and amrubicin dose (P = 0.028) were significantly correlated with Grade 4 neutropenia.Gender could be considered as one of the important predictive factors associated with Grade 4 neutropenia in patients receiving amrubicin monotherapy."Lung	Epidemiology	"The incidence of urogenital tumours is constantly increasing as a result of over-proportional ageing of the population in industrialized nations. Follow-up of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) primarily relies on the detection of either relapse or progression and does not include screening for second malignancies. This study investigated the incidence of independent non-urothelial second malignancies and associated risk factors in patients with NMIBC.The charts of 380 consecutive patients (297 men and 83 women) with newly diagnosed NMIBC over a 16-year period at a Swiss hospital were analysed retrospectively. Age, stage of bladder tumour, smoking status, and occurrence of second and third malignancies were registered. Observed incidences of independent non-urothelial malignancies were compared with age- and gender-specific rates based on data from the National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs).Mean age at first NMIBC diagnosis was 69.9 years. Histological stage of the NMIBC was pTa in 241 patients (63.4%), pT1 in 102 (26.8%)and pTis in 37 (9.7%). During follow-up, 62 independent non-urothelial second or third malignancies were observed in 48 men (16.2%) and 10 women (12.0%). In male patients, prostate and lung cancer (SIR 4.3 and 5.7, respectively) were more frequent than expected in the general population, as were lung and uterine cancer in women.Follow-up in patients with NMIBC should pay special attention to independent non-urothelial malignancies. Investigations for non-urological malignant disease, especially for lung cancer, should form part of the standard follow-up in NMIBC patients."Lung	Review	"Historically, lung cancer has been viewed as a male disease, but during the past 50 years there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of lung cancer in women. Lung cancer is currently the most common cause of cancer death in American women, accounting for more than one quarter of all cancer deaths. This has been attributed to a significant increase in tobacco consumption by women; however, approximately 1 in 5 women with lung cancer never smoked. As the incidence of lung cancer in women has increased, significant gender-based differences in epidemiology, biology, and treatment responses have become evident and warrant further investigation to advance the treatment of lung cancer in all patients."Lung	Clinical	"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma immunoreactivity for parathyroid hormone-related protein has been associated with increased survival in female patients but not in male patients. The current investigation attempted to substantiate this finding in 2 new patient groups.Patients were divided into groups with and without immunoreactivity for a carboxyl-terminal parathyroid hormone-related protein epitope assessed in deparaffinized sections by a blinded observer. One group included 85 female patients with stage I lung cancer, and the second group had 48 female and 66 male patients with stage I-IV lung cancer. Survival times were compared by the log-rank test between groups separated by tumor parathyroid hormone-related protein status.Parathyroid hormone-related protein was present in 70%-80% of the patients, independent of sex, stage, and smoking history. In the females with stage I lung cancer, parathyroid hormone-related protein increased median survival from 25 to 60 months (P < .05). In the second group, parathyroid hormone-related protein expression increased 48-month disease-free survival of female lung cancer patients from 44% to 63% (P < .05), but had no effect in male patients. Parathyroid hormone-related protein remained a significant, independent predictor when evaluated together with other covariates by Cox multivariate regression.This study verifies that parathyroid hormone-related protein is a sex-dependent survival factor for non-small-cell lung carcinoma, that it correlates with disease-free survival, and that the association with survival holds for women with early-stage disease as well as more advanced cancer. Thus, the protein could find use as a prognostic indicator and could be a target for therapy."Lung	Review	"Results of epidemiological studies suggest that, after one controls for the number of cigarettes smoked, women have a three times higher risk of getting lung cancer than men. Although the mechanism(s) explaining this gender-dependent difference in lung cancer risk is not known, it is thought that endocrine factors may play an important role. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells contain estrogen receptors and synthesize 17Î²-estradiol (E(2)) and estrone (E(1)), which can undergo further metabolism into the catechol estrogens, 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE(2)) and 4-hydroxyestrone (4-OHE(1)), respectively. Catechol estrogens are formed from E(2) by the actions of cytochrome p450 1B1 (CYP1B1). CYP1B1 is present in normal human bronchial epithelial) cells, and its activity is increased by cigarette smoking. Both 4-OHE(1) and 4-OHE(2) are mutagenic and carcinogenic and may exert their biological effects by inducing DNA adducts in cancer-related genes, including the tumor suppressor gene p53 and the proto-oncogene K-ras. Women with lung cancer have a different p53 mutational spectrum and a higher frequency of K-ras mutations than do men with lung cancer. Both clinical and basic research studies support the hypothesis that E(2) and cigarette smoking are cofactors in lung carcinogenesis in women. More specifically, cigarette smoke stimulates metabolism of E(2) into the genotoxic metabolites, 4-OHE(1) and 4-OHE(2,) which interact with DNA in cancer-related genes, including the tumor suppressor gene, p53, and the proto-oncogene K-ras, two genes frequently mutated in patients with lung cancer. E(2) may stimulate cellular proliferation and enhance tumor growth."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Recent epidemiological studies have disputed whether females are at increased risk of lung cancer compared to males. However, several molecular studies are in support of an increased susceptibility to tobacco smoke carcinogens among females. Our earlier findings suggest that women display higher levels of smoking-induced bulky/hydrophobic DNA adducts which may be related to an increased expression of CYP1A1 in their lungs, compared to men. In this in vitro study, 11 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, 6 of male and 5 of female origin, were exposed to benzo[a]pyrene, cigarette smoke condensate (CSC), or vehicle control. Subsequent expression analysis of genes in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bioactivation pathway was conducted with Real-Time RT-PCR. DNA adducts were measured in benzo[a]pyrene-exposed cells by Â³Â²P-postlabelling analysis, and CYP1 activity was measured by EROD assay. Analysis of benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adducts showed higher levels of adducts in cell lines from women compared to cell lines from men (p=0.03). The results also revealed significant sex differences in CYP1A1 gene expression, both in untreated cells (p=0.03), and in cells exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (p=0.017) and cigarette smoke condensate (p=0.0043). In CSC-exposed cells, significantly higher levels of CYP1 activity was found in cell lines of female origin (p=0.049). These results are in support of the previously published in vivo data, providing evidence for a higher susceptibility to PAH of women's lungs."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in both women and men worldwide but gender differences exist in their clinical and biological manifestations. In particular, among life time non-smoker, female are far more likely to develop lung carcinoma than male. Recent studies demonstrated that estrogens are synthesized in situ in both male and female lung cancers through aromatase, suggesting that sex steroid may contribute to the pathogenesis and development of lung carcinoma. In addition, human lung carcinomas have been recently demonstrated to be frequently associated with expression of estrogen receptors in both male and female patients and a lower expression of aromatase was reported to be associated with better prognosis. Preclinical studies further demonstrated that aromatase inhibitor (AI) suppressed the lung tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. These findings all suggest a potential role of intratumoral aromatase in biological behavior of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of human lung malignancy. Therefore, AIs may become viable therapeutic options for disease management in NSCLC patients but further studies are definitely required to obtain a better understanding of the potential roles of intratumoral aromatase expression as a predictive biomarker for clinical outcome in these NSCLC patients."Lung	Outcomes	"It has been proposed that the chemokine receptor, CXCR4, and its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), play a critical role in organ-specific tumor metastasis. High CXCR4 expression in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors is associated with poorer outcome; however, its effect on patient outcome in advanced NSCLC has not been explored.After institutional ethical approval was obtained, demographic details, clinical variables, and outcome data were collected on consecutive NSCLC patients diagnosed at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre from 2003 to 2006 (Glans-Look Lung Cancer Database). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded diagnostic biopsies from stage IV patients were obtained and tissue microarrays generated. CXCR4 expression within NSCLC cells was analyzed by quantitative fluorescent immunohistochemistry using the HistoRx PM-2000 platform and then correlated with clinical outcome.Of 832 patients, 170 had samples suitable for tissue microarray generation and analysis. Automated immunohistochemistry for CXCR4 was successfully completed on all 170 patients. High expressors had a significantly poorer median overall survival of 2.7 months versus 5.6 months for the low expressors (p = 0.0468). This difference is driven by high-expressing females who have a median overall survival of 1.6 months versus 6.4 months for the low expressors (p = 0.006).CXCR4 is expressed in the majority of NSCLC tumors, and overexpression is associated with significantly poorer survival in stage IV NSCLC patients. Interestingly, this poor outcome is disproportionately represented in the female population. Our results suggest a gender-dependent difference in clinical outcome based on CXCR4 overexpression in stage IV NSCLC."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer has been viewed as the most common malignant cancer with high incidence, mortality and poor survival all over the world. A lot of investigations indicated there are significant gender-associated differences in lung cancer in several characteristics such as epidemiology, pathology, clinical outcome and prognosis. The insight into these differences may help to clarify the gender-associated characteristics of lung cancer, and to drawn out new approach for treatment and prevent of lung cancer depending on gender-associated characteristics. Furthermore, study on mechanism of gender-associated characteristics may even help to illuminate the pathogenesis of lung cancer."Lung	Management	"Cancer survivorship following cancer treatment is uncertain as physical and psychological sequelae related to the disease or its treatment may persist. However, little is known about the experience of symptoms after treatment.The purposes of this study were to (1) examine postchemotherapy (post-CTX) symptom trajectories in cancer survivors and (2) determine whether demographic characteristics predicted symptom trajectories.One hundred patients who recently completed CTX for lung cancer, colorectal cancer, or lymphoma rated symptoms on an electronic patient care monitor system prior to ambulatory care visits. Latent growth curve analyses were conducted to examine the trajectories of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, distress, and depression for 16 months after initial CTX.Symptoms were present at the first follow-up visit following CTX (P < .0001) and persisted over 16 months. The depression trajectory was predicted by sex: males showed a convex curvilinear growth trajectory, whereas females showed a concave trajectory (P < .05). Higher distress was predicted by younger age (P < .05).Psychological and physical symptoms persisted over the 16-month period following CTX for the entire sample. Sex differences in coping could partially explain the different trajectories of growth for depression, but further studies are warranted. Younger patients may be more vulnerable for distress during this posttreatment phase.The posttreatment surveillance plan for cancer survivors should include a comprehensive assessment of psychological and physical symptoms. Persistence of symptoms can be expected in some patients, and supportive interventions should be tailored according to symptom reports."Lung	Clinical	"Steroid hormones and growth factors affect lung cancer, and it is possible they act in concert to influence patient outcome.Primary lung tumors and normal lung tissue were analyzed for expression and localization of estrogen receptor Î± and Î²-1 (ERÎ± and ERÎ²), aromatase, progesterone receptor (PR), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).Tumors expressed higher levels of ERÎ² compared to matched normal lung, whereas the reverse was true of PR. High cytoplasmic ERÎ² expression was identified as an independent negative prognostic predictor of overall survival (OS; HR = 1.67), and low total PR was identified as an independent negative predictor of time to progression (TTP; HR = 1.59). After adjusting for stage, age, sex, and smoking, combined high cytoplasmic ERÎ² and low total PR showed enhanced effects on OS (HR = 2.64) and on TTP (HR = 6.02). Further effects on OS were observed when EGFR expression was included (HR = 5.32). Patients with low cytoplasmic ERÎ², low aromatase, low EGFR, and high total PR had shorter OS than patients with the opposite pattern (HR = 6.60). Contribution of these markers to survival showed no significant sex differences in a multivariable model. ERÎ± was elevated in tumors but was not predictive of survival, and appears to represent a variant ERÎ± protein that is only recognized by a C-terminal antibody.Hormonal and EGFR pathways together may contribute to lung cancer prognosis. Lung tumors with high ERÎ²-1/low PR may define patients with aggressive biology. A validation study is necessary to fully assess the predictive value of these markers."Lung	Management	"E4599 compared carboplatin and paclitaxel with (PCB) or without (PC) bevacizumab in patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Bevacizumab improved overall survival. However, an unplanned subset analysis did not show a survival benefit for females treated with bevacizumab.Known prognostic factors and toxicities were compared by sex. Proportional hazards models of survival with multiple factor combinations were used to adjust for treatment effect.The analysis includes 850 patients. The median survival was 8.7 months (PC) versus 11.7 months (PCB) for males (p = 0.001) and 13.1 months (PC) versus 13.3 months (PCB) for females (p = 0.87). Progression-free survival and response rate on the PCB arm were 6.3 months and 29% for males and 6.2 months and 41% for females (p > 0.05). Progression-free survival and response rate on the PC arm were 4.3 months and 16% for males and 5.3 months and 14% for females (p > 0.05). No significant demographic differences were seen between the two arms for males, whereas fewer females on the PCB arm had liver metastasis (PCB 11.7% versus PC 23.2%, p = 0.003). Adverse events with a sex difference on the PCB arm included severe hypertension (males: 4.2%, females: 9.9%, p = 0.02), constipation (males: 1.4%, females: 4.7%, p = 0.05), and abdominal pain (males: 0.9%, females: 5.2%, p = 0.01). In the proportional hazards model adjusting for the other factors, the test for a sex by treatment interaction was not significant (p = 0.09).Multiple factors may contribute to the apparent sex-specific differences in efficacy of bevacizumab noted in this study."Lung	Epidemiology	"To determine whether female smokers are more or less susceptible to the detrimental pulmonary-function effects of smoking when compared to male smokers among patients with lung cancer.Pack-years and pulmonary function indices were compared between 1,594 men and women with lung cancer who were smokers or had a history of smoking. Differences in individual susceptibility to smoking were estimated using a susceptibility index formula.Of the patients, 959 (92.8%) men and 74 (7.2%) women were current smokers. Common histological types of lung cancer were squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma, among others. Women had a lower number of pack-years, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1), liters), forced vital capacity (FVC, liters), and total lung capacity (TLC, liters) compared to those of men (25.0 Â± 19.2 vs. 42.9 Â± 21.7 for pack-years; 1.4 Â± 0.5 vs. 2.0 Â± 0.6 for FEV(1); 3.0 Â± 0.7 vs. 2.0 Â± 0.6 for FVC; 4.5 Â± 0.8 vs. 5.7 Â± 1.0 for TLC; all p < 0.001). The susceptibility index for women was significantly higher compared to that of men (1.1 Â± 4.1 vs. 0.7 Â± 1.1; p = 0.001). A significant inverse association was shown between the susceptibility index and TLC and FVC (r = -0.200 for TLC, -0.273 for FVC; all p < 0.001).The results suggest that the detrimental effects of smoking on pulmonary function are greater in women, as compared to those in men, among patients with lung cancer."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Genetic variants located at 15q25, including those in the cholinergic receptor nicotinic cluster (CHRNA5) have been implicated in both lung cancer risk and nicotine dependence in recent genome-wide association studies. Among these variants, a 22-bp insertion/deletion, rs3841324 showed the strongest association with CHRNA5 mRNA expression levels. However the influence of rs3841324 on lung cancer risk has not been studied in depth.We have, therefore, evaluated the association of rs3841324 genotypes with lung cancer risk in a case-control study of 624 Caucasian subjects with lung cancer and 766 age- and sex-matched cancer-free Caucasian controls. We also evaluated the joint effects of rs3841324 with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs16969968 and rs8034191 in the 15q25 region that have been consistently implicated in lung cancer risk.We found that the homozygous genotype with both short alleles (SS) of rs3841324 was associated with a decreased lung cancer risk in female ever smokers relative to the homozygous wild-type (LL) and heterozygous (LS) genotypes combined in a recessive model [OR(adjusted) = 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31-0.89, P = 0.0168]. There was no evidence for a sex difference in the association between this variant and cigarettes smoked per day (CPD). Diplotype analysis of rs3841324 with either rs16969968 or rs8034191 showed that these polymorphisms influenced the lung cancer risk independently.This study has shown a sex difference in the association between the 15q25 variant rs3841324 and lung cancers. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these observations."Lung	Clinical	"The increasing incidence of lung cancer in women and their supposed survival advantage over men requires clarification of the significance of sex. Age, stage, histologic features, differentiation grade, and Ki-67 index were assessed in 405 surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) using a standardized tissue microarray platform. Women were associated with well/moderate tumor differentiation, a Ki-67 index of 3% or less, and adenocarcinoma histologic features. Female sex predicted increased survival time only by univariate analysis. Stratified by sex, increased survival was noted for women older than 64 years, with a tumor at postsurgical International Union Against Cancer stage I, with adenocarcinoma histologic features, with well- or moderately differentiated tumors, or with a Ki-67 index of 3% or less. Sex is not an independent prognostic parameter for patients with surgically resected NSCLC. Sex-linked differences are associated with other factors, thus simulating a prognostic impact of sex. This study elucidates sex-specific interactions between patient and tumor characteristics, which are pivotal toward improving prognostic accuracy, individualized therapies, and screening efforts."Lung	Pathophysiology	"A recent epidemiological study demonstrated a reduced risk of lung cancer mortality in breast cancer patients using antiestrogens. These and other data implicate a role for estrogens in lung cancer, particularly nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 61% of human NSCLC tumors express nuclear estrogen receptor Î² (ERÎ²); however, the role of ERÎ² and estrogens in NSCLC is likely to be multifactorial. Here we tested the hypothesis that proteins interacting with ERÎ² in human lung adenocarcinoma cells that respond proliferatively to estradiol (E2) are distinct from those in non-E2-responsive cells.FLAG affinity purification of FLAG-ERÎ²-interacting proteins was used to isolate ERÎ²-interacting proteins in whole cell extracts from E2 proliferative H1793 and non-E2-proliferative A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Following trypsin digestion, proteins were identified using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Proteomic data were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Select results were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation.LC-MS/MS identified 27 non-redundant ERÎ²-interacting proteins. ERÎ²-interacting proteins included hsp70, hsp60, vimentin, histones and calmodulin. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the ERÎ²-interacting proteins revealed differences in molecular and functional networks between H1793 and A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in these and other lung adenocarcinoma cells confirmed that ERÎ² and EGFR interact in a gender-dependent manner and in response to E2 or EGF. BRCA1 interacted with ERÎ² in A549 cell lines and in human lung adenocarcinoma tumors, but not normal lung tissue.Our results identify specific differences in ERÎ²-interacting proteins in lung adenocarcinoma cells corresponding to ligand-dependent differences in estrogenic responses."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Although cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for lung cancer, only 7% of female lung cancer patients in Taiwan have a history of smoking. The genetic mechanisms of carcinogenesis in nonsmokers are unclear, but semaphorins have been suggested to play a role as lung tumor suppressors. This report is a comprehensive analysis of the molecular signature of nonsmoking female lung cancer patients in Taiwan, with a particular focus on the semaphorin gene family.Sixty pairs of tumor and adjacent normal lung tissue specimens were analyzed by using Affymetrix U133plus2.0 expression arrays. Differentially expressed genes in tumor tissues were identified by a paired t test and validated by reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Functional analysis was conducted by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis as well as gene set enrichment analysis and sigPathway algorithms. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to evaluate the association of SEMA5A expression and clinical outcome.We identified 687 differentially expressed genes in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Many of these genes, most notably the semaphorin family, were participants in the axon guidance signaling pathway. The downregulation of SEMA5A in tumor tissue, both at the transcriptional and translational levels, was associated with poor survival among nonsmoking women with NSCLC.In summary, several semaphorin gene family members were identified as potential therapeutic targets, and SEMA5A may be useful as a prognostic biomarker for NSCLC, which may also be gender specific in Taiwanese patients.A novel biomarker for NSCLC is identified."Lung	Outcomes	"Women with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are more likely to have better survival than men. This study intended to assess gender differences in the survival of these patients in a large registry population.In 2005, the Japanese Joint Committee for Lung Cancer Registration performed a nationwide retrospective registry study regarding the prognosis and clinicopathologic profiles of patients who underwent resection for primary lung neoplasms in 1999. The registry data of 12,509 patients with NSCLC were analyzed in terms of gender differences in prognosis and clinicopathologic features.There were 8353 (66.8%) men and 4156 (33.2%) women with a mean age at operation of 66.4 and 65.0 years, respectively (p < 0.001). Women had a higher incidence of adenocarcinoma (p < 0.001) and stage IA disease (p < 0.001) than men. The overall survival was significantly better in women than men. The 5-year survival rates (5-YSRs) for women and men were 75.6 and 57.9%, respectively (p = 0.0000). According to histology, the overall survival of women was significantly better than that of men for both adenocarcinoma (5-YSR, 77.7 versus 61.9%, p = 0.0000) and nonadenocarcinoma (5-YSR, 59.3 versus 53.1%, p = 0.035). In adenocarcinoma, women had a significantly better prognosis than men for pathologic stage I/II disease. However, in nonadenocarcinoma, there was no significant prognostic difference between the two genders in pathologic stage I/II disease.Women with NSCLC, especially with an adenocarcinoma histology, had better survival than men. Women were more likely to have adenocarcinoma and stage IA disease, which might account for the better prognosis in women."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer is a dominant cause of cancer mortality. The etiology of lung cancer is mainly related to cigarette smoking, airborne genotoxic carcinogens, and arsenic, but its sex-specific incidence suggests that other mechanisms, such as hormones, may also be involved in the process of carcinogenesis. A number of agents commonly present in the living environment can have dual biological effects: not only are they genotoxic / carcinogenic, but they are also hormonally active as xenoestrogens. This dualism may explain sex-specific differences reported in both types and incidence of lung cancer. In a novel approach to investigate the complexity of lung cancer, etiology, including systems biology, will be used as a tool for a simultaneous interpretation of measurable environmental and biological parameters. Using this approach, the etiology of human lung cancer can be more thoroughly investigated using the available data from oncology and environmental health. The information gained could be applied in the introduction of preventive measures, in personalized medicine, and in more relevant legislation, which should be adjusted to reflect the current knowledge on the complex environmental interactions underlying this life-threatening disease."Lung	Review	"Several epidemiologic and molecular epidemiologic studies have indicated that, for a given number of cigarettes smoked, women may be at higher risk of lung cancer compared with men.The objective of this article was to address sex differences in lung cancer susceptibility, with special emphasis on genetic, biological, and sex-related hormonal factors.Using the search terms gender or sex difference in combination with lung cancer, susceptibility, survival, polymorphism, biomarker, and smoking, we conducted a review of the available literature in the MEDLINE, Current Contents, and Web of Science biomedical databases. Relevant English-language publications (January 1966-December 2009) on sex differences in lung cancer were identified.Higher levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon DNA adducts were observed in female lung cancer patients compared with their male counterparts, even though the level of tobacco carcinogens was lower among women than among men. DNA repair capacity was found to be lower in female lung cancer patients than in their male counterparts. A higher frequency of G-to-T transversion mutations in the tumor suppressor protein p53 gene has been observed in women compared with men. Non-small cell lung tumors in women appeared to be more likely than those in men to harbor K-ras, c-erbB-2, or epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. Sex differences have been identified in the expression of the cytochrome P4501A1 gene and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor gene, with women exhibiting higher gene expression than men for both of these genes. Evidence supporting a possible association between estrogen and lung cancer risk based on epidemiologic studies has not been consistent, but sex hormones may influence susceptibility to lung carcinogenesis.Women may be more susceptible to tobacco smoke and potentially more vulnerable to lung cancer development. If additional studies yield supporting evidence, researchers, the public, and policy makers should focus on ways to reduce the risk of lung cancer for women."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Cell cycle checkpoints play critical roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity and inactivation of checkpoint genes are frequently perturbed in most cancers. In a case-control study of 299 non-small cell lung cancer cases and 550 controls in Baltimore, we investigated the association between gamma-radiation-induced G(2)/M arrest in cultured blood lymphocytes and lung cancer risk, and examined genotype-phenotype correlations between genetic polymorphisms of 20 genes involving in DNA repair and cell cycle control and gamma-radiation-induced G(2)/M arrest. The study was specifically designed to examine race and gender differences in risk factors. Our data indicated that a less efficient DNA damage-induced G(2)/M checkpoint was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in African American women with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.63 (95% CI = 1.01-7.26); there were no statistically significant associations for Caucasians, or African American men. When the African American women were categorized into quartiles, a significant reverse trend of decreased G(2)/M checkpoint function and increased lung cancer risk was present, with lowest-vs.-highest quartile OR of 13.72 (95% CI = 2.30-81.92, p(trend) < 0.01). Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis indicated that polymorphisms in ATM, CDC25C, CDKN1A, BRCA2, ERCC6, TP53, and TP53BP1 genes were significantly associated with the gamma-radiation-induced G(2)/M arrest phenotype. This study provides evidence that a less efficient G(2)/M checkpoint is significantly associated with lung cancer risk in African American women. The data also suggested that the function of G(2)/M checkpoint is modulated by genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle control."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Lung cancer frequently develops multiple organ metastases, which thus makes this disease a leading cause of malignancy-related death worldwide. A gender difference is reported to affect the incidence and mortality of lung cancer; however, whether and how the gender difference is involved in lung cancer metastasis is unclear. This study evaluated the gender difference in multiple organ metastases in human small cell lung cancer (SBC-5) cells by using natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient mice. Among multiple organ metastases, only bone metastasis formation significantly increased in female mice in comparison to males, while no significant difference was observed in the metastases to the liver and lungs. The suppression of androgen by castration or androgen receptor antagonist treatment in male mice also induced a significant increase of bone metastases. The number of osteoclasts in the bone metastatic lesions was greater in female mice and in mice with androgen suppression than in control male. However, there was no significant difference in the serum concentration of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) associated with gender or androgen suppression. An in vitro study also indicated that sex steroid treatment had no effect on the proliferation or PTHrP production in SBC-5 cells. These results indicate that the balance of sex steroids therefore plays an important role in the formation of bone metastasis in small cell lung cancer, and suggests diverse mechanisms of interaction between cancer cells and host cells in the bone microenvironment."Lung	Epidemiology	"Smoking is a major contributor to all-cause mortality in Europe and accounts for one-fifth of the cancer-related deaths. Monitoring the tobacco epidemic via an analysis of lung cancer trends is essential in helping countries arrest the effects of tobacco epidemic in the region. The study aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the temporal patterns of lung cancer mortality in Europe, emphasizing country- and sex-specific differences. National lung cancer mortality data were extracted from the WHO mortality databank by age, sex, year of death (1970-2007) for 36 countries in Europe. Trends in lung cancer mortality in men have tended to decrease in many European countries during the last two decades, particularly in North and Western Europe. Among women, mortality rates are still increasing in many countries, although in a few populations, rates are beginning to stabilize, notably in the high-risk countries within Eastern Europe (Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic), and in Northern Europe (Denmark, Iceland and the United Kingdom). Men and women are clearly in very different phases of the smoking epidemic, and, as reflected in the mortality rates by birth cohort, the stage varies widely by country within each European region. That lung cancer mortality trends in men are on a downwards path in most European countries while female rates continue to rise, points to an urgent need for national and European prevention strategies that target tobacco cessation and prevention among European women."Lung	Pathophysiology	"The role of estrogens in the increased risk of lung adenocarcinoma in women remains uncertain. We reported that lung adenocarcinoma cell lines from female, but not male, patients with non-small cell lung cancer respond proliferatively and transcriptionally to estradiol (E(2)), despite equal protein expression of estrogen receptors (ER) alpha and beta. To test the hypothesis that nuclear localization of ER alpha corresponds to genomic E(2) activity in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females, cell fractionation, immunoblot, and confocal immunohistochemical microscopy were performed. We report for the first time that E(2) increases phospho-serine-118-ER alpha (P-ser118-ER alpha) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) nuclear colocalization in H1793, but not A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, derived from a female and male patient, respectively. ER beta was primarily in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, independent of E(2) treatment, and showed no difference between H1793 and A549 cells. E(2) induced higher transcription of endogenous ER alpha-regulated CCND1 in H1793 than in A549 cells. Likewise, higher rapid, non-genomic E(2)-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation was detected in H1793 compared with A549 cells, linking extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation to increased P-ser118-ER alpha. Furthermore, E(2) increased cyclin D1 and P-ser118-ER alpha nuclear localization in H1793, but not A549 cells. Together, our results indicate that nuclear localization of P-ser118-ER alpha provides one explanation for sex-dependent differences in E(2)-genomic responses in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently seen in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), especially in Asian females with adenocarcinoma. The frequency of mutation and the factors associated requires to be elucidated by analyzing a large number of consecutive clinical samples. We summarized the result of the EGFR mutation analysis for 1,176 patients performed at the time of diagnosis or relapse. The PNA-LNA PCR clamp, a highly sensitive detection method for the EGFR mutation, was employed. For fresh cases a portion of samples isolated to establish the diagnosis of lung cancer was used. For cases with a relapsed disease archival tissue were tested. The variables associated with the EGFR mutation after removing the confound factors were investigated by the logistic analysis using the samples collected in our university (n = 308) where detailed information on patients were available. The frequency of the EGFR mutation and its subtypes were investigated using all samples (n = 1,176). The EGFR mutation was significantly associated with adenocarcinoma (p = 0.006) and light-smoking (p < 0.0001), but not gender. The deletions in exon 19 were more frequently associated with male gender while exon 21 deletions were with female gender (p = 0.0011). The overall frequency of the EGFR mutation was 31%. Our result suggests that the female predominance in the EGFR mutation rate is a reflection of a higher frequency of adenocarcinoma in females. The gender difference in the mutation subtypes may provide a clue for the mechanism of the occurrence of the EGFR mutation."Lung	Review	"Epidemiological studies clearly outline some disparities in cancer onset, progression as well as prognosis and therapeutic response between sexes. In particular, in lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death, at least in Western countries, a gender disparity appears now to emerge, especially for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Such a disparity is apparently due to a variety of mechanisms, ranging from genetic and epigenetic differences to gender-specific lifestyle as well as to behavioral causes and, clearly, to sex hormones activity. Here we briefly recapitulate gender differences in terms of risk factors, histopathological features and pathogenetic mechanisms in NSCLC, and hypothesize that a gender-oriented pharmacology could beneficially impact on innovative therapeutic strategies."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) has been reported to be overexpressed in the development and progression of many tumor types. SRC-3 has been detected in several lung cancer cell lines, but its expression and clinical significance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unclear. In this study, 48 NSCLC tissues were collected and tissue microarrays were performed. The expression of SRC-3 was examined using nickel-intensified IHC. The results showed that of these 48 cases, 18 (37.5%) exhibited high levels of SRC-3 immunoreactivity, 23 (47.9%) exhibited moderate levels of SRC-3 immunoreactivity, and 7 (14.6%) were negative; thus, the total frequency of SRC-3 overexpression was 85.4% (41/48). This SRC-3 overexpression frequency was similar to the overexpression frequency observed for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (82.1% vs 90%) and for metastasis and non-metastasis patients (84.6% vs 85.7%). Data analysis demonstrated a significantly higher overexpression frequency in male patients compared with that in female patients (88.6% vs 76.9%). However, female patients tended to have higher expression levels of SRC-3, as measured by immunoreactivity, than male patients. These results demonstrate a high frequency of SRC-3 overexpression in NSCLC with a gender difference, suggesting that there is a specific role for SRC-3 in the pathogenesis of NSCLC."Lung	Pathophysiology	"The androgen receptor (AR) mediates the effects of male sex steroids. There are major sex differences in lung development and pathologies, including lung cancer. In this report, we show that Ar is mainly expressed in type II pneumocytes and the bronchial epithelium of murine lung and that androgen treatment increases AR protein levels in lung cells. Androgen administration altered significantly murine lung gene expression profiles; for example, by up-regulating transcripts involved in oxygen transport and down-regulating those in DNA repair and DNA recombination. Androgen exposure also affected the gene expression profile in a human lung adenocarcinoma-derived cell line, A549, by up- or down-regulating significantly some 200 transcripts, including down-regulation of genes involved in cell respiration. Dexamethasone treatment of A549 cells augmented expression of transcript sets that overlapped in part with those up-regulated by androgen in these cells. Moreover, a human lung cancer tissue array revealed that different lung cancer types are all AR-positive. Our results indicate that adult lung is an AR target tissue and suggest that AR plays a role in lung cancer biology."Lung	Management	"Although biologically based sex differences in the smoking patterns, epidemiology, biomedical markers, and survival rates associated with lung cancer are well documented, examinations of psychosocial gender differences are scarce.This cross-sectional study examined gender differences in psychosocial factors that are important in the medical management of lung cancer.A convenience sample of patients who were attending a multidisciplinary lung cancer treatment center (Markey Cancer Center, Lexington, Kentucky) were invited to complete a psychosocial needs assessment. Eligibility criteria included primary diagnosis of lung cancer, age > or =18 years, and being cognitively intact. Measures focused on psychosocial resources, treatment decision-making, social consequences of treatments, and treatment outcomes. Data were collected between the fall of 2005 and the summer of 2006.A total of 47 women and 53 men (mean [SD] age, 62.81 [12.01] years; 95% white) completed the needs assessment. Gender was not found to be associated with demographic characteristics, time until diagnosis, treatment, or survival rate. Smoking histories differed significantly in the proportion of women and men who smoked or were former smokers (P = 0.01) as well as the age when they began to smoke (P = 0.02). There were no significant gender differences in social support networks, general coping, information needs, treatment decision satisfaction, functional health, life satisfaction, financial impact, or service needs. However, significant gender differences did indicate that women favored spiritual practices (P = 0.02) and religious coping (P = 0.04), and were more likely to endorse having a life mission (P = 0.03) and being part of a divine plan (P = 0.01).Previous research has found that religiousness and spirituality improved depressive symptoms and may ease end-of-life despair. In the present study of patients with lung cancer, gender differences in religiousness and spirituality suggest that this may be especially true for women, and that interventions should be directed toward their religious practices and coping."Lung	Management	"Approximately 30% of patients who are diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are classified as N2 on the basis of metastasis to the mediastinal lymph nodes. The effectiveness of surgery for these patients remains controversial. Although surgeries in recent years are proved to be effective to some extent, yet due to many reasons, 5-year survival rate after surgery varies greatly from patient to patient. Thus it is necessary to select patients who have a high probability of being be cured through an operation, who are suitable to receive surgery and the best surgical methods so as to figure out the conditions under which surgical treatment can be chosen and the factors that may influence prognosis.165 out of 173 patients with N2 NSCLC were treated with surgery in our department from January 1999 to May 2003, among whom 130 were male, 43 female and the sex ratio was 3:1, average age 53, ranging from 29 to 79. The database covers the patients' complete medical history including the information of their age, sex, location and size of tumor, date of operation, surgical methods, histologic diagnosis, clinical stage, post-operative TNM stage, neoadjuvant treatment and chemoradiotherapy. The methods of clinical stage verification include chest X-ray, chest CT, PET, mediastinoscopy, bronchoscope (+?), brain CT or MRI, abdominal B ultrasound (or CT), and bone ECT. The pathological classification was based on the international standard for lung cancer (UICC 1997). Survival time was analyzed from the operation date to May 2008 with the aid of SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) program. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Log-rank test and Cox multiplicity were adopted respectively to obtain patients' survival curve, survival rate and the impact possible factors may have on their survival rate.The median survival time was 22 months, with 3-year survival rate reaching 28.1% and 5-year survival rate reaching 19.0%. Age, sex, different histological classification and postoperative chemoradiotherapy seem to have no correlation with 5-year survival rate. In all N2 subtypes, 5-year survival rate is remarkably higher for unexpected N2 discovered at thoractomy and proven N2 stage before preoperative work-up and receive a mediastinal down-staging after induction therapy (P < 0.01), reaching 30.4% and 27.3% respectively. 5-year survival rate for single station lymph node metastasis were 27.8%, much higher compared with 9.3% for multiple stations (P < 0.001). Induction therapy which downstages proven N2 in 73.3% patients gains them the opportunity of surgery. The 5-year survival rate were 23.6% and 13.0% for patients who had complete resection and those who had incomplete resection (P < 0.001). Patients who underwent lobectomy (23.2%) have higher survival rate, less incidence rate of complication and mortality rate, compared with pneumonectomy (14.8%) (P < 0.01). T4 patients has a 5-year survival rate as low as 11.1%, much less than T1 (31.5%) and T2 (24.3%) patients (P = 0.01). It is noted through Cox analysis that completeness of resection, number of positive lymph node stations and primary T status have significant correlativity with 5-year survival rate.It is suggested that surgery (lobectomy preferentially) is the best solution for T1 and T2 with primary tumor have not invaded pleura or the distance to carina of trachea no less than 2 cm, unexpected N2 discovered at thoractomy when a complete resection can be applied, and proven N2 discovered during preoperative work-up and is down-staged after induction therapy. Surgical treatment is the best option, lobectomy should be prioritized in operational methods since ise rate of complication and morality are lower than that of pneumonectomy. Patients' survival time will not benefit from surgery if they are with lymph nodes metastasis of multiple stations (Bulky N2 included) and T4 which can be partially removed. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases long-term survival rate of those with N2 proven prior to surgery. However, postoperative radiotherapy decreases local recurrence rate but does not contribute to patients' long-term survival rate."Lung	Management	"Erlotinib is a standard of treatment for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer after failure of initial therapy. Patient selection based on clinical factors is under discussion.We analyzed the outcome in relation to clinical factors of 121 consecutive Caucasian patients treated with erlotinib in a routine clinical setting in a comprehensive cancer center and 2 regional oncology centers.For patients with erlotinib treatment at the 1st/2nd/3rd/> or = 4th line, progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.5/3.5/2.5/3.0 months, and overall survival (OS) was 8.0/8.5/7.8/6.5 months. Patients with adenocarcinoma had an improved PFS, but a similar OS. Never-smokers had longer PFS (7 months) and OS (13 months) than smokers and ex-smokers. Male patients had a slightly longer survival than female patients (PFS 3.0 vs. 2.5 months, OS 8.5 vs. 7.0 months). After adjustment for smoking and histology, the gender difference in OS was significant (adjusted hazard ratio 0.57). Patients with clinically relevant skin toxicity (grade 2, 3) had a significantly prolonged PFS and OS. Patients with partial response on 1st radiological evaluation had a significantly prolonged PFS and OS.Among clinical factors, never-smoking status and male gender predicted a prolonged survival. During treatment, skin toxicity and radiological response were related to better survival."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and cigarette smoking is the major environmental factor for its development. To elucidate the genetic differences in the susceptibility to lung cancer among individuals, genetic factors involved in tobacco-induced lung cancers have been extensively investigated and a number of genetic polymorphisms have been identified to date as candidates. Most of the polymorphisms identified are of genes encoding proteins associated with the activity to metabolize tobacco smoke carcinogens and to suppress mutations induced by those carcinogens, and functional significances have been elucidated for some of these polymorphisms. However, the significance of these polymorphisms in the contribution to lung cancer development still remains unclear. Recently, several novel lung cancer susceptibility genes, including those on chromosomes 5p15.33, 6p21, and 15q24-25.1, have been identified by large-scale genome-wide association (GWA) studies. The 15q25 region contains three nicotine acetylcholine receptor subunit genes, and their polymorphisms have been also reported as being associated with nicotine dependence. The 5p15.33 region is associated with risks specifically for lung adenocarcinoma, the commonest histological type and weakly associated with smoking. This locus has been shown to be associated with risks for a wide variety of cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma. Associations of the 6q21 region have not been consistently replicated among studies. The 6q23-25 and 13q31.3 regions were also identified by recent GWA studies as being associated with risk for lung cancer, particularly in never-smokers. However, contributions of genetic differences on these five loci to the susceptibility to overall lung cancer seem to be small. There are several molecular pathways for the development of lung adenocarcinomas, and environmental factors for their development are still unclear, especially those in never-smokers. In addition, geographic differences as well as gender differences in lung cancer risk have been indicated. Furthermore, various genes identified by candidate gene association studies have not been reevaluated for their significance together with genes identified by GWA studies in the same population. Therefore, further studies will be necessary to assess the individual susceptibility to lung cancer based on the combination of polymorphisms in multiple genes, and to establish a novel way of evaluating the individual risk for lung cancer for its prevention."Lung	Outcomes	"Macao Cancer Registry was established in 2003. It is population-based and has been collecting cancer reports from all possible settings where pathological and management services are available. To get a better idea over the prognosis and survival of all and major cancer sites, a survival analysis was here performed to estimate the relative survival rates of cancers diagnosed and registered during 2003 to 2005 with a follow-up of vital status till 31 Dec, 2008.3,244 cancer cases diagnosed and registered during 2003-2005 in Macao Cancer Registry were considered for analysis. Cases of in-situ carcinoma, extreme age and poor data quality were deliberately excluded, leaving 2,623 newly diagnosed cancers eligible. Vital status of registered cases through 31 December 2008 was confirmed by matching with death certificates and review from the Hospital Information System (HIS) of the only public hospital. Observed survival rates were calculated using a Life Table method, and relative survival rates were examined using an algorithm written in SAS by Paul Dickman with minor adaptations. Apart from general relative survival rates, specific rates by sex and age strata were also estimated.3-year and 5-year relative survival rates of all cancers were 61% and 56% respectively for both sexes; (54% and 47%, respectively, for males and 68% and 64%for females). The 3-year relative survival rates for major cancer sites ranged from 21% to 90%, with lung cancer showing the lowest and female breast cancer the highest. 5-year relative survival rates for major cancer sites ranged from 18% to 85%, with liver cancer showing the lowest and again female breast cancer the highest. Female cancer patients had higher relative survival than males across the 5-year follow up period, with a sex difference of nearly 15%.Comparison of survival rates from this first trial in Macao, deriving survival statistics from population-based cancer registration, with other Asian countries/cities, like Taiwan, Singapore and Japan, showed Macao and Taiwan to have the closest estimates for 3-year relative survival. Random variation was found to exist in the stratification of sex and age in certain cancer sites due to scarce case numbers in the subgroups. It is important to note that the 3-year survival rates are relatively more consistent and reliable than 4-year or 5-year ones. Promotion of reporting cancer stage by physicians as well as improvement in data quality of cancer registration are essential to allow further informative statistics derived from the cancer registry with reference to cancer prevention."Lung	Epidemiology	"The aim of this study was to assess sex-associated differences in lung cancer patients in Eastern Switzerland.All 670 lung cancer patients referred to the cancer center in St. Gallen between January 2000 and December 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. We investigated sex-associated differences in age, smoking habits, histology, stage, treatment and survival.There were 474 (71%) men and 196 (29%) women with lung cancer. Mean age at the time of diagnosis was 64 years for women and 67 years for men (p = 0.01). Of the patients <55 years of age, 47 (24%) were women and only 65 (14%) were men. Men smoked significantly more than women (median pack-years: 50 vs. 30; p < 0.001). Of the heavy smokers (>40 pack-years), 278 (56%) were men and 68 (33%) were women. More men had squamous cell carcinoma (36%) than women (17%). Conversely, more women presented with adenocarcinoma (48%) than men (27%). No significant sex-associated differences were observed when analyzing first treatments received. Median overall survival was 10 months for both sexes.In Eastern Switzerland, women with lung cancer were younger, more likely to have smoked significantly less and more likely to have adenocarcinoma, compared to men with lung cancer. These findings are consistent with those found in other western populations."Lung	Outcomes	"Women with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) appear to have better survival. This study aimed to evaluate sex differences in NSCLC in recent years. The true effect of gender on the overall survival was analyzed taking other prognostic factors into account.A cohort of consecutive NSCLC patients was prospectively enrolled from January 2002 to December 2005, and followed-up until December 2006. They were clinically and pathologically staged and underwent homogenous treatment algorithms. Demographics, histology, and disease stage between sexes were compared. The clinical prognostic factors to be analyzed in addition to gender included stage, age, smoking history and histology. The overall survival of females and males within relevant subgroups defined by smoking history and histology was also compared.Of the 738 patients, 695 were analyzed with a definite stage (94.2%; 315 females and 380 males), which was similar in both sexes. Females were younger (median age: 59.5 years vs. 65.0 years; P<0.001) and more likely to have adenocarcinoma (81% vs. 60.5%; P<0.001). Patients with earlier stage, younger patients, never-smokers and females had better overall survival in univariate analyses and no significant survival difference was noted between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Multivariate analyses demonstrated age, smoking history and gender to have a hazard ratio 1.46 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.21-1.76; P<0.001), 1.27 (95% CI 0.97-1.65; P=0.082), and 1.18 (95% CI 0.90-1.55; P=0.226), respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed the survival of never-smoker males with adenocarcinoma was similar to that of females.There are sex-related differences in the clinico-pathologic characteristics and survival of NSCLC patients. The survival advantages of females could be attributed to the younger age and lower smoking prevalence. Never-smokers with adenocarcinoma should be given special attention regardless of sex as they imply better survival with different treatment outcomes."Lung	Management	"To identify any gender differences in the outcomes of concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).A comparative retrospective review of the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes between female and male NSCLC patients receiving chemoradiotherapy.Of a total of 204 patients, 44 (22%) were females and 160 (78%) were males. There was no difference in age, body weight loss, performance status or disease stage between the sexes, whereas never-smokers and adenocarcinoma were more common in female patients (55% vs. 3%, P < 0.001, and 73% vs. 55%, P = 0.034, respectively). Full cycles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy at a total dose of 60 Gy were administered to approximately 70% and >80% of the patients, respectively, of both sexes. Grade 3-4 neutropenia was observed in 64% of the female patients and 63% of the male patients. Severe esophagitis was encountered in <10% of the patients, irrespective of the sex. The response rate was higher in the female than in the male patients (93% vs. 79%, P = 0.028), but the median progression-free survival did not differ between the sexes. The median survival time in the female and male patients was 22.3 and 24.3 months, respectively (P = 0.64).This study failed to show any gender differences in the survival or toxicity among patients treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. These results contrast with the better survival in female patients undergoing surgery for localized disease or chemotherapy for metastatic disease."Lung	Outcomes	"To determine if sex associated differences exist in presentation and survival of patients undergoing resection for early stage nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Retrospective review of 2207 patients with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Summary Stage I, II or III (local or regional disease) patients eligible for surgery, nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed and treated in WV between 1993 and 2000, which underwent surgery as a first course of treatment. Data set obtained from the West Virginia Cancer Registry.1332 male cases and 875 female cases were reviewed. No statistically significant difference was found with mean age of diagnosis (men 66.5 years; women 67.2 years). A greater proportion of women had adenocarcinoma (p < 0.0001), lower grade (p = 0.002), and lower SEER summary stage (p = 0.009). There was no difference in laterality of tumor, 30-day post surgery survival or surgical procedure between men and women. Regression analysis showed a higher hazard ratio was associated with a increasing stage, grade, and those > or =65 years of age while lower hazard ratio was associated with adenocarcinoma.This study found that stage, grade, age, and histology, but not sex was the significant prognostic indicators of death in five years."Lung	Outcomes	"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, but the disease course differs between the sexes. To the authors' knowledge, sex-based differences in outcomes among the population of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving radiation have not been well defined.Data for 831 patients (319 women and 512 men) with stage I to III NSCLC and treated with > or =45 Gray of radiation between March 1985 and November 2003 were retrospectively analyzed (grading determined according to the 1997 American Joint Committee on Cancer grading system).Women were more likely to have earlier stage disease, to have smoked <50 pack-years, and to have adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma (all P < or = .001). For each stage, treatment did not differ between women and men. Five-year survival rates were significantly better for women than for men: overall survival (OS), 28.6% versus 16.1% (P < .001); disease-free survival, 31.2% versus 20.1% (P = .02); and distant metastasis-free survival, 48.8% versus 37.6% (P < .02). Among patients with medically inoperable stage I NSCLC, women had improved 5-year OS compared with men (30.0% vs 13.1%; P = .004). On multivariate analysis, male sex, weight loss, age > or =65 years, and stage III disease were found to be associated with poorer OS (all P < 0.02).Although women are more likely to have earlier stage disease, among patients with medically inoperable stage I NSCLC, women still have a better OS. Along with known prognostic factors, including age, weight loss, and stage, sex remained significant on multivariate analysis of OS, suggesting that sex is a determinant of outcome in NSCLC patients receiving radiation."Lung	Management	"Previous research suggests that disparities in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) survival can be explained in part by disparities in the receipt of cancer treatment. Few studies, however, have considered race and sex disparities in the timing and appropriateness of treatment across stages of diagnosis.To evaluate the relationship of sex and race with the receipt of timely and clinically appropriate NSCLC treatment for each stage of diagnosis.Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result data linked to Medicare claims for beneficiaries diagnosed with NSCLC between 1995 and 1999 were used to evaluate the relationship between race and sex with timely and appropriate NSCLC treatment while controlling for other demographic characteristics, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, and provider supply (N = 22,145).Overall adjusted rates of timely and appropriate treatment are 37.2%, 58.1%, and 29.2% for Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with stage I or II, III, and IV NSCLC, respectively. Among stage I or II patients, women were 25% less likely to receive timely surgical resection relative to men, and blacks were 66% less likely to receive timely and appropriate treatment than whites. Black men were least likely to receive resection (22.2% compared with 43.7% for white men). Blacks were 34% less likely to receive timely surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation for stage III disease and were 51% less likely to receive chemotherapy in a timely fashion for stage IV disease relative to whites.Significant variations in appropriate timely treatment were found within and across stages of diagnosis, confirming that sex and race differences in NSCLC treatment exist."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, involved in metabolism of tobacco carcinogens, are also involved in estrogen metabolism and many are regulated by estrogens. These genes may thus be of relevance to gender-specific differences in lung cancer risk, particularly in early-onset lung cancer, where a high proportion of women is observed. We conducted a case-control study to investigate genetic polymorphisms in cytochromes that might modify the risk of developing early-onset lung cancer. In total, 638 Caucasian patients under the age of 51 with primary lung cancer and 1300 cancer-free control individuals, matched by age and sex, were included in this analysis. Thirteen polymorphisms in the CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP2A13, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes were analyzed. No significant association was found for any of the analyzed polymorphisms and lung cancer risk overall. However, among women, a significantly increased risk of early-onset lung cancer was observed for carriers of the minor allele of CYP1B1 SNP rs1056836 [odds ratio (OR) 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-2.94; P < 0.001]. Also, a non-significant increase in lung cancer risk was observed in the group of women carriers of the minor allele of CYP2A13 SNP rs1709084 (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.00-2.70; P = 0.05). The effect of these two polymorphisms was shown to be modified by smoking. Haplotype analysis was performed for CYP1B1 and CYP2A13. No differences between cases and controls were observed for both genes (P = 0.63 and P = 0.42 for CYP1B1 and CYP2A13, respectively). Our results suggest that the CYP1B1 and the CYP2A13 genotypes may contribute to individual susceptibility to early-onset lung cancer in women."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Our recent report indicated that MGMT hypermethylation is more common in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) in males, and smokers than in adenocarcinomas (ADC) in females, and nonsmokers. More interestingly, MGMT hypermethylation in SCC and ADC was pronouncedly influenced by gender factor, not by smoking status. We questioned whether 17beta-estradiol could modulate the machinery of promoter methylation to cause the gender difference of MGMT hypermethylation in lung cancer.Two MGMT hypermethylated Ch27 and H1355 lung cancer cell lines were treated with or without 17beta-estradiol and the status of hypermethylation was examined by methylated specific methylation (MSP) as compared with both cells treated with demethylating agents, 5-AZA-dC (AZA) or TSA.Our data showed that 17beta-estradiol, similar to AZA, diminished the MGMT hypermethylation and restored MGMT mRNA expression, which was not observed in the case of TSA. Western blotting showed that 17beta-estradiol markedly reduced DNMT1 expression in Ch27 and H1355 cells, but slightly reduced HDAC1 expression. Consequently, acetylated H3 and H4 histone levels were slightly increased by 17beta-estradiol in both cell types. In addition, ChIP analysis revealed that 17beta-estradiol simultaneously diminished the binding activity of both proteins on the MGMT promoter of both cell lines.17beta-Estradiol decreased DNMT1 and HDAC1 protein expressions and their binding activity on MGMT promoter, and this may partially contribute to the gender difference of MGMT hypermethylation in lung cancer."Lung	Management	"Gefitinib is effective in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Smoking status also affects the responsiveness to gefitinib, but it has not been fully evaluated whether a sex difference exists in the influence of smoking on the efficacy of gefitinib in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.We reviewed the clinical records of 260 Japanese patients with lung adenocarcinoma who received gefitinib therapy (250 mg/day), and whose smoking status was known. Tumour response and survival were evaluated and stratified by smoking status and gender.Among the 260 patients, 157 were male (60%). Median pack-years was 40 (range 8-160) and 23 (range 1-74) in male and female smokers, respectively. Objective response was observed in 62 (23.8%) of the 260 patients, and 1-year overall survival and progression-free survival were 45.1 and 24.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that smoking status (pack-years) was an independent predictive factor for response to gefitinib [odds ratio (OR) = 0.971, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.947-0.995; P = 0.0159] in male patients, but not in female patients (OR = 0.999, 95%CI = 0.957-1.042). Additionally, pack-years significantly influenced the overall survival in males (hazard ratio = 1.010; 95%CI = 1.002-1018, P = 0.0169), while differential survival of females was not significantly predicted by this factor (P = 0.7639).In male patients with lung adenocarcinoma, cumulative smoking significantly affected response and survival following gefitinib treatment, while in female patients, responsiveness to gefitinib was independent of smoking status. These results suggest that the influence of smoking habit on responsiveness to gefitinib is gender specific."Lung	Management	"Gefitinib is effective in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

In the lung recent data have shown local production of estrogens from androgens via the action of aromatase enzyme and higher levels of estrogen in tumor tissue as compared with surrounding normal lung tissue. High levels of aromatase expression are also maintained in metastases as compared with primary tumors. Consistent with these findings, clinical studies suggest that aromatase expression may be a useful predictive biomarker for prognosis in the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung malignancy. Low levels of aromatase associate with a higher probability of long-term survival in older women with early stage NSCLC. Treatment of lung NSCLC xenografts in vivo with an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane) alone or combined with standard cisplatin chemotherapy elicits a significant reduction in tumor progression as compared to paired controls. Further, lung cancer progression is also governed by complex interactions between estrogen and growth factor signaling pathways to stimulate the growth of NSCLC as well as tumor-associated angiogenesis. We find that combination therapy with the multitargeted growth factor receptor inhibitor vandetanib and the estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant inhibit tumor growth more effectively than either treatment administered alone. Thus, incorporation of antiestrogen treatment strategies in standard antitumor therapies for NSCLC may contribute to improved patient outcome, an approach that deserves to be tested in clinical trials."Lung	Clinical	"Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer death related cause in the world. Its clinical presentation usually corresponds to advanced stages. The indication of screening programs for the diagnosis in early phases has been debated for years.To know the clinical characteristics in the presentation of the lung cancer in our health care area.All of the incident lung cancer cases for 3 years (January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1999) among those patients with usual residence in the Santiago de Compostela health care area were retrospectively collected from the available information in the Codification Service. The histological type was graded according to the World Health Organization classification. Date of death was obtained from the patient's clinical history, mortality record, or telephonic calls to the patient's home. The rest of the information was obtained from the clinical records of the patient and Pathology Service.Four-hundred and eighty-one lung cancer cases were diagnosed (incident gross rate of 41.79 per 100,000 inhabitants and year). Median age was 66.9 years (interquartile range 60.5-74.4), 92.77% being males and 94.1% corresponding to smokers or former smokers. The most prevalent symptoms motivating the visit were general syndrome (20%), thoracic pain (19%) and hemoptisis (17%). A group of patients (56), fundamentally males, had an incidental diagnosis.The incidence of lung cancer seems to be high in our health care area. The standard patient with lung cancer in this health care area is a 67-year-old, male, who smokes, diagnosed in advanced stages, who consults due to a general syndrome and/or chest pain. Some of the symptoms appear with significant gender differences. Likewise, there are differences between histologies, the high frequency of chest pain in adenocarcinoma being outstanding, although it is also the first cause for consultation in small cell lung cancer. On the contrary, hemoptisis, the most frequent consultation cause in squamous cell carcinoma and the general syndrome in the big cells type or with clinical-radiological diagnosis."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer has become increasingly common in women, and gender differences in the physiology and pathogenesis of the disease have suggested a role for estrogens.

Multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to identify predictors of chemotherapy treatment and factors associated with use of cisplatin/carboplatin (platinum) and either a taxane or gemcitabine versus other treatments.Chemotherapy use increased from approximately 28% of Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients diagnosed in 1997 to 36% of patients diagnosed in 2002. Doublet therapy was most commonly used as first-line therapy, received by 74% of chemotherapy-treated patients across all study years. Use of doublet therapy with platinum and either a taxane or gemcitabine also increased over time (with the largest increase for gemcitabine combinations from 0.3% in 1997 to 11.8% in 2002). Males were more likely than females to be treated with chemotherapy (odds ratios [95% CI]: 1.14 [1.06-1.22]), as were patients in the Northeast and South relative to patients in the West (1.24 [1.13-1.36] and 1.33 [1.20-1.47], respectively).Use of first-line chemotherapy treatment among elderly Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients is low, but appears to be increasing, with potential regional and gender differences in treatment. These findings are likely to be of interest to clinicians and policymakers."Lung	Outcomes	"To study time trends in lung cancer mortality by separating the incidence and case-fatality rates, in association with age, period, and cohort effects.Lung cancer cases (n = 44,139) diagnosed between 1996 and 2002 in Taiwan were analyzed by decomposing the time trend in mortality into incidence and case-fatality rates. Descriptive data, together with periodical treatment distribution (surgery, chemotherapy, and others) were analyzed using a Bayesian age, period, and cohort (BAPC) model.Midterm mortality (2-year age-adjusted standardized mortality rate) has been decreasing for male lung cancer patients since about 2000, mainly because of a decrease in incidence during this period. For women, 2-year age-adjusted standardized mortality rate has been slightly increasing, mainly as a result of increasing incidence. There were small improvements (3-6%) in the short-term (1-year) case-fatality rate, possibly owing to increased utilization (approximately 15-18%) of chemotherapy. The midterm (2-year) case-fatality rate remained roughly the same, especially for men.Using a new BAPC model, we found that the trends in mortality for lung cancer paralleled the changes in incidence, with opposite effects in men and women. Increased utilization of chemotherapy might have partly accounted for the small improvement in the case-fatality rate. The contributions of other unmeasured factors such as staging and histologic distribution remain to be clarified in future studies."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer has reached epidemic proportions in women, and is now the most common cause of cancer death among both men and women in the United States. While smoking rates have declined marginally in women, the rising impact of lung cancer in women may imply that women are at higher risk from carcinogens secondary to underlying factors related to sex. These factors include differences in female physiology such as bronchial responsiveness and airway size, sex-based differences in nicotine metabolism via the cytochrome p450 system driven by hormones, and differences in DNA repair capacity, as well as the evolution of cigarettes. These hypotheses will be explored in depth in this article."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. In recent years the incidence of lung cancer in men has been declining, while in women it has been increasing. A number of population-based studies have demonstrated gender-based differences in clinical and pathologic factors, as well as in survival related to lung cancer. Disparities in age, smoking practices, and histological subtypes are among the differences that have been identified. Gender disparity also has been observed in outcomes, with improved survival observed for women in a number of clinical trials. This article reviews the gender-related differences in clinical and pathologic factors and outcomes of patients with lung cancer observed in population-based studies and clinical trials."Lung	Review	"Gender differences in lung cancer incidence and outcome suggest a potential role for reproductive hormones. However, observational studies regarding menopausal hormone therapy use and lung cancer have given mixed results. Some have associated hormone therapy use with increased lung cancer risk, while others have shown no effect or found lower lung cancer risk in hormone therapy users. Against this background the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized controlled trial evaluating conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in postmenopausal women identified an increase in malignancies in the hormone therapy group during the post intervention period. Post hoc analyses identified a statistically significant increase in deaths from lung cancer for women in the hormone group largely related to effects on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The NSCLCs were more commonly poorly differentiated and were diagnosed at a metastatic stage, suggesting a hormone effect on already established lung cancer growth. Ongoing preclinical and clinical analyses have identified estrogen receptors in the nucleus and cytoplasm of lung tissue and lung cancers. More recently, intriguing associations among estrogen receptor expression, lung cancer histology, clinical prognosis, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations have been reported. The WHI clinical findings should be integrated into risk-benefit discussion with women considering combined hormone therapy use. In addition, the findings, together with ongoing studies evaluating estrogen receptor status and function, support further efforts to develop lung cancer intervention strategies targeting estrogen receptor expression."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Since the 1970s, there has been evidence for improved survival of women with lung cancer compared to men. Multiple analyses have demonstrated a survival advantage in women regardless of stage, histology, or treatment. The etiology for the improved prognosis is not yet fully elucidated, but is likely related to underlying biologic differences, including hormonal interactions. More recently, gender differences in response to newer agents such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors and anti-angiogenesis agents have been identified. Further exploration of tumor molecular, biologic, hormonal, and pharmacogenomic interactions may provide additional insight into the observed survival benefit for women and, ultimately, permit exploitation of these differences in our treatment selection for both women and men."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. While historically, more men than women have died from lung cancer as a result of higher numbers of male smokers, the sex mortality ratio is now showing signs of narrowing. Tumors in women with lung cancer may be slightly different to those in men with lung cancer. This review focuses on biomarkers differentially expressed between female and male patients with lung cancer. There is variation in gene expression between men and women in some genes that encode carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A1, GSTM). Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), a bombesin-like peptide, is present in two actively transcribed alleles in women compared with men. Higher prevalence of infection with oncogenic variants human papilloma viruses (HPVs) HPV16 and HPV18 has been suggested in women. A higher frequency of G to T transversion was found in the p53 gene in lung tumors of women. KRAS mutation was found to be more frequent in women with resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) than in men with resected NSCLC. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is more frequently found in lung tumors from women, but the confounding effect of tobacco exposure may explain this difference. Lower levels of ERCC1 and BRCA1 have been reported in women with NSCLC. Lung tumors from women are more likely to express estrogen receptors than those from men. An in silico analysis of transcriptome datasets from lung cancer patients demonstrated that only seven genes (in at least two studies) had significantly different expression patterns in male versus female patients. All of these genes are localized on the sex chromosomes: one on chromosome X and six on chromosome Y. Many areas remain under debate and there are still significant gaps in our understanding, particularly how sex-linked factors relate to lung cancer risk, and to biological and clinical behaviors. Future research into lung cancer needs to address these gender differences more specifically."Lung	Review	"Although the prevalence of lung cancer in men has been decreasing, it has been increasing in women. Without a doubt, lung cancer is a major health problem for women in the USA, not only owing to its high incidence rate but, more alarming, the high mortality rate. Lung cancer kills more women each year than breast, ovarian and uterine cancers combined. One of the most important risk factors for the development of lung cancer in both men and women is cigarette smoking. Unfortunately, the prevalence of smoking among women has increased significantly since 1980, which is a major concern as epidemiologic data suggest that women may be more susceptible to developing lung cancer than men. Many will argue, however, that after adjusting for tobacco exposure, some studies have failed to show that women are at a higher risk for developing lung cancer. Indeed, the increased risk of lung cancer in women remains controversial. There is, however, little controversy to the fact that the biology of lung cancer differs between the sexes. This paper summarizes the explanations for the sex differences in lung cancer, including differences in molecular abnormalities, growth factor receptors, hormonal influences, differences in cytochrome P-450 enzymes and DNA repair capacity, as well as variations in treatment outcomes."Lung	Outcomes	"It remains controversial whether there is a gender difference in survival of patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer.We retrospectively analyzed 2770 patients (1689 men and 1081 women) with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent pulmonary resection between 1995 and 2005 at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo. A gender difference in survival was studied in all patients, in those divided according to histology or pathologic stage, and in propensity-matched gender pairs.There were no differences in background, such as preoperative pulmonary function, operation procedures, or operative mortality. The proportions of adenocarcinoma and pathologic stage I in women were greater than those in men (93.6% vs 61.7% and 71.4% vs 58.6%, respectively) (P < .001). Overall 5-year survival of women was better than that of men (81% vs 70%, P < .001). In adenocarcinoma, the overall 5-year survival for women was better than that for men in pathologic stage I (95% vs 87%, P < .001) and in pathologic stage II or higher (58% vs 51%, P = .017). In non-adenocarcinoma, there was no significant gender difference in survival in pathologic stage I (P = .313) or pathologic stage II or higher (P = .770). The variables such as age, smoking status, histology, and pathologic stage were used for propensity score matching, and survival analysis of propensity score-matched gender pairs did not show a significant difference (P = .69).Women had better survival than men; however, there was no survival advantage in propensity-matched gender pairs. A gender difference in survival was observed only in the adenocarcinoma subset, suggesting pathobiology in adenocarcinoma in women might be different from that of men."Lung	Outcomes	"It remains controversial whether there is a gender difference in survival of patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer.We retrospectively analyzed 2770 patients (1689 men and 1081 women) with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent pulmonary resection between 1995 and 2005 at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo.

A sizable literature describes a direct relationship between social support and improved cancer clinical outcomes. This study explored the extent of social support and its potential association with survival and adverse events in geriatric lung cancer patients.One hundred thirteen patients, who were aged 65 years or older, had incurable cancer, and were enrolled in one of two chemotherapy trials, completed the Lubben Social Network Scale, a validated instrument that measures social support. All were followed for survival and chemotherapy-related adverse events.The median age (range) of the cohort was 74 years (65-91), and performance scores of 0, 1, or 2 were observed in 29%, 55%, and 16%, respectively. Forty-two percent were women. This cohort had a high level of social support: 81% reported they ""always"" had someone to take them to medical appointments. However, there were no gender-based differences in social support and no associations between social support and either survival or adverse events.In this cohort of geriatric lung cancer patients - all of whom were treated during a clinical trial - there was a high level of social support. However, there were no gender-based differences in extent of social support, and the latter did not predict clinical outcomes."Lung	Epidemiology	"The triennial mortality rates for lung cancer in the two decades 1981-2001 in the province of Lecce, Italy, are significantly higher than those for the entire region of Apulia (to which the Province of Lecce belongs) and the national reference rates. Moreover, analyzing the rates in the three-year periods 1993-95, 1996-98 and 1999-01, there is a dramatic increase in mortality for both males and females, which still remains essentially unexplained: to understand the extent of this phenomenon, it is worth noting that the standardized mortality rate for males in 1999-01 is equal to 13.92 per 10000 person-years, compared to a value of 6.96 for Italy in the 2000-2002 period.These data have generated a considerable concern in the press and public opinion, which with little scientific reasoning have sometimes identified suspected culprits of the risk excess (for example, the emission caused by a number of large industrial sites located in the provinces of Brindisi and Taranto, bordering the Province of Lecce). The objective of this paper is to study on a scientifically sound basis the spatial distribution of risk for lung cancer mortality in the province of Lecce. Our goal is to demonstrate that most of the previous explanations are not supported by data: to this end, we will follow a hybrid approach that combines both frequentist and Bayesian disease mapping methods. Furthermore, we define a new sequential algorithm based on a modified version of the Besag-York-MolliÃ© (BYM) model, suitably modified to detect geographical clusters of disease.Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for lung cancer in the province of Lecce: For males, the relative risk (measured by means of SMR, i.e. the ratio between observed and expected cases in each area under internal standardization) was judged to be significantly greater than 1 in many municipal areas, the significance being evaluated under the null hypothesis of neutral risk on the ground of area-specific p-values (denoted by rhoi); in addition, it was seen that high risk areas were not randomly distributed within the province, but showed a sharp clustering. The most perceptible cluster involved a collection of municipalities around the Maglie area (Istat code: 75039), while the association among the municipalities of Otranto, Poggiardo and Santa Cesarea Terme (Istat codes: 75057, 75061, 75072) was more ambiguous. For females, it was noteworthy the significant risk excess in the city of Lecce (Istat code: 75035), where an SMR of 1.83 and rhoi < 0.01 have been registered. BYM model for the province of Lecce: For males, Bayes estimates of relative risks varied around an overall mean of 1.04 with standard deviation of 0.1, with a minimum of 0.77 and a maximum of 1.25. The posterior relative risks for females, although smoothed, showed more variation than for males, ranging form 0.74 to 1.65, around a mean of 0.90 with standard deviation 0.12. For males, 95% posterior credible intervals of relative risks included unity in every area, whereas significantly elevated risk of mortality was confirmed in the Lecce area for females (95% posterior CI: 1.33 - 2.00). BYM model for the whole Apulia: For males, internally standardized maps showed several high risk areas bordering the province of Lecce, belonging to the province of Brindisi, and the presence of a large high risk region, including the southern part of the province of Brindisi and the eastern and southern part of the Salento peninsula, in which an increasing trend in the north-south direction was found.Ecological correlation study with deprivation (Cadum Index): For males, posterior mean of the ecological regression coefficient beta resulted to be 0.04 with 95% posterior credible interval equal to (-0.01, 0.08); similarly, beta was estimated as equal to -0.03 for females (95% posterior credible interval: -0.16, 0.10). Moreover, there was some indication of nonlinearly increasing relative risk with increasing deprivation for higher deprivation levels. For females, it was difficult to postulate the existence of any association between risk and deprivation.Cluster detection: cluster detection based on a modified BYM model identified two large unexplained increased risk clusters in the central-eastern and southern part of the peninsula. Other secondary clusters, which raise several complex interpretation issues, are present.Our results reduce the alleged role of the industrial facilities located around the province of Taranto: in particular, air pollution produced around the city of Taranto (which lies to the west of the province of Lecce) has been often identified as the main culprit of the mortality excess, a conclusion that was further supported by a recent study on the direction of prevailing winds on Salento. This hypothesis is contradicted by the finding that those municipalities that directly border on the province of Taranto (belonging to the so-called ""Jonico-Salentina"" band) are those that present low mortality rates (at least for males). In the same way, the responsibilities of energy production plants located in the province of Brindisi (Brindisi province lies to the north) appear to be of little relevance. For females, given the situation observed in the city of Lecce, and given the substantial increase in mortality observed in younger age classes, further investigation is required into the role played by changes in lifestyle, including greater net propensity to smoke that women have shown since the 80s onwards (a phenomenon which could be amplified in a city traditionally cultured and modern as Lecce, as the tobacco habit is a largely cultural phenomenon). For males, the presence of high levels of deprivation throughout the eastern and southern Salento is likely to play an important role: those with lower socio-economic status smoke more, and gender differences may be explained on the basis of the fact that in less developed areas women have less habit to tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking (and other harmful lifestyles), which are seen as purely masculine behaviour: research into the role of material deprivation and individual lifestyle differences between genders should be further developed."Lung	Review	"In the early 1900s, lung cancer was a rare malignancy in women, but starting from the 1960s it has progressively reached epidemic proportions, surpassing breast cancer in 1987 and becoming the leading cause of cancer deaths in many countries. Retrospective data show that the 5-year survival rate for women who have lung cancer is 15.6%, compared with 12.5% for men, and this improved survival could have important implications in the design and interpretation of lung cancer trials. Women have major responses to therapy regardless of stage, therapeutic modalities or histology. The increase of lung cancer incidence among women is reflected in their clinical trial participation, causing a survival improvement and suggesting the need of stratification by sex in future studies. No specific drugs for women with lung cancer are currently available, but researchers are devoting energies in this area in order to better understand the implication of gender differences in epidemiology, pathogenesis, prognosis and tumor response."Lung	Review	"In the early 1900s, lung cancer was a rare malignancy in women, but starting from the 1960s it has progressively reached epidemic proportions, surpassing breast cancer in 1987 and becoming the leading cause of cancer deaths in many countries.

We examined age and gender differences in Medicare expenditures for lung cancer decedents in the last year of life (LYOL) through a cross-sectional study of Medicare administrative and claims data.Participants were aged Medicare beneficiaries (>or=68) with lung cancer, who were covered by Parts A and B for 36 months before death (1996-1999; n = 13,120). Regression techniques were used to estimate age and gender differences in mean Medicare utilization and expenditures in the LYOL overall and by type of service, conditional on use: inpatient, outpatient, physician, skilled nursing facility (SNF), home health, and hospice, controlling for demographic, clinical, geographic, and supply characteristics.Women were more likely than men to use inpatient, SNF, home health, and hospice services. Women's average expenditures were approximately dollars 1,900 greater than men's, with differences attributed to higher average expenditures for SNF, home health, and hospice. Older cohorts used fewer inpatient and outpatient services and used more SNF and hospice services in their LYOL. Average Medicare expenditures were significantly lower in older cohorts (dollars 8,487 less for those age >or=85 at death than for those 68-74). Adjusting for age explains most of the gender differences in average Medicare expenditures. Remaining gender differences vary across age cohorts, with larger gender differences in social-supportive service expenditures among those 68-74 and 75-84 and outpatient and physician services among those 75-84 and >or=85.Our findings suggest that gender disparities in expenditures are generally small at the end of life for lung cancer decedents, particularly among the older cohorts. As expected, the bigger observed differences are by age although the direction of the association is not consistent across types of service. Higher expenditures for women on social-supportive services may reflect fewer informal supports for older women compared with men."Lung	Management	"Gender and age differences in medical care are well documented.

The present study was aimed at understanding the bases of these sex differences. To test the effect of estradiol on tumor progression, we used a mouse model based on conditional Kras expression and concurrent deletion of Tp53 following inhalation of an adenoviral vector expressing Cre recombinase (AdeCre). Ovariectomized females and males were treated with estradiol via a continuous-release capsule. Tumor multiplicity, tumor volume, and histological grade were determined at 10 weeks after AdeCre administration. Cell proliferation was monitored by Ki67 immunohistochemistry at 4 and 10 weeks after AdeCre administration. At 10 weeks, female mice had more than twice the number of tumors evident on the surface of the lungs than male mice; ovariectomy eliminated this sex difference. The estrogen treatment significantly increased tumor number and volume in ovariectomized females and in males. Histological character of the tumors ranged from adenoma to adenocarcinoma. Ovary-intact females exhibited higher grade tumors than ovariectomized females or males. Progression to higher histological grade was stimulated by estrogen in male mice but not in ovariectomized females. At 10 weeks after AdeCre administration, tumor cell Ki67-labeling varied widely, precluding assessment of an estrogen effect; however, at 4 weeks, Ki67 labeling of lung parenchymal cells was increased 3.5-fold by estrogen. In conclusion, estrogen acts as a promoter for lung adenocarcinoma in a genetically defined lung cancer model; estrogen-induced cell proliferation in the oncogene-initiated cells is likely to play a role in this tumor promoter activity."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Numerous epidemiological observations point to sex differences in lung cancer etiology and progression.

Therefore, we examined intratumoral estradiol concentrations in NSCLC to examine local actions of estrogens in NSCLC.Fifty-nine frozen specimens of NSCLC were available for liquid chromatography/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry to study intratumoral estradiol concentrations. In addition, A549 NSCLC cells stably expressing estrogen receptor (ER) alpha (A549 + ERalpha) or ERbeta (A549 + ERbeta) were used in vitro studies.Forty-three (73%) of 59 NSCLC showed higher concentration of estradiol in carcinoma tissues than the corresponding nonneoplastic lung tissues from the same patient, and intratumoral estradiol concentrations were significantly (P = 0.0002 and 2.2-fold) higher than the corresponding nonneoplastic lungs. The intratumoral concentration of estradiol was positively correlated with aromatase expression, tumor size, and Ki-67 status in ERalpha- or ERbeta-positive cases. In in vitro studies, estradiol significantly increased cell proliferation of A549 + ERalpha or A549 + ERbeta, which was significantly suppressed by selective ER modulators, tamoxifen or raloxifene. Both A549 + ERalpha and A549 + ERbeta cells expressed aromatase. The cell proliferation level in these cells was significantly increased under treatment with testosterone, and it was inhibited by addition of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole.These results suggest that estradiol is locally produced in NSCLC mainly by aromatase and plays an important role in the growth of ERalpha- or ERbeta-positive NSCLC. Therefore, use of selective ER modulators and/or aromatase inhibitors may be clinically effective in NSCLC that are positive for both ER and aromatase."Lung	Pathophysiology	"The possible involvement of gender-dependent factors has been suggested in human non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), but their precise roles remain largely unclear.

A part from the airport and the harbour, mainly for passenger traffic to Greece, a wide industrial area is present (petrochemical, power plants, chemical pharmaceutical, metallurgical, manufacturing). In seven municipalities, illegal dumps have been found. South west of Brindisi is the province of Taranto, whose industrial area includes steels factory a refinery and a cement factory. In both provinces, an area at ""high risk of environmental crisis, has been identified by the Italian Ministry of Environment. In the Brindisi area, mortality from all causes, cancers and respiratory diseases. in 1990-1994 was found to be in excess.to estimate mortality among residents in the twenty municipalities of the province aggregated in four geographic areas: the one at ""high risk"" including the main town, and the areas located North. West and South of the Brindisi ""high risk"" area.descriptive geographical study.mortality analysis by gender, specific causes of death and two ten-year periods between 1981 and 2001. Standardised mortality ratios (Puglia region as referent population) and directly as well as age-standardized rates (ref. European population) have been computed.mortality from all causes and from forty selected causes.about 3,200 annual deaths have occurred in the province. Results for the high risk area confirm previous analyses while excesses in the other areas have appeared. A few municipalities, requiring a deeper investigation have been identified. Such excesses refer to mortality due to all causes, all cancers, stomach and lung cancers, respiratory and ischemic diseases.this study confirms excesses in the high risk areas and found mortality excesses in other municipality both among males and females. The results suggest to further investigate mortality both in the main town and in the small municipalities where illegal dump have been found and also in those located on the border with Taranto province."Lung	Epidemiology	"This study assesses the epidemiological pattern of lung cancer cell-types in Ireland, with identification of any underlying gender variations.Lung cancer incidence data, including the major cell-types: squamous-cell-carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinoma (AC), small-cell-lung-carcinoma (SCLC) and large-cell-carcinoma (LCC) were obtained from the national cancer registry (1994-2000), together with individual characteristics, such as age, gender, smoking status, and the year of diagnosis. Age-standardised incidence rates (ASIR), male-to-female (M: F) rate ratios (RR) of ASIR for SCC and AC, as well as RR of AC: SCC according to smoking status for both sexes, were estimated.

The study findings do not support the hypothesis that females in general are at higher risk for lung cancer development, but tobacco and histologic-specific susceptibility cannot be ruled out."Lung	Outcomes	"The purpose of this analysis was to assess the impact of pretreatment factors on quality of life (QOL) in patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, this study focused on the possible interaction between gender-specific baseline health-related QOL and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) in a prospective randomized lung cancer trial. QOL information, using validated instruments (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung [FACT-L], version 2, and Functional Living Index-Cancer [FLIC]), was prospectively collected in patients with locally advanced NSCLC treated on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 89-01. Between April 1990 and April 1994, 70 eligible patients participated in a phase III trial comparing a regimen containing sequential chemotherapy and radiation therapy versus sequential chemotherapy plus surgery. Of these 70 patients, 46 underwent pretreatment FLIC and 49 underwent pretreatment FACT-L. There was a significant interaction between gender and KPS using FLIC (P = 0.009), which also showed a trend toward significance with FACT (P = 0.09). Significant KPS-by-gender interactions were noted for FACT-L in the physical well-being and additional concerns-lung subscales (P = 0.012 and P = 0.0003, respectively). The results of both the FLIC and FACT-L demonstrated significantly lower scores corresponding to lower KPS values (P = 0.009 and P = 0.016, respectively). Results of this randomized study incorporating prospective QOL measurements suggested that in patients with locally advanced NSCLC, analyzing QOL data by either gender or performance status alone may not accurately reflect how these factors depend upon each another. Understanding the interaction between gender and performance status could lead to better prognosticators and potentially could tailor interventions for specific groups of patients with lung cancer."Lung	Management	"Because quitting smoking is clearly linked to preventing health problems such as lung cancer, research on health message framing based on prospect theory suggests that gain-framed messages (i.e., emphasizing the benefits of quitting smoking) would be more persuasive in promoting cessation than loss-framed messages (i.e., emphasizing the costs of continuing to smoke). However, because women tend to anticipate greater perceived risk from quitting smoking than men, this may affect how receptive they are to specific message framing interventions. Data from 249 participants (129 females, 120 males) in a clinical trial of message framing for smoking cessation with bupropion were used to examine how gender differences in perceptions of the risks associated with quitting influence the effects of framed interventions using number of days to smoking relapse as the criterion. Perceived risk of quitting scores were dichotomized using a median split for the entire sample. Women reported a higher perceived risk of cessation than men. Participants who anticipated high risks associated with quitting smoking reported fewer days to relapse. Further, females in the gain-framed condition who reported low perceived risks of cessation had a greater number of days to relapse, as opposed to females in the loss-framed condition. These findings suggest that message framing interventions for smoking cessation should consider the influence of gender and risk perceptions associated with quitting on the effectiveness of framed interventions."Lung	Clinical	"Because quitting smoking is clearly linked to preventing health problems such as lung cancer, research on health message framing based on prospect theory suggests that gain-framed messages (i.e., emphasizing the benefits of quitting smoking) would be more persuasive in promoting cessation than loss-framed messages (i.e., emphasizing the costs of continuing to smoke).

Global and truncated (35 to 64 years) age-specific and gender-specific mortality rates were calculated and expressed as rates per 100,000 person-years. Trends were analyzed using joinpoint regression models.In 2005 in Spain, 16 647 men and 2471 women died from lung cancer, accounting for 26.6% and 6.6%, respectively, of all cancer deaths. In men, truncated mortality rates initially increased in the 1980-1992 period (3.1% per year; P<.05) but began to decrease in the 1992-2005 period (-0.8% per year, P<.05). Starting in the 1990s, age-specific mortality rates showed a statistically significant decrease in patients aged less than 85 years. For women, after an initial stable period, truncated mortality rates increased significantly from 1992 onward by 6.3% per year. The analysis by age groups showed that the rates increased in all age groups, except for patients aged 25 to 34 years and patients aged 75 to 84 years, in whom they remained stable.While lung cancer mortality began to decrease slightly among Spanish men 15 years ago, it increased significantly among women during the same period."Lung	Review	There is expanding evidence that lung cancer has a multitude of sex differences.

Accurate gene expression signatures are needed to classify patients into high- and low-risk groups to improve the selection of patients for adjuvant therapy.Multiple published microarray data sets were used to evaluate our previously identified lung cancer prognostic gene signature. Expression of the signature genes was further validated with real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot assays of snap-frozen lung cancer tumor tissues.Our previously identified 35-gene signature stratified 264 patients with NSCLC into high- and low-risk groups with distinct overall survival rates (P < 0.05, Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank tests). The 35-gene signature further stratified patients with clinical stage 1A diseases into poor prognostic and good prognostic subgroups (P = 0.0007, Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank tests). This signature is independent of other prognostic factors for NSCLC, including age, sex, tumor differentiation, tumor grade, and tumor stage. The expression of the signature genes was validated with real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of lung cancer tumor specimens. Protein expression of two signature genes, TAL2 and ILF3, was confirmed in lung adenocarcinoma tumors by using Western blot analysis. These two biomarkers showed correlated mRNA and protein overexpression in lung cancer development and progression.The results indicate that the identified 35-gene signature is an accurate predictor of survival in NSCLC. It provides independent prognostic information in addition to traditional clinicopathologic criteria."Lung	Outcomes	"The aim of this study is to compare the prevalence and intensity of symptoms and problems with functioning between women and men with inoperable lung cancer (LC) during 3 months post-diagnosis. One hundred and fifty-nine patients completed the EORTC QLQ C-30+LC13 at three time points: close to diagnosis and prior to treatment, and one, and 3 months later. Descriptive cross-sectional analyses and longitudinal analyses using repeated measure ANOVA were conducted. These patients reported many and intense symptoms and problems with functioning. The most salient finding from the cross-sectional analysis was that women reported both more, and more intense problems with emotional functioning close to diagnosis. Statistically significant improvements over time were found in both men and women with regard to emotional functioning, dyspnea, insomnia, cough, pain in arm/shoulder, while physical functioning, fatigue, constipation, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy and alopecia deteriorated significantly over time. The longitudinal analyses suggest that, with the exception of emotional functioning, gender differences were not only related to biological sex alone, but were also found to be related to other components of the patients' life situation, such as education, age, civil status and type of LC. Sensitivity to different symptom experiences and responses to those experiences between and within women and men is also necessary in the management of symptoms in patients with inoperable LC."Lung	Outcomes	"The aim of this study is to compare the prevalence and intensity of symptoms and problems with functioning between women and men with inoperable lung cancer (LC) during 3 months post-diagnosis.

The MDM2 protein is a key inhibitor of p53 and several mechanisms of MDM2/p53 interactions are presently known: modulating DNA-repair, cell-cycle control, cell growth and apoptosis.We used 635 Caucasian patients diagnosed with lung cancer before 51 years of age and 1300 healthy gender and age frequency matched population Caucasian controls to investigate the association between the MDM2 SNP309 and the risk of developing early onset lung cancer. Conditional logistic models were applied to assess the genotype-phenotype association, adjusted for smoking. Compared to the GG genotype, the adjusted ORs for the TG and TT genotype were 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7-1.5) and 1.0 (95% CI: 0.7-1.5), respectively. Also no association was found for histological subtypes of lung cancer. The strength of this study is that within young cases the genetic component to develop lung cancer may be greater. Our results indicate that the MDM2 SNP309 is not significantly associated with lung carcinogenesis but point towards gender-specific differences."Lung	Management	"It was the aim of this study to investigate gender differences in the outcomes of carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with unresectable stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Gender, age, performance status, histology, hematological toxicity, tumor responses and survival parameters obtained retrospectively by medical chart review were analyzed.A total of 227 patients (147 males and 80 females) were included. The median lowest leukocyte count was 2,900 (range 1,200-12,400)/microl in males and 2,200 (range 600-6,500)/microl in females (p < 0.001). Grade 3-4 leukopenia was noted in 15% of male and in 39% of female patients (p < 0.001). In both genders, the response rate in evaluable patients was 39%. The median progression-free survival was 4.4 months for men and 5.3 months for women (p = 0.0081). After progression of the disease, gefitinib was administered in 64 (44%) male and 45 (56%) female patients, with a median treatment of 35 and 144 days, respectively. The median survival time was 11.9 months for men and 22.2 months for women (p < 0.001).Female gender was associated with a favorable prognosis in patients with NSCLC who received carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy, although the response rates did not differ between the genders. Of note, hematological toxicity was more severe in female patients."Lung	Pathophysiology	"In nonsmall cell lung cancer, tumor parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) expression predicts longer survival in women but not in men. To explain the sex-dependent survival effect, the authors proposed that hormonal influences decrease PTHrP in men versus women, that PTHrP inhibits tumor growth, and that the effect is greater in women than in men. The objectives of this study were to compare lung carcinoma PTHrP expression and carcinoma growth in male and female mice and to determine whether gonadal steroids regulate PTHrP in lung cancer cells.Tumor PTHrP content was measured by immunoassay, and tumor burden was assessed with multiple measures in BEN squamous cell orthotopic lung carcinomas in athymic mice. In addition, lung adenocarcinoma PTHrP messenger RNA (mRNA) values determined by microarray analyses were compared between men and women. Cultured lung cancer cells were assayed for PTHrP after treatment with estradiol or R1881, a synthetic androgen.Lung carcinomas contained approximately 3 times more PTHrP in female mice than in male mice. Similarly, levels of PTHrP mRNA were significantly greater in adenocarcinomas from patients who were women than from patients who were men. Male mice had greater tumor burden than female mice. Androgen treatment reduced PTHrP in 3 lung cancer lines. Estradiol had no effect. Testosterone treatment also reduced lung carcinoma PTHrP in female mice.Lung carcinomas in females expressed more PTHrP than in males possibly because of negative regulation by androgens in males. Female mice with higher tumor PTHrP content had significantly less tumor burden than male mice, supporting the hypothesis that PTHrP inhibits tumor growth."Lung	Pathophysiology	"In nonsmall cell lung cancer, tumor parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) expression predicts longer survival in women but not in men.

The design of better therapies for lung cancer patients would be greatly aided by good mouse models that closely resemble the human disease. Unfortunately, current models for lung adenocarcinoma are inadequate due to the absence of metastases. In this study, we incorporated both K-ras and p53 missense mutations into the mouse genome and established a more faithful genetic model for human lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of lung cancer. Mice with both mutations developed advanced lung adenocarcinomas that were highly aggressive and metastasized to multiple intrathoracic and extrathoracic sites in a pattern similar to that of human lung cancer. These mice also showed a gender difference in cancer-related death. Additionally, the presence of both mutations induced pleural mesotheliomas in 23% of these mice. This mouse model recapitulates the metastatic nature of human lung cancer and will be invaluable to further probe the molecular basis of metastatic lung cancer and for translational studies."Lung	Outcomes	"To describe the temporal trend in and spatial distribution of mortality from tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer in Brazil from 1979 to 2004.Mortality data by gender and geographic region were obtained from the Mortality Database created by the Ministry of Health in 1975. Demographic data were collected from the national censuses, from population counts, and from population estimates made in non-census years. Mortality rates were standardized according to the direct method, and the trends were analyzed by gender and geographic region using the Prais-Winsten method for generalized linear regression.Lung cancer mortality accounted for approximately 12% of the overall neoplasia-related mortality during the period. There was a trend toward an increase for both genders and in all regions, except for the male population in the southeast region, whose rates remained steady between 1979 and 2004. The highest rates were observed in the south and southeast regions. However, the northeast region was the one that presented the greatest increase, followed by the central-west and north regions. In all regions, the increase in mortality rates was higher in women.The increase in lung cancer mortality in Brazil between 1979 and 2004 requires public measures that can minimize exposition to risk factors, mainly tobacco, and allow greater access to health care facilities for diagnosis and treatment."Lung	Outcomes	"To describe the temporal trend in and spatial distribution of mortality from tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer in Brazil from 1979 to 2004.Mortality data by gender and geographic region were obtained from the Mortality Database created by the Ministry of Health in 1975.

Whether this results from better response to treatment, different tumor biology, or a longer life expectancy is not well understood. This study sought to assess sex differences in the natural history of lung cancer after controlling for unrelated causes of death and type of treatment.This study included 18,967 elderly patients with stage I and II non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed between 1991 and 1999 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry linked to Medicare records. Patients were grouped into three categories according to the treatment received: surgery, radiation or chemotherapy but no surgery, and untreated cases. We used stratified and multivariate analyses to evaluate sex differences in survival using three methods to control for competing risks: lung cancer-specific survival, overall survival adjusting for comorbidities, and relative survival. Sensitivity analysis was used to test whether potential differences in smoking could account for the observed association of sex with survival.Women in all treatment groups had better lung cancer-specific, overall, and relative survival than did men (P < .0001). Stratified and multivariate analyses showed that women had better survival than did men after controlling for confounders. Sensitivity analyses showed that potential sex differences in smoking did not explain our findings.In this national, population-based sample, elderly women with early lung cancer had better risk-adjusted survival regardless of the type of treatment. That sex differences were observed among untreated patients suggests that lung cancer in women may have a different natural history."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Epidemiological studies indicated that people exposed to dioxins were prone to the development of lung diseases including lung cancer. Animal studies demonstrated that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) increased liver tumors and promoted lung metaplasia in females. Metabolic changes in 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) resulted from an interaction between TCDD and E(2) could be associated with gender difference. Previously, we reported that methoxylestradiols (MeOE(2)), especially 4-MeOE(2), accumulated in human lung cells (BEAS-2B) co-treated with TCDD and E(2). In the present study, we demonstrate unique accumulation of 4-MeOE(2), as a result of TCDD/E(2) interaction and revealed its bioactivity in human lung epithelial cell line (H1355). 4-Methoxyestradiol treatment significantly decreased cell growth and increased mitotic index. Elevation of ROS and SOD activity, with a concomitant decrease in the intracellular GSH/GSSG ratio, was also detected in 4-MeOE(2)-treated cells. Quantitative comet assay showed increased oxidative DNA damage in the 4-MeOE(2)-treated H1355 cells, which could be significantly reduced by the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). However, inhibition of cell growth and increase in mitotic arrest induced by 4-MeOE(2) were unaffected by NAC. We concluded that 4-MeOE(2) accumulation resulting from TCDD and E(2) interaction would contribute to the higher vulnerability on lung pathogenesis in females when exposed to TCDD."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Epidemiological studies indicated that people exposed to dioxins were prone to the development of lung diseases including lung cancer.

To elucidate the association between somatic mutations and the pharmacological actions of gefitinib, the chemosensitivity of isolated cancer cells from the lungs of Japanese patients to gefitinib was examined by the collagen gel-droplet embedded culture drug sensitivity test in vitro. In 30 specimens isolated from non-small-cell lung cancer patients, mutations were observed in eight tumour specimens (27%) and chemosensitivity to gefitinib was observed in seven specimens (23%). However, somatic mutations were not predominantly associated with chemosensitivity to gefitinib in vitro. Both mutation and chemosensitivity frequencies in this study were higher than those reported in studies from the United States, indicating a possible ethnic difference. Moreover, both frequencies were much higher in females than in males. Since a gender difference in chemosensitivity to gefitinib was observed in isolated cancer cells in vitro, this suggests that gefitinib works in part through the suppression of EGFR signalling, but that other factors, including sex-related factors, may participate in gefitinib action."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with clinical responsiveness of lung cancer to gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

Smoking topography data indicated that, compared with men, women took smaller puffs (37.6 ml/puff vs. 45.8 ml/puff; p = .0001) of shorter duration (1.33 s/puff vs. 1.48 s/puff; p = .002) but drew more puffs per cigarette (13.5 vs. 12.0; p = .001) and left longer butts (36.3 mm or 40.2% of cigarette length vs. 34.3 mm or 39.2% of cigarette length; p = .01). These trends were similar in both African Americans and European Americans. The emissions of select toxins per cigarette, as determined by mimicking human smoking behaviors were greater among the male smokers than the female smokers and correlated significantly with delivered smoke volume per cigarette. The geometric means of emissions of nicotine from cigarettes were 1.92 mg/cigarette (95% CI = 1.80-2.05) for women versus 2.20 (95% CI = 2.04-2.37) for men (p = .005). Cigarettes smoked by women yielded 139.5 ng/cigarette of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK; 95% CI = 128.8-151.0), compared with 170.3 ng/cigarette (95% CI = 156.3-185.6) for men (p = .0007); benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) emissions were 18.0 ng/cigarette (95% CI = 17.0-19.0) for women and 20.5 ng/cigarette (95% CI = 18.8-22.3) for men (p = .01). The gender differences with regard to cigarette smoke yields of toxins were more profound in European Americans than in African Americans. On average, African American men's smoking habits produced the highest emissions of select toxins from cigarettes, and European American female smokers had the lowest exposure to carcinogens and toxins. Several studies have suggested that women may be more susceptible than men to the ill effects of carcinogens in tobacco and tobacco smoke, whereas other studies have not found differences in lung cancer risk between men and women. The present study suggests that gender differences in exposure to tobacco smoke cannot account for a higher rate of lung cancer in female smokers compared with male smokers."Lung	Outcomes	"Vitamin D derivatives can modulate proliferation and differentiation of cancer cells. Our main source of Vitamin D is ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced synthesis in skin following sun exposure. UV measurements show that the ambient annual UV exposures increase by about 50% from north to south in Norway. As judged from the incidence rates of squamous cell carcinoma, the same is true for the average personal UV exposures. Solar ultraviolet B (UVB) (280-320nm) exhibits a strong seasonal variation with a minimum during the winter months. The present work aims at investigating the impact of season of diagnosis and residential region, both influencing the Vitamin D level, on the risk of death from lung cancer in patients diagnosed in Norway. Data on all incident cases of lung cancer between 1964 and 2000 were collected. Risk estimates were calculated as relative risk (RR), with 95% confidence intervals using Cox regression model. The seasonal variation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was assessed from routine measurements of 15,616 samples performed at The Hormone Laboratory of Aker University Hospital. Our results indicate that season of diagnosis is of prognostic value for lung cancer patients, with a approximately 15% lower case fatality for young male patients diagnosed during autumn versus winter (RR=0.85; 95% CI, -0.73 to 0.99; p=0.04). Residing in a high UV region resulted in a further lowering of the death risk than residing in a low UV region. We propose, in agreement with earlier findings for prostate-, breast- colon cancer and Hodgkins lymphoma, that a high level of sun-induced 25-hydroxyvitamin D can be a prognostic advantage for certain groups of lung cancer patients, notably for young men. Lung cancer has for several decades been the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men in Norway and during the last two decades, became the second most common cause of cancer-related death in women . There are two main types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer for which chemotherapy is the primary treatment and non-small cell lung cancer, which in its early stages is treated primarily with surgery. Gender-related differences have been described in the literature with respect to survival after therapy, male gender being a significant independent negative prognostic factor . In Norway the 5 years relative survival for localized tumours is about 30% for females and 20% for males. Calcitriol, which is the most active form of Vitamin D, is involved in key regulatory processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in a wide variety of cells . Mechanisms for these actions have been proposed to be the interaction of active Vitamin D derivatives with a specific nuclear receptor (VDR receptor) and/or with membrane targets . In vitro studies, performed with lung cancer cell lines, have shown an inhibitive effect of Vitamin D derivatives on cell-growth and proliferation . Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated the capability of these compounds to suppress invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis in vivo , suggesting that administration of Vitamin D derivatives may be used as adjuvant therapy for lung cancer. Humans get optimal Vitamin D levels by exposure to sun or artificial ultraviolet B (UVB, 280-320nm) sources , and possibly also by consumption of food rich in this nutrient (fat fish, eggs, margarine, etc.) or of vitamin supplements . Among these sources, solar radiation appears to be the most important one . Thus, the Vitamin D status (assessed by the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcidiol) exhibits a strong seasonal variation that parallels the seasonal change in the fluence of solar UVB that reaches the ground. During winter, the UVB fluence rate in the Nordic countries (50-71 degrees N) is below the level required for Vitamin D synthesis in skin . The maximal level of calcidiol is reached between the months July and September, and is 20-120% higher than the corresponding winter level . Recently we hypothesised that the seasonal variation of calcidiol might be of prognostic significance for colon-, breast- prostate cancer as well as for Hodgkins lymphoma in Norway. Patients diagnosed during summer and autumn have a better survival after standard treatment than patients diagnosed during the winter season . This might be a consequence of a higher Vitamin D level. An American study investigated the effect of season of surgery and recent Vitamin D intake on the survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients. The authors reported a significant beneficial joint effect of summer season and high Vitamin D intake compared with winter season and low Vitamin D intake while Vitamin D intake alone did not affect prognosis. Similar results were recently reported from a large study in United Kingdom involving over a million cancer patients including over 190,000 patients diagnosed with lung cancer . Norway (58-71 degrees N) has a significant north-south variation in UV fluence. This makes the country suitable for studies relating cancer epidemiology to UV levels . We investigated whether variations in UV, and, consequently, in Vitamin D level, influence the prognosis of lung cancer, using season of diagnosis and residential regions as variables. Survival data obtained for patients diagnosed over a 40 years period were compared with variations in serum Vitamin D levels obtained from routine measurements performed in The Hormone Laboratory of Aker University Hospital during the period 1996-2001. Seasonal and gender variations in Vitamin D level have been estimated from the analyses."Lung	Epidemiology	"Vitamin D derivatives can modulate proliferation and differentiation of cancer cells.

In the present study, we assumed the existence of shared candidate genes that are common in lung and breast cancers, and examined whether women with a family history of breast cancer are at increased risk of lung cancer compared with men, especially adenocarcinoma, in a case-only study.This case-only study was conducted based on the Lung Cancer Database Project at the National Cancer Center Hospital East. A total of 1566 patients with newly diagnosed primary lung cancer were consecutively recruited between 1999 and 2003. Information on their family history of cancer and smoking habit was obtained from a self-administered questionnaire. To assess an interactions between two factors, odds ratios for interaction (ORis) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by case-only contingency table.A statistically significant ORi was observed between a family history of breast cancer in first-degree relatives (parent and siblings, not including children) and the sex of a patient (ORi: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.02-4.81). A stratified analysis by histologic subtypes showed a statistically significant ORi only for adenocarcinoma (ORi: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.19-8.98). No other family history of cancer, such as stomach, colon and lung cancer, showed a statistically significant ORi.This study suggests the possibility of gene-sex interaction in lung cancer."Lung	Epidemiology	"The literature suggests that lung cancer may represent a different disease in women compared with men and that gender specificities have been reported mostly in clinical trials patients.We conducted a retrospective, population-based study of a sample of 1738 patients diagnosed with a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the department of Bas-Rhin (northeastern France) between 1982 and 1997. Our study aimed to describe symptoms at presentation, stage, histological distribution, treatment modalities, and survival, according to sex.Tobacco exposure differed significantly according to sex: 28.9% of women were nonsmokers versus 1.4% of the men. More NSCLC were metastatic at diagnosis in women than in men (41.1% versus 29.9%). Adenocarcinoma predominated in women (54.4%), whereas squamous cell carcinoma predominated in men (65.9%). Invasive procedures, such as transthoracic needle biopsy, contributed more frequently to histological diagnosis in women. Men and women underwent the same procedures for disease staging, excepted for the abdominal computed tomography scan, which was performed more frequently in women. Treatment also differed: in resectable disease, fewer pneumonectomies were performed in women; in locally advanced disease, the mean doses of thoracic irradiation were significantly lower in women (48.0 grays versus 55.5 grays); in metastatic-stage disease, fewer women received platin-based chemotherapy, but this difference was not significant. Sex was not a significant prognostic factor in our study, contrary to most North American studies, where women seem to have had better survival rates.This study emphasizes gender differences in smoking exposure, presentation (stage, histological subtype), and diagnostic and therapeutic management of NSCLC."Lung	Epidemiology	"The literature suggests that lung cancer may represent a different disease in women compared with men and that gender specificities have been reported mostly in clinical trials patients.We conducted a retrospective, population-based study of a sample of 1738 patients diagnosed with a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the department of Bas-Rhin (northeastern France) between 1982 and 1997.

Although some of this disturbing trend in women can be attributed to changing smoking habits, there is emerging evidence that women may be biologically more susceptible to the harmful effects of cigarette smoke than are men. Estrogen and related compounds may up-regulate the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in lungs and liver, which are involved in the metabolism of various constituents of cigarette smoke. Although metabolism of foreign substances is usually beneficial in eliminating potential toxins from the body, in some instances the metabolic process can transform harmless substances into toxic chemicals through a process called metabolic bioactivation. One important xenobiotic substrate for CYP enzymes in cigarette smoke is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which in its native form is relatively harmless in small doses but upon bioactivation by CYP enzymes, can become very toxic substances for the lungs. In this article, we explore CYP and other related pathways as potential mechanisms and targets of future research and novel discoveries to curb the growing epidemic of COPD and lung cancer in women."Lung	Review	"Smoking-related lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer are growing epidemics in women in the United States and elsewhere.

Environmental carcinogens, particularly tobacco smoke, play a dominant role in the development of lung cancer, although 10-15% of all patients diagnosed are non-smokers. In addition, emerging data demonstrate sex-specific differences in lung cancer susceptibility and prognosis. This implies that the development of lung cancer is modulated by complex interactions between genetic, hormonal, behavioral, and environmental factors. A better understanding of the differences between men and women and their impact on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer requires continued basic and clinical research. Recent data on the epidemiological aspects of lung cancer in women, lung tumor biology, and emerging trends in clinical research were presented at a thought leaders' roundtable hosted by the Society for Women's Health Research. The panel concluded that as the patient population in lung cancer is changing from mostly male smokers to include women and non-smokers, an urgent need exists to increase awareness and research funding to improve lung cancer care, particularly in women. To further improve survival in this disease, both clinical characteristics and tumor biology should be considered in the development of new treatment options."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Epidemiological studies indicate that there is a gender difference in the susceptibility to tobacco and environmental carcinogens, and this gender difference is suspected to result in a higher risk for lung cancer among women. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain unclear. In the present study, we have evaluated the roles of CYP1A1 and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DDH) in the formation of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) DNA adducts in various lung cancer cell lines. Among six lung cancer cell lines tested, higher adduct levels were observed in CL-3 and CL1-1 cells, which had relatively high expression of both CYP1A1 and DDH isoform 1 (DHH1). To determine whether a reduction in DDH expression changed the adduct levels, an siRNA was used to knock down DDH1 expression in CL-3 cells. The BaP adduct levels in siDDH-CL-3 cells increased 1.4-2.2-fold relative to that of the parental CL-3 cells. We also examined BaP-like DNA adducts, and CYP1A1 and DDH1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 120 lung tumors. Detection of DNA adducts correlated with CYP1A1-positive tumors (P = 0.023), but not with DDH1-positive tumors. In addition, 28 of 33 tumors (85%) that were CYP1A1-positive and DDH1-negative contained detectable levels of DNA adducts, a proportion that was higher than for tumors from the other three categories of CYP1A1 and DDH1 expression (P = 0.012). Finally, a greater proportion of adduct-positive tumors from females were CYP1A1-positive/DDH1-negative (45.3%) than were tumors from males (27.3%). These results suggest that the reduction of DDH expression in lung tumors may contribute to an increase in DNA adduct levels, which may be partly responsible for the higher susceptibility of female lung cancer patients to DNA damage."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Epidemiological studies indicate that there is a gender difference in the susceptibility to tobacco and environmental carcinogens, and this gender difference is suspected to result in a higher risk for lung cancer among women.

Recently, a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential has been noted in some countries. In Canada, between 1981 and 2000, this differential narrowed by almost two years. Greater than expected improvements in male death rates with respect to heart disease, lung cancer, accidents and violence (excluding suicide) explain a large part of this phenomenon. Change in male and female smoking prevalence correlates strongly with change in sex differences in mortality from heart disease and cancer. The reasons underlying men's greater mortality improvements in regard to accidents and violence are less clear and need further investigation."Lung	Epidemiology	"A retrospective study including all patients with non-small cell lung cancer carcinoma in a population-based registry was performed to characterize gender differences in lung cancer and to analyze the factors influencing prognosis in women.We retrieved through the Tuscan Cancer Registry (RTT) archive 2,523 lung tumor cases diagnosed during the period 1996-1998 in the provinces of Florence and Prato, central Italy. We compared the prognosis within 464 non-small lung cancer women and 1,798 men in a population-based case series. The influence of the following variables on postoperative survival were analyzed: age, cell type, pathologic T and N status, site of tumor and type of surgical resection.The age at diagnosis was similar in women and in men. Women were significantly more likely to have adenocarcinoma but less likely to have squamous cell carcinoma compared with men. Fewer pneumonectomies were performed in women than in men. Nevertheless, prognosis was similar in both sexes and type of surgical resection was significant prognostic factor.Lung cancer was more frequent in men than in women, but overall survival is similar. Differences in lung cancer histology and rate of pneumonectomies were found between men and women."Lung	Epidemiology	"A retrospective study including all patients with non-small cell lung cancer carcinoma in a population-based registry was performed to characterize gender differences in lung cancer and to analyze the factors influencing prognosis in women.We retrieved through the Tuscan Cancer Registry (RTT) archive 2,523 lung tumor cases diagnosed during the period 1996-1998 in the provinces of Florence and Prato, central Italy.

The incidence of adenocarcinoma was significantly higher in the women. The proportion of stage IA disease was significantly higher in the women than in the men (45% vs 29%, respectively). The 5-year overall survival rates were 50% in the men and 63% in the women. In a multivariate analysis, gender difference was an independent prognostic factor; however, when death as a result of unrelated disease was excluded, there was no significant difference in prognosis.Although the higher incidences of adenocarcinoma and stage IA cancer contributed to the good results of surgery in women, the low incidence of death attributed to diseases other than lung cancer was a major reason for their better prognosis."Lung	Epidemiology	"There are gender differences in multiple primary malignancies associated with lung cancer (MPMLC) in terms of clinical characteristics. However, the importance of these differences in the management of patients has not been clarified.Differences in characteristics affected by gender were investigated in MPMLC to identify factors important for the proper management of the patients.Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed between 82 male and 34 female patients with MPMLC treated from August 1982 to March 2002.In univariate analysis, the numbers of smokers or ex-smokers, smoking-related cancer and synchronous multiple primary malignancies were significantly increased in males with MPMLC (p < 0.0001, p < 0.05 and p < 0.05, respectively). In multivariate analysis, synchronous multiple primary malignancies and the number of smokers or ex-smokers were significantly different between male and female MPMLC. Gastric, lung and colon cancers were major constituents in male MPMLC, and 40.2% of all malignancies were smoking-related cancers. On the other hand, breast and uterine cancers were major constituents in female MPMLC, and only 20.6% of all MPMLC were smoking-related cancers.Male patients with MPMLC demonstrated significant smoking history and synchronous multiple primary malignancies, indicating the need for different approaches to properly manage and follow up male versus female MPMLC patients."Lung	Outcomes	"The sex ratio of mortality has important social implications but is only rarely considered. Women have lower mortality rates than men. The sex ratio of mortality is cause-specific and differs markedly between populations. Assuming that the genetic differences between the sexes are very similar between populations implies that the differences in the sex ratio cannot be explained by genetic factors. Gender differences in smoking levels exert a strong influence on the sex ratio of lung cancer, total cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The sex ratio of mortality decreases with age. The mortality rates between the genders are highly significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) both at younger and older age classes, except for lung cancer in the 45-74 y age class. This demonstrates that identical factors influence the mortality rates of both genders, but at a lower level in women."Lung	Outcomes	"The aim of the present paper was to analyse cancer mortality in the Umbria region, from 1978 to 2004. Mortality trends depend on a number of factors including exposures, health system interventions, and possibly artefact (e.g. classification change, variations of data completeness). Descriptive data on mortality only allow for generation of hypotheses to explain observed trends. Some clues on the respective role of possible mortality determinants may be found comparing mortality with incidence and survival data.Mortality data for the periods 1978-1993 and 1994-2004 were supplied by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and the Regional Causes of Death Registry (ReNCaM) respectively. Sex and site-specific mortality time trends were analysed by the ""joinpoint regression"" method.For all sites combined, in both sexes, the standardised rate was first increasing before the end of the eighties and decreasing thereafter. Gastric cancer mortality showed a different trend by gender; that is the rate constantly decreased over the period among females while, for males, it was first increasing up to 1985 and decreasing thereafter. Liver cancer trend showed a pattern similar to gastric cancer. Large bowel cancer showed a gender specific trend, that is it was increasing among males and stable among females. Also lung cancer mortality varied by gender: it started to decline after 1989 among males but was steadily increasing over the study period among women. A decreasing trend for female breast cancer mortality began in 1994. Prostate cancer mortality trend is the only one showing two significant joinpoints: mortality decreased up to 1990, then it increased up to 1998 and, finally, was decreasing.Overall cancer mortality was decreasing in both sexes in Umbria and this favourable trend will probably continue and further improve since population screening against breast, cervix, and large bowel cancers were recently introduced. Besides gastric cancer, tobacco-related cancers and prostate cancer mainly contributed to mortality reduction in males, whereas breast cancer mainly contributed to declining mortality in females."Lung		"There are gender differences in multiple primary malignancies associated with lung cancer (MPMLC) in terms of clinical characteristics.

In multivariate analysis, synchronous multiple primary malignancies and the number of smokers or ex-smokers were significantly different between male and female MPMLC. Gastric, lung and colon cancers were major constituents in male MPMLC, and 40.2% of all malignancies were smoking-related cancers. On the other hand, breast and uterine cancers were major constituents in female MPMLC, and only 20.6% of all MPMLC were smoking-related cancers.Male patients with MPMLC demonstrated significant smoking history and synchronous multiple primary malignancies, indicating the need for different approaches to properly manage and follow up male versus female MPMLC patients."Lung	Clinical	"We studied the effects of gender difference on the incidence of lung cancer and its mortality rate, which is a subject of much discussion.We examined gender difference in the clinical features of 491 men and 222 women who underwent resection of primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between 1994 and 2004.The histological types of cancer were adenocarcinoma in 249 (51%) of the men and 182 (82%) of the women, and squamous cell carcinoma in 182 (37%) of the men and 27 (12%) of the women. The incidence of adenocarcinoma was significantly higher in the women. The proportion of stage IA disease was significantly higher in the women than in the men (45% vs 29%, respectively). The 5-year overall survival rates were 50% in the men and 63% in the women. In a multivariate analysis, gender difference was an independent prognostic factor; however, when death as a result of unrelated disease was excluded, there was no significant difference in prognosis.Although the higher incidences of adenocarcinoma and stage IA cancer contributed to the good results of surgery in women, the low incidence of death attributed to diseases other than lung cancer was a major reason for their better prognosis."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Although clinical differences in lung cancer between men and women have been noted, few studies have examined the sex dissimilarity using gene expression analysis.The purpose of this study was to determine the different molecular carcinogenic mechanisms involved in lung cancers in Japanese men and women.Patients who received surgery for stage I lung adenocarcinoma were included. RNA was extracted from cancerous and normal tissue, and gene expression was then examined with oligonucleotide microarray analysis. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was performed.In a microarray analysis of tissue from 13 men and 6 women, 12 genes were under-expressed and 24 genes were overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma in women compared with men. Genes related to cell cycle were present in underexpressed genes, and genes related to apoptosis, ubiquitination, and metabolism were observed in overexpressed genes. Of interest among the selected genes were WAP four-disulfide core domain 2 (WFDC2) and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DM alpha (HLA-DMA); these genes were classified into 2 groups by hierarchical clustering analysis. Expression of WFDC2 in nonsmokers was significantly higher than that in smokers (P=0.023). However, there was no significant difference in HLA-DMA expression between smokers and nonsmokers.Thirty-six genes that characterize lung adenocarcinoma by sex were selected. This information may contribute to the development of novel diagnostic techniques and treatment modalities that consider sex differences in lung adenocarcinoma."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Although clinical differences in lung cancer between men and women have been noted, few studies have examined the sex dissimilarity using gene expression analysis.The purpose of this study was to determine the different molecular carcinogenic mechanisms involved in lung cancers in Japanese men and women.Patients who received surgery for stage I lung adenocarcinoma were included.

This study was conducted to determine the contribution of specific causes of death to the sex difference in years of potential life lost (YPLL).The authors examined data from the National Health Interview Survey with linked mortality data through 1997. Using survival analysis estimates, a stochastic simulation model to simulate death events for cohorts of white, African American, and Latino adults was created.YPLL from all causes were greater among men than women. Homicide, motor vehicle accidents, and suicide accounted for 33% of YPLL sex difference among whites, 36% among African Americans, and 52% among Latinos. For all three racial/ethnic groups, cardiovascular disease (principally ischemic heart disease) was the second largest contributor to the sex difference in YPLL (29% among whites, 23% among African Americans, and 25% among Latinos). Lung cancer was also important among whites and African Americans, accounting for 15% and 17% of the sex difference in YPLL from all causes, respectively.Ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, and traumatic deaths account for as much as three-quarters of the excess YPLL among men, suggesting that a few modifiable behaviors such as the use of tobacco, alcohol."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Several studies have reported that female smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer than male smokers. This could be related to sex differences in nicotine metabolism and related smoking behavior. This study tested the hypothesis that women metabolize nicotine more rapidly than men and that, among women, oral contraceptive users metabolize nicotine more rapidly than nonusers of oral contraceptives.Two hundred seventy-eight healthy volunteers who were twins and 16 who were siblings of twins, recruited from the Northern California Twin Registry, received an infusion of deuterium-labeled nicotine and cotinine with frequent blood sampling. The plasma clearances of nicotine and cotinine, the clearance of nicotine to cotinine (an index of cytochrome P450 [CYP] 2A6 activity), and the ratio of trans-3'-hydroxycotinine to cotinine (another indicator of CYP2A6 activity) were measured.The clearances of nicotine and cotinine, the clearance of nicotine to cotinine, and the trans-3'-hydroxycotinine/cotinine ratio were significantly higher in women than in men (nicotine clearance, 15.6 +/- 4.3 mL.min(-1).kg(-1) in men versus 18.8 +/- 6.6 mL.min(-1).kg(-1) in women; P < .001); they were also higher among women taking oral contraceptives than in those who were not taking oral contraceptives (nicotine clearance, 22.5 +/- 6.6 mL.min(-1).kg(-1) in women taking oral contraceptives versus 17.6 +/- 6.1 mL.min(-1).kg(-1) in those who were not; P < .05). Women who were menopausal or postmenopausal were not different from men. Among oral contraceptive users, nicotine metabolism was accelerated among those taking combined and estrogen-only contraceptives but not progesterone-only contraceptives.Sex hormones influence nicotine metabolism. Nicotine and cotinine metabolism is faster in women than in men and is faster in women taking oral contraceptives compared with those who are not. Accelerated nicotine metabolism appears to be a result of estrogen. Sex-related differences in nicotine clearance could affect smoking behaviors, as well as response to nicotine medications, and could be a marker for altered metabolism of nicotine-derived carcinogens."Lung	Epidemiology	"COPD is a well-known independent risk factor that is associated with primary lung cancer. There is, however, a striking paucity of women in studies demonstrating this association. The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence of COPD as determined by pulmonary function tests (PFTs) between women and men at around the time of lung cancer diagnosis.We retrospectively reviewed patients with newly diagnosed primary lung cancer who had undergone PFTs prior to their treatment. The diagnosis of airflow obstruction was made according to American Thoracic Society guidelines. Comparisons of the prevalence of COPD between men and women were performed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.Of the 294 patients in the study, 151 patients (51.4%) were men and 143 patient (48.6%) were women. Of the men, 110 patients (72.8%) had COPD compared with 75 patients (52.5%) among the women. This represented a significantly lower prevalence of COPD in women than in men (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.67; p = 0.0003). When adjusted for age and smoking status, a sustained lower prevalence of COPD was noted in women compared to men (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.74; p = 0.002). In a subset of 256 smokers, there remained a lower prevalence of COPD in women compared to men (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.77; p = 0.003). Adjusted analysis to control for age and number of pack-years of smoking in this subset again showed a sustained reduction in the OR for women presenting with COPD (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.83; p = 0.009).When COPD was examined as an end point among patients who had newly diagnosed lung cancer, a significantly higher proportion of women had normal PFT results. Gender-based differences on PFT results should be considered during the screening of lung cancer, because the stratification of high-risk patients based on the presence of COPD may miss a significant proportion of women with lung cancer."Lung	Clinical	"COPD is a well-known independent risk factor that is associated with primary lung cancer.

For those causes showing a statistically significant increase a spatial analysis on a group of municipalities around Massa and Carrara has been carried out.Mortality for all causes, and for 30 specific causes.The study results confirm, for the years 1995-2000, the previous observation (1990-1994) of statistically significant excesses for mortality from all causes (SMR 109), all cancers (SMR 112), respiratory diseases (SMR 126), cirrhosis (SMR 226), liver (SMR 161) and lung cancer (SMR 115) in males. A statistically significant excess for larynx (SMR 158) and pleural cancer (SMR 178) is observed in the years 1995-2000, which was not present in 1990-1994. A mortality excess for cirrhosis is confirmed in females (SMR 158) and a new one emerges for liver cancer (SMR 144). The comparison between mortality data for the periods 1995-2000 and 1990-1994 has shown a statistically significant decrease in mortality for all causes and for several specific causes, a significant increase in liver (CMF males 1.35; CMF females 1.78) and blood cancer mortality is also detected (CMF females 1.44).This study confirms the negative health impact of environmental, occupational exposures in populations living in areas where high-risk factories are located. Adverse health effects are stronger in socially and economically deprived areas, and persist over many years after closing polluting industrial plants. The results of this study point out to the need of health promoting actions aiming at modifying lifestyle risk factors, ameliorating socio-economic conditions, and maintaining a constant control on environment, also through a specific environmental epidemiological surveillance to monitor the impact of reclamation procedures completed or in progress."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Recent studies imply that HER2/neu is a potential prognostic factor in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Whereas considerable evidence indicates sex differences in epidemiologic, hormonal, biologic, and genetic factors in this disease, it has remained unknown whether HER2/neu has a diverse function as a prognostic factor in men and women.We investigated the association between gene expression levels of HER2/neu in the primary tumors of 90 patients with curable resected NSCLC and survival, especially analyzing whether there is a different potential of this molecular factor in its prognostic impact between men and women.High HER2/neu gene expression levels were found in 62 patients (68.9%), and low HER2/neu gene expression levels were found in 28 patients (31.1%). High HER2/neu messenger RNA expression levels were associated with inferior survival (P = 0.09) compared with lower HER2/neu expression. Survival analysis was then carried out separately for men and women in this group of patients. An HER2/neu gene expression cutoff point was identified that separated women, but not men, into good and poor prognostic groups.These findings suggest that HER2/neu as a prognostic factor is strongly sex specific, indicating that it is not useful for men but highly predictive for women."Lung	Pathophysiology	"The higher frequency of lung adenocarcinoma in women smokers than in men smokers suggests a role for gender-dependent factors in the etiology of lung cancer. We evaluated estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta expression and activity in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and normal lung fibroblasts. Full-length ERalpha and ERbeta proteins were expressed in all cell lines with higher ERbeta than ERalpha. Although estradiol (E(2)) binding was similar, E(2) stimulated proliferation only in cells from females, and this response was inhibited by anti-estrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) and ICI 182,780. In contrast, E(2) did not stimulate replication of lung adenocarcinoma cells from males and 4-OHT or ICI did not block cell proliferation. Similarly, transcription of an estrogen response element-driven reporter gene was stimulated by E(2) in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females, but not males. Progesterone receptor (PR) expression was increased by E(2) in two out of five adenocarcinoma cell lines from females, but none from males. E(2) decreased E-cadherin protein expression in some of the cell lines from females, as it did in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, but not in the cell lines from males. Thus, ERalpha and ERbeta expression does not correlate with the effect of ER ligands on cellular activities in lung adenocarcinoma cells. On the other hand, coactivator DRIP205 expression was higher in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females versus males and higher in adenocarcinoma cells than in normal human bronchial epithelial cells. DRIP205 and other ER coregulators may contribute to differences in estrogen responsiveness between lung adenocarcinoma cells in females and males."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma, tends to spread to the pleural cavities. Once an effusion develops, the prognosis is generally dismal. Immunocytochemistry is frequently applied to effusions for diagnostic purposes, but the prognostic value of markers in malignant effusions have thus far attracted less attention. Dakopatts CK 5/6 antibody was applied to ethanol-fixed fresh cytospin preparations from malignant pleural effusions originating from 18 patients (11 men and 7 women) with a previously or later verified non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In three cases, CK5/6 reactivity was found in part of the malignant population, whereas 10 cases showed reactivity in most tumor cells. The lack of reactivity in malignant cells was only seen in five effusions. Females showed significantly lower reactivity rates, with all negative effusions coming from female patients, whereas 9/10 effusions with reactivity in most malignant cells originated from males. CK5/6 reactivity was significantly correlated to survival, with a median survival time of 18 days for patients with CK5/6-negative tumors, and 212 days for those with positive tumors. The strong relationship between CK5/6 reactivity and survival, and the observed gender difference, warrants larger studies aimed at the clinical utility of CK5/6 as a prognostic marker in metastatic NSCLC, the possible functional role of CK5/6 in cell adhesion in advanced NSCLC and its possible hormonal control."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma, tends to spread to the pleural cavities.

A coal power plant is currently under construction. The aim of the study is to evaluate the health of residents in the area, through the analysis of the mortality registry and the hospital discharge records.cause and gender specific indirect Standardized Mortality (1997-2001) and Hospitalization (1997-2000 and 2001-2004) Ratios were computed, with 95% Confidence Intervals, using regional population as reference.mortality and morbidity excesses for cancer were observed, in particular an increased mortality for lung cancer (observed 134, SMR= 120) and for malignant neoplasm of pleura (observed 8, SMR= 516) were detected among men. An increased frequency of hospital admissions for asthma was observed among children aged 0-14 (period 1997-2000: males, observed 73, SHR= 177; females, observed 40, SHR= 157). Finally an significantly increased incidence of renal diseases was recorded by the Lazio Dialysis Registry in the period 2001-2004 (observed 28, SHR= 156).in view of the environmental changes of the area, the excesses observed in this study suggest the need for epidemiologic monitoring found in excess (lung and pleural cancer, respiratory diseases among children, renal diseases) in the area."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer is the most common cancer in both men and women; however, there are some clear gender-based differences. As the incidence of lung cancer is declining in men, the incidence of lung cancer is increasing in women. Women are more likely than men to have adenocarcinoma, a histologic subtype that correlates with worsened prognosis, but women have improved survival compared with men. Genetic predisposition and the presence of estrogen receptors in lung cancer cells may predispose women to developing lung cancer. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism and significance of these findings."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer is the most common cancer in both men and women; however, there are some clear gender-based differences.

Expression of the protein could have implications for progression of the disease because it regulates cancer cell growth, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. However, its relationship with survival has not been evaluated in a large-scale investigation.PTHrP expression was assessed in paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 407 patients with NSCLC by immunohistochemistry. A pathologist unaware of the clinical history classified specimens as PTHrP positive or PTHrP negative. The log-rank test was used to compare survivals of PTHrP-positive and PTHrP-negative groups, and Cox regression was used to adjust for additional covariates.Median survival was 55 versus 22 months (P < 0.001) in female patients with and without tumor PTHrP, respectively. Male survival was 38 months independent of PTHrP status. Stage, histology, age, and smoking history were also associated with increased longevity. PTHrP remained a significant predictor of survival for female patients after controlling for stage, histology, and age.In this study, PTHrP expression was associated with a survival advantage in female patients. Additional investigations must be done to ascertain whether the result is reproducible and independent of potential confounding covariates. Sex-dependent effects of PTHrP in lung cancer would open new avenues of research into the role of sex in cancer progression."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is commonly expressed in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC).

National registry-based studies have shown gender disparity in clinicopathologic characteristics and in survival. This study evaluates the risk factors and trends of lung cancer between genders.A prospective cohort of consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were carefully clinically (all underwent dedicated positron emission tomography scans) and pathologically staged with stage I, II, or III disease underwent homogenous treatment algorithms and were followed up over a period of 7 years. Primary outcomes were 5-year survival and response to neoadjuvant therapy.There were 1,085 patients (671 men and 414 women). Groups were similar for race, pulmonary function, smoking history, comorbidities, neoadjuvant therapy, histology, and resection rates. Women were younger (p = 0.014), had a higher incidence of adenocarcinoma (p = 0.01), and presented at an earlier pathologic stage (p = 0.01) than men. The overall age-adjusted and stage-adjusted 5-year survival rate favored women (60% vs 50%, respectively; p < 0.001). Women had better stage-specific 5-year survival rates (stage I disease, 69% vs 64%, respectively [p = 0.034]; stage II disease, 60% vs 50%, respectively [p = 0.042]; and stage III disease, 46% vs 37%, respectively [p = 0.024]). Women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (n = 76) were more likely to be a complete or partial responder than men (n = 142; p = 0.025).Despite uniform staging and treatment, the 5-year survival rate of women with stage I to III NSCLC was better than men overall and at each stage. Women are more likely to have adenocarcinoma, to present with earlier stage disease, and to be younger. Interestingly, women respond better to neoadjuvant chemotherapy."Lung	Outcomes	"Bronchogenic malignancy is the number one cause of cancer deaths in both men and women worldwide.

Women were younger (p = 0.014), had a higher incidence of adenocarcinoma (p = 0.01), and presented at an earlier pathologic stage (p = 0.01) than men. The overall age-adjusted and stage-adjusted 5-year survival rate favored women (60% vs 50%, respectively; p < 0.001). Women had better stage-specific 5-year survival rates (stage I disease, 69% vs 64%, respectively [p = 0.034]; stage II disease, 60% vs 50%, respectively [p = 0.042]; and stage III disease, 46% vs 37%, respectively [p = 0.024]). Women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (n = 76) were more likely to be a complete or partial responder than men (n = 142; p = 0.025).Despite uniform staging and treatment, the 5-year survival rate of women with stage I to III NSCLC was better than men overall and at each stage. Women are more likely to have adenocarcinoma, to present with earlier stage disease, and to be younger. Interestingly, women respond better to neoadjuvant chemotherapy."Lung	Review	"The risks associated with cigarette smoking can be substantial, particularly for females. In 2000, the mortality rate for lung cancer among women was higher than that for breast cancer.To obtain overall risk for intensity of smoking for both males and females, a meta-analysis was performed on recent studies that assessed the morbidity and mortality associated with smoking.Using the PubMed database, a literature search was conducted for cohort and case-control studies on the effect of smoking on morbidity and mortality. Only studies that had quantified the risk of disease associated with smoking were included. Nineteen studies were selected, with data obtained on the disease affected by smoking, point estimates of risk, 95% CIs, sample size, type of study, and the number of patients of each sex. Meta-analyses were performed for low level of use, defined as 1 to 20 cigarettes per day, and for high level of use, >20 cigarettes per day.For low level of use, the rate ratio point estimate of 1.77 (95% CI, 1.40-2.24) for females was higher than that of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.23-1.64) for males, indicating a gender effect associated with smoking as a disease risk. The point estimate for females who smoked at high levels was 2.75 (95% CI, 2.14-3.52), well beyond the estimate of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.70-2.24) for males, indicating there was a substantial gender effect with high-level use. All point estimates for low and high levels of smoking were significant; those for each sex at high levels of smoking exceeded those found for low levels. The increase in risk from low to high levels of smoking was greater for females than for males.Few systems in the body were unaffected by smoking, and intensity was a risk factor for disease. Results were consistent with and strengthened previous research demonstrating an increase in overall risk with an increase in smoking intensity. In addition, gender differences were noted that may contribute to risk magnitude."Lung	Pathophysiology	"It is controversial whether women have a higher lung cancer susceptibility compared to men. We previously reported higher levels of smoking-related bulky DNA adducts in female lungs. In a pilot study (27 cases), we also found a higher level of female lung cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) gene expression. In the present extended study we report on the pulmonary expression of several genes involved in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bioactivation in relation to sex, smoking and DNA adducts. CYP1A1, CYP1B1, aryl hydrocarbon receptor and microsomal epoxide hydrolase gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR in 121 normal lung tissue samples. The expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 was significantly higher among current smokers compared to ex-smokers and never-smokers. Among current smokers, females had a 3.9-fold higher median level of CYP1A1 compared to males (p = 0.011). CYP1B1 expression was not related to sex. Lung DNA adducts (measured by 32P-postlabeling) were highly significantly related to CYP1A1 (p < 0.0001) irrespective of smoking-status. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that CYP1A1 plays a significant role in lung DNA adduct formation and support a higher susceptibility to lung cancer among females."Lung	Pathophysiology	"It is controversial whether women have a higher lung cancer susceptibility compared to men.

Archival lung tissue was evaluated for the presence of nuclear estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and ER-beta and the relationship between ER status, subject characteristics, and survival.Paraffin-embedded lung tumor samples were obtained from 214 women and 64 men from two population-based, case-control studies as were 10 normal lung autopsy samples from patients without cancer. Nuclear ER-alpha and ER-beta expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with ER positivity and Cox proportional hazards models were used to measure survival differences by ER status.Neither tumor (0 of 94) nor normal (0 of 10) lung tissue stained positive for ER-alpha. Nuclear ER-beta positivity was present in 61% of tumor tissue samples (170 of 278; 70.3% in men and 58.3% in women) and 20% of normal tissue samples (2 of 10; P = 0.01). In multivariate analyses, females were 46% less likely to have ER-beta-positive tumors than males (odds ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-1.08). This relationship was stronger and statistically significant in adenocarcinomas (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.89). Women with ER-beta-positive tumors had a nonsignificant 73% (P = 0.1) increase in mortality, whereas men with ER-beta-positive tumors had a significant 55% (P = 0.04) reduction in mortality compared with those with ER-beta-negative tumors.This study suggests differential expression by sex and influence on survival in men of nuclear ER-beta in lung cancer, particularly in adenocarcinomas."Lung	Pathophysiology	"A role for estrogens in determining lung cancer risk and prognosis is suggested by reported sex differences in susceptibility and survival.

A 3-factor age-period-cohort (APC) model, in which the period variable is replaced by the product of average tar content and adult tobacco consumption per capita, was estimated for the US, UK, Canada and Australia by the maximum likelihood method. Age- and sex-specific tobacco consumption was estimated from historical data on smoking prevalence and total tobacco consumption. Lung cancer mortality was derived from vital registration records. Future tobacco consumption, tar content and the cohort parameter were projected by autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) estimation. The optimal exposure variable was found to be the product of average tar content and adult cigarette consumption per capita, lagged for 25-30 years for both males and females in all 4 countries. The coefficient of the product of average tar content and tobacco consumption per capita differs by age and sex. In all models, there was a statistically significant difference in the coefficient of the period variable by sex. In all countries, male age-standardized lung cancer mortality rates peaked in the 1980s and declined thereafter. Female mortality rates are projected to peak in the first decade of this century. The multiplicative models of age, tobacco exposure and cohort fit the observed data between 1950 and 1999 reasonably well, and time-series models yield plausible past trends of relevant variables. Despite a significant reduction in tobacco consumption and average tar content of cigarettes sold over the past few decades, the effect on lung cancer mortality is affected by the time lag between exposure and established disease. As a result, the burden of lung cancer among females is only just reaching, or soon will reach, its peak but has been declining for 1 to 2 decades in men. Future sex differences in lung cancer mortality are likely to be greater in North America than Australia and the UK due to differences in exposure patterns between the sexes."Lung	Outcomes	"The purpose of this work was to model lung cancer mortality as a function of past exposure to tobacco and to forecast age-sex-specific lung cancer mortality rates.

The median age at diagnosis was 66 years for both men and women. However, women accounted for 40.9% of patients who were < 50 years of age and for 35.4% of older patients. The incidence of lung cancer in men peaked at 72.5 per 100,000 person-years in 1984 and then declined to 47 per 100,000 person-years by 1999. In women, the incidence continued to rise to a peak of 33.1 per 100,000 person-years in 1991 before reaching a plateau at 30.2 to 32.3 per 100,000 person-years from 1992 to 1999. These changes have resulted in a marked narrowing of the male/female incidence ratio from 3.56 in 1975 to 1.56 in 1999. As initial treatment, women with local disease underwent surgery more frequently than did men. Stage-specific survival rates were better for women at all stages of disease (p < 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis, male gender was an independent negative prognostic factor (p < 0.0001).The incidence rate of lung cancer in women in the United States has reached a plateau. However, women are relatively overrepresented among younger patients, raising the question of gender-specific differences in the susceptibility to lung carcinogens.

Variations in MTHFR functions likely play roles in the etiology of lung cancer. The MTHFR gene has three nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (i.e., C677T, A1298C, and G1793A) that have a minor allele frequency of >5%. We investigated the associations between the frequencies of MTHFR variant genotypes and risk of lung cancer in a hospital-based case-control study of 1,051 lung cancer patients and 1,141 cancer-free controls in a non-Hispanic White population. We found that compared with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype, the 1298CC genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of lung cancer in women [(odds ratio (OR), 2.09; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.32-3.29)] but not in men (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.62-1.45). The MTHFR 677TT genotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of lung cancer in women (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.92) but not in men. No association was found between the MTHFR G1793A polymorphism and risk of lung cancer. Further analysis suggested evidence of gene-dietary interactions between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and dietary intake of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and methionine in women and evidence of gene-environment interactions between the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and tobacco smoking in men. In conclusion, the polymorphisms of MTHFR may contribute to the risk of lung cancer in non-Hispanic Whites and modify the risk associated with the dietary and environmental exposure in a sex-specific manner."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyzes the metabolism of folate and nucleotides needed for DNA synthesis and repair.

In this study, we examined biological significance of progesterone receptor in NSCLCs. Progesterone receptor immunoreactivity was detected in 106 of 228 NSCLCs (46.5%). Progesterone receptor-positive NSCLC was frequently detected in female and adenocarcinoma, and was inversely associated with tumor-node-metastasis stage and histologic differentiation. Progesterone receptor status was also associated with better clinical outcome of the patients, and a multivariate analysis revealed progesterone receptor status as an independent prognostic factor. Progesterone-synthesizing enzymes were detected in NSCLCs, and tissue concentration of progesterone was higher in these cases (n = 42). Immunoblotting analyses showed the presence of progesterone receptor in three NSCLC cell lines (A549, LCSC#2, and 1-87), but not in RERF-LC-OK or PC3. Transcriptional activities of progesterone receptor were increased by progesterone in these three progesterone receptor-positive NSCLC cells by luciferase assays. Cell proliferation was inhibited by progesterone in these progesterone receptor-positive NSCLC cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was inhibited by progesterone receptor blocker. Proliferation of these tumor cells injected into nude mice was also dose-dependently inhibited by progesterone, with a concomitant increase of p21 and p27 and a decrease of cyclin A, cyclin E, and Ki67. Results of our present study suggested that progesterone receptor was a potent prognostic factor in NSCLCs and progesterone inhibited growth of progesterone receptor-positive NSCLC cells. Therefore, progesterone therapy may be clinically effective in suppressing development of progesterone receptor-positive NSCLC patients."Lung	Pathophysiology	"A possible involvement of gender-dependent factors has been postulated in development of human non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC), but its details remain unclear.

We assessed the chemopreventive effects of antioxidant supplementation using B(a)P-DNA adducts in leukocytes as an intermediate cancer risk marker.Subjects were randomized to a double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial of antioxidant vitamin supplementation [500 mg vitamin C and 400 IU vitamin E (dl-alpha-tocopherol) daily] or placebo. Smokers with > or =10 cigarettes per day and serum cotinine > or =25 ng/mL were eligible for the study. B(a)P-DNA adduct level was the outcome. The randomization was stratified by gender and cigarettes per day (< or =20 or >20). Smoking habits and blood samples were collected every 3 months during the 15-month treatment period. Samples were analyzed for B(a)P-DNA adducts (high-performance liquid chromatography), plasma cotinine, vitamin levels, and GSTM1 genotype. The intent-to-treat model adjusted for B(a)P-DNA and cotinine at randomization.Overall and among men, there was no effect of treatment on B(a)P-DNA adduct levels. Among treated women, B(a)P-DNA adducts decreased by 31% compared with women on placebo (P = 0.03). Among treated women with the GSTM1 genotype, there was a 43% decrease in adducts (P = 0.04).Our primary hypothesis that the mean level of smoking-related B(a)P-DNA adducts would be lower in all subjects in the vitamin treatment group compared with all placebo-treated subjects was not substantiated. However, oursecondary gender-specific analysis found a significant reduction in B(a)P-DNA adducts in women with vitamin treatment, suggesting that antioxidant supplementation maymitigate some of the procarcinogenic effects of exposuretoB(a)P. The effect in GSTM1-null women suggeststhat certain subgroups may derive more benefit fromsupplementation. Although the results of this trial showthe potential chemopreventive role of antioxidants, thebest way for smokers to reduce their cancer risk remains smoking cessation."Lung	Management	"Female sex has been shown consistently to be a favorable prognostic factor in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Studies have shown that women with other tumor types experience greater treatment toxicity, but there have been few studies of sex-related toxicity in SCLC.This was a sex-based retrospective analysis of four SCLC trials conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group between 1987 and 1999. The 1,006 patients (648 males and 358 females) received similar chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine and etoposide-cisplatin. Toxicities examined included myelosuppression, stomatitis, vomiting, and infection. Other end points included dose reductions and omissions, response, and survival.Women experienced significantly more hematologic toxicity than men (grade 3 and 4 anemia, 16.3% v 7.6%, respectively, P < .001; grade 3 and 4 leukopenia, 80.4% v 69.2%, respectively, P = .0001). However, toxic death rates were similar for men and women (1.5% v 1.1%, respectively, P = .58). Women also had significantly more stomatitis and vomiting of all grades. Despite increased toxicity, 76% of females versus 73.4% of males received all six treatment cycles (P = .38), but 52% of females versus 43.4% of males had treatment delayed for 2 weeks or more (P = .022). Only 31.8% of females and 28.2% of males had at least one cycle of chemotherapy dose reduction (P = .23).

Here, we investigated the relationship between EGFR mutation and clinicopathologic features.EGFR mutational status of 120 NSCLCs was determined mainly in EGFR exons 18 to 21 by direct sequence and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters.EGFR mutations were present in 38 cases (32%) and the majority of mutations were in-frame deletions of exon 19 (19 cases) and a missense mutation in exon 21 (18 cases). EGFR mutations were frequently associated with adenocarcinoma (P < 0.0001), never smoker (P < 0.0001), and female gender (P = 0.0001). Of interest, increasing smoke exposure was inversely related to the rate of EGFR mutation (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that smoking and histology were independent variables. Furthermore, gender difference was observed for the mutational location (P = 0.01) dominance of exon 19 for males and exon 21 for females. Twenty-one cases were treated with gefitinib and found that EGFR mutation was significantly related to gefitinib responsiveness (P = 0.002). In addition, median survival times of patients with and without EGFR mutations treated with gefitinib were 25.1 and 14.0 months, respectively. Patients with EGFR mutations had approximately 2-fold survival advantage; however, the difference was not significant.We show that EGFR mutations were significantly related to histology and smoke exposure and were a strong predictive factor for gefitinib responsiveness in NSCLC."Lung	Pathophysiology	"It has been documented that estrogen receptor (ER) transcription silencing due to hypermethylation is linked to the tumor progression of breast, uterine and prostate cancers. Additionally, ER hypermethylation in lung tumors has been associated with the exposure of specific carcinogens in animal study. The role of hypermethylation-induced ER transcription silencing in lung tumor progression and its prognostic value for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients remained unclear. In our study, ER hypermethylation of 123 lung tumors and adjacent normal parts were examined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Estrogen receptor mRNA expression in lung tumors was determined by RT-PCR. Our data indicated that ER hypermethylation was only detected in lung tumors, but not in adjacent normal lung tissues. This suggests that ER hypermethylation may be associated with lung tumorigenesis. Among the clinical parameters studied, only gender factor was correlated with ER hypermethylation with a higher frequency of ER hypermethylation being in male patients than in female patients (58 vs. 34%, p = 0.01). After being stratified by gender and cigarette smoking status, a similarly high prevalence of ER hypermethylation was found in male smoking and nonsmoking patients (60 vs. 61%) as compared to that of female nonsmoking patients (34%). To investigate if 17-beta estradiol (E2) was responsible for such gender difference in ER hypermethylation, a lung cancer A549 cell with ER hypermethylation and without ER mRNA expression was treated with E2 of various concentrations for defined time intervals to show that an E2 treatment could restore the expression of ER mRNA and eliminate ER hypermethylation. Western blot data also showed that acetylated histone 3 and histone 4 of chromatin were increased significantly by E2 treatment. Thus, E2 can make ER mRNA re-expression by eliminating ER hypermethylation. To elucidate the prognostic value of ER hypermethylation, Kaplan-Meier analysis was carried out to show that patients with ER hypermethylation had a poorer prognosis than those without ER hypermethylation. Such prognostic prediction, however, applied only to male (p = 0.0044) patients. Cox regression analysis further showed the feasibility of ER hypermethylation as an independent prognostic factor of NSCLC (p = 0.007). It is possible that antiestrogens may have different therapeutic values for male and female lung cancer patients."Lung	Pathophysiology	"It has been documented that estrogen receptor (ER) transcription silencing due to hypermethylation is linked to the tumor progression of breast, uterine and prostate cancers. Additionally, ER hypermethylation in lung tumors has been associated with the exposure of specific carcinogens in animal study. The role of hypermethylation-induced ER transcription silencing in lung tumor progression and its prognostic value for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients remained unclear. In our study, ER hypermethylation of 123 lung tumors and adjacent normal parts were examined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Estrogen receptor mRNA expression in lung tumors was determined by RT-PCR. Our data indicated that ER hypermethylation was only detected in lung tumors, but not in adjacent normal lung tissues. This suggests that ER hypermethylation may be associated with lung tumorigenesis. Among the clinical parameters studied, only gender factor was correlated with ER hypermethylation with a higher frequency of ER hypermethylation being in male patients than in female patients (58 vs. 34%, p = 0.01). After being stratified by gender and cigarette smoking status, a similarly high prevalence of ER hypermethylation was found in male smoking and nonsmoking patients (60 vs. 61%) as compared to that of female nonsmoking patients (34%).

Several case-control studies suggested that women have greater risk of lung cancer compared with men at similar levels of cigarette smoking, whereas some large cohort studies failed to observe this association. Other studies indicated that lung cancer may have biological characteristics and mechanisms of carcinogenesis that are gender specific. Therefore, we hypothesized that women are more susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke exposure, as evidenced by a higher frequency of G:C-to-T:A somatic mutations in tumors from women in comparison with men at similar levels of tobacco smoke exposure. To investigate our hypothesis, we examined the TP53 mutational spectrum in a case-only (102 women and 201 men) series study where complete smoking information was available. A similar frequency and type of somatic TP53 mutations were observed in women and men. In conclusion, our study indicates that the TP53 mutation spectrum is similar in women and men. Our results are consistent with a recent large cohort study and summary of previous cohort studies, suggesting that women likely have equivalent susceptibility to lung cancer as men."Lung	Review	"To clarify etiology of lung cancer in nonsmoker females, various studies have been done. Particularly, host factors and environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) of females have been emphasized. However, traditional epidemiological data showed controversial results of sex or gender differences in lung cancer susceptibility and suggest presence of some confounders. One of them is that most of epidemiology studies are based on self-reports for ETS. To prevent misestimate effects of ETS via the self-report, exposure monitoring of ETS is required. On the other hand, focusing on genetic polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes and DNA repair, molecular epidemiological studies have been done in nonsmoker females. Therefore, this review considered: 1. gender differences in lung cancer; 2. effects of passive smoking on lung cancer; 3. exposure monitoring of ETS including genetic risks of lung cancer to clarify etiology of lung cancer in the nonsmoker females with molecular epidemiological discussion."Lung	Review	"To clarify etiology of lung cancer in nonsmoker females, various studies have been done.

A genotyping approach has been used to investigate NAT2 genotype with putative relevance in lung cancer in population of 110 Slovak-Caucasians patients and 167 non-malignant individuals from the same region. Slow acetylation was not observed to be a significant risk factor of lung cancer development (OR=1.19; 95% CI: 0.71-1.99). However, one genotype responsible for slow acetylation (NAT2*5B/*6) was observed significantly more frequently in lung cancer patients with squamous cell carcinoma compared with control subjects (OR=2.24; 95% CI: 1.14-4.34). Stratified analysis showed an increasing impact of the specific allelic combination NAT2*5B/*6 in non-smokers (OR=6.5; 95% CI: 1.25-15.08). In the case of squamous lung carcinoma an analysis revealed a tendency to adversely affect cancer risk in the individuals with the mentioned genotype in younger than 60 years (OR=3.14; 95% CI: 0.98-9.72) non-smokers (OR=10.40; 95% CI: 1.35-118.89) and in females (OR=4.25; 1.08-16.25). Additional studies are needed to confirm the results we observed and to assess the impact of other effects (specific allelic combinations, sex differences and histological subtype of lung cancer) on NAT2 susceptibility in lung carcinogenesis."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Epidemiological and biochemical studies have indicated that females may be at greater risk of smoking associated lung cancer compared with males. Among lung cancer patients, female smokers have been found to have higher levels of PAH-related DNA adducts and CYP1A1 gene expression in their normal lung tissue compared to male smokers. A possible role of steroid hormones in these sex differences via interactions between aryl hydrocarbon receptor and estrogen receptor mediated cellular effects has been suggested. In the present study the impact of the estrogen receptor (ERalpha) on CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 gene expression was studied in vitro in human bronchial epithelial cells. Transient transfection of the BEP2D cell line with ERalpha influenced neither constitutive expression of CYP1A1 or CYP1B1 nor induction of these genes by TCDD as measured by real-time RT-PCR. ERalpha had no effect on the constitutive or TCDD-induced enzymatic activity of CYP1A1 (EROD). We also studied the effect of steroid hormones on lung PAH metabolic activation in A/J mice. Intact and ovariectomized female mice were orally exposed to a single dose of benzo[a]pyrene. Ovariectomy did not influence the levels of either benzo[a]pyrene-derived protein or DNA adducts in the lung tissue measured by HPLC and 32P-postlabeling, respectively. In conclusion, the present data do not support the hypothesis of a role of estrogen or the ERalpha in regulating the metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in lung."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Epidemiological and biochemical studies have indicated that females may be at greater risk of smoking associated lung cancer compared with males.

In the other hand, it is well known that HPV 6/11 are frequently associated with upper aerodigestive and respiratory diseases. HPV 6/11 DNA were detected in lung tumors by nested PCR and in situ hybridization to investigate if any difference in prevalent types of HPV exists between genders. Our data showed that HPV 6 infection was detected in 28.4% (40 of 141) lung tumors, which was significantly higher than that in non-cancer controls (1.7%, 1 of 60; P < 0.0001), however, such high prevalence was not observed for HPV 11.

In a separate analysis, the ethnic distribution of patients enrolled in 2000 through 2002 was compared with those enrolled in 1996 through 1998, using logistic regression models to estimate the relative risk ratio of enrollment for racial and ethnic minorities to that of white patients during these time periods.Enrollment fraction, defined as the number of trial enrollees divided by the estimated US cancer cases in each race and age subgroup.Cancer research participation varied significantly across racial/ethnic and age groups. Compared with a 1.8% enrollment fraction among white patients, lower enrollment fractions were noted in Hispanic (1.3%; odds ratio [OR] vs whites, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.77; P<.001) and black (1.3%; OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.68-0.74; P<.001) patients. There was a strong relationship between age and enrollment fraction, with trial participants 30 to 64 years of age representing 3.0% of incident cancer patients in that age group, in comparison to 1.3% of 65- to 74-year-old patients and 0.5% of patients 75 years of age and older. This inverse relationship between age and trial enrollment fraction was consistent across racial and ethnic groups. Although the total number of trial participants increased during our study period, the representation of racial and ethnic minorities decreased. In comparison to whites, after adjusting for age, cancer type, and sex, patients enrolled in 2000 through 2002 were 24% less likely to be black (adjusted relative risk ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89; P<.001). Men were more likely than women to enroll in colorectal cancer trials (enrollment fractions: 2.1% vs 1.6%, respectively; OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.24-1.35; P<.001) and lung cancer trials (enrollment fractions: 0.9% vs 0.7%, respectively; OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.16-1.31; P<.001).Enrollment in cancer trials is low for all patient groups.

Despite prospective data that conflict with this hypothesis, mechanistic studies to find a biologic basis for a sex difference continue.We addressed the hypothesis directly by analyzing prospective data from former and current smokers in two large cohorts--the Nurses' Health Study of women and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study of men. We calculated incidence rates and hazard ratios of lung cancer in women compared with men, adjusting for age, number of cigarettes smoked per day, age at start of smoking, and time since quitting, using Cox proportional hazards models. We also reviewed published results from prospective analyses.From 1986 through 2000, 955 and 311 primary lung cancers were identified among 60 296 women and 25 397 men, respectively, who ranged in age from 40 to 79 years. Incidence rates per 100 000 person-years for women and men were 253 and 232, respectively, among current smokers and 81 and 73, respectively, among former smokers. The hazard ratio in women ever smokers compared with men was 1.11 (95% confidence interval = 0.95 to 1.31). Six published prospective cohort studies allowed assessment of comparative susceptibility to lung cancer by sex.

An increased susceptibility in women to the adverse effects of tobacco may be due to higher levels of DNA adducts, decreased DNA repair capacity, increased frequency of mutations in tumor suppressor genes, and hormonal differences. There are many sex and gender differences in lung cancer presentation, including a greater proportion of adenocarcinoma among women, a greater representation of women in cohorts of younger patients who have lung cancer, and women who do not smoke are more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than men.

Data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. In addition, a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to adjust for potential confounding factors.In the period studied, lung resections were performed in 253 patients with NSCLC, of whom 114 had stage I tumors. Four patients were excluded because of death in the immediate postoperative period, and 1 committed suicide. The 5-year survival rate was 85.5% for women and 46.4% for men (P<0.0001). The median overall survival time was 44.7 months (interquartile range [IQR(25%-75%)], 17.4-72.3 months) and was longer in women than in men: 63.9 months (IQR(25%5%), 35.2-98.7 months) versus 32.3 months (IQR(25%-75%), 11.8-61.5 months), respectively (P<0.0001). Gender effect was still present after adjustment by Cox regression for several factors (age, smoking habits, hemoglobin, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, tumor size, tumor-node-metastasis stage, histology, postoperative complications, and surgery type). The adjusted hazard ratio in women was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.09-0.59; (P<0.0001) when compared with men.This study confirms previous findings that women live longer than men after surgery for stage I NSCLC. This effect persisted after adjusting for several factors. These results highlight the fact that analyses of long-term survival of NSCLC patients, usually generalized to men and women as a whole, may be an inadequate extrapolation. These results question whether analyses of long-term survival, which commonly group men and women together, provide an adequate prognosis of survival rates in women with NSCLC."Lung	Epidemiology	"The gender difference in epidemiology of lung cancer has been postulated to be due to the higher susceptibility of women to risk factors especially tobacco smoking. Alternatively, such difference may also be explained by some unknown gender-specific etiological factors, which can have been masked if both the female and male prevalence of smoking are high. Hong Kong has a low female smoking prevalence rate and therefore the trend of the female incidence of lung cancer is particularly interesting because it can reflect the effects of the non-smoking related risk factors more clearly. The present study examined the trends of incidence rates for the major histologic types and smoking prevalence from 1983 to 2000 in Hong Kong with respect to gender. The prevalence of daily smokers decreased from 39.7% in 1982 to 22% in 2000 in males and from 5.6 to 3.5% in females. The time trends of the lung cancer incidence (overall or with respect to age and histology) were similar for both genders. The overall incidence decreased progressively throughout the study period, attributable to the decrease in squamous cell, small cell and large cell carcinoma. The decline occurred in all age groups but to a greater extent in the younger age groups. The incidence of adenocarcinoma increased until 1988-1990 and then stabilized. The initial increase was restricted to the older age groups. These temporal patterns suggested that the same etiological factors affected both genders to a different extent but manifested as similar changes in the direction of incidence over time. To confirm this hypothesis, further studies were needed to clarify the nature of these etiological factors for the non-smoking related lung cancer cases."Lung	Epidemiology	"The gender difference in epidemiology of lung cancer has been postulated to be due to the higher susceptibility of women to risk factors especially tobacco smoking.

Four patients were excluded because of death in the immediate postoperative period, and 1 committed suicide. The 5-year survival rate was 85.5% for women and 46.4% for men (P<0.0001). The median overall survival time was 44.7 months (interquartile range [IQR(25%-75%)], 17.4-72.3 months) and was longer in women than in men: 63.9 months (IQR(25%5%), 35.2-98.7 months) versus 32.3 months (IQR(25%-75%), 11.8-61.5 months), respectively (P<0.0001). Gender effect was still present after adjustment by Cox regression for several factors (age, smoking habits, hemoglobin, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, tumor size, tumor-node-metastasis stage, histology, postoperative complications, and surgery type). The adjusted hazard ratio in women was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.09-0.59; (P<0.0001) when compared with men.This study confirms previous findings that women live longer than men after surgery for stage I NSCLC. This effect persisted after adjusting for several factors. These results highlight the fact that analyses of long-term survival of NSCLC patients, usually generalized to men and women as a whole, may be an inadequate extrapolation. These results question whether analyses of long-term survival, which commonly group men and women together, provide an adequate prognosis of survival rates in women with NSCLC."Lung	Outcomes	"This study comprised a total of 7,553 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (2,660 women and 4,893 men) treated at a comprehensive cancer centre between 1974 and 1998. Significant differences in tumour histology were associated with gender (p < 0.001); adenocarcinoma was the most common diagnosis in both men (50.0%) and women (41.7%); squamous cell carcinoma was the second most prevalent diagnosis (21% and 31% in women and men, respectively); and bronchioalveolar tumours were more prevalent in men (3% compared with 7% in women). Frequency distributions with local, regional or distant disease at registration were similar between men and women (p = 0.906). In a multivariable Cox regression analysis the indications were that gender is an important risk factor for survival. Adjusting for age, stage, treatment received and ability to pay for care, a statistically significant interaction between gender and tumour histology (p = 0.043) was found, where, in relation to female sex and histologies other than squamous carcinoma, women who presented with squamous carcinoma had an increased risk of death (HR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.18) while men had an increased risk of death for all histologies (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.21-1.40, and HR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.07-1.24 for squamous and other histologies, respectively). This study confirms previous reports of strong gender-dependent differences in survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, including a histology-specific effect in women."Lung	Outcomes	"This study comprised a total of 7,553 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (2,660 women and 4,893 men) treated at a comprehensive cancer centre between 1974 and 1998.

In this study, 101 patients attending a rapid access clinic at Papworth Hospital with a diagnosis of lung cancer were asked to assess their own ECOG PS score on a scale between 0 and 4. Patients' scores were compared to the PS assessment of them made by their oncologists. Of 98 patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), weighted kappa statistics showed PS score agreement between patient and oncologist of 0.45. Both patient- and oncologist-assessed scores reflected survival duration (in NSCLC and SCLC) as well as disease stage (in NSCLC), with oncologist-assessed scores being only marginally more predictive of survival. There was no sex difference in patient assessment of PS scores, but oncologists scored female patients more pessimistically than males. This study showed that, with few exceptions, patients and oncologists assessed PS scores similarly. Although oncologists should continue to score PS objectively, it may benefit their clinical practice to involve their patients in these assessments."Lung	Review	"Epidemiologic evidence points to gender-based differences in incidence, risk, histology, and pathogenesis of certain lung diseases in women as compared with men. Gender influences not only physiological differences, but also the social, economic, and cultural context in which men and women coexist. Central to these differences is the role of sex hormones, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease or serve as protective factors. This paper seeks to review the role of gender in major areas of pulmonary disease and explore the mechanisms that may underlie gender differences in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mycobacterial disease (tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare infection), on lung cancer."Lung	Management	"Consecutive cancer referrals to a palliative medicine program were evaluated to assess nutritional status using a standard protocol. The study included 352 patients (180 men, 172 women; median age 61 years, range 22-94 years). The most common diagnosis was lung cancer. All had metastatic disease, 139 with gastrointestinal involvement. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms were weight loss ( n=307), anorexia ( n=285), and early satiety ( n=243). Of those with any weight loss, 71% had lost >or0% of their pre-illness weight. The most common factor identified which might have contributed to weight loss was hypophagia ( n=275/307). Men had lost weight more often and to a greater extent than women. Triceps skinfold (TSF) was measured in 337: 51% had values that suggested severe fat deficiency. Upper mid-arm muscle area (AMA) was measured in 349: 30% had evidence of significant muscle mass reduction. The body mass index (BMI) was normal or increased in most patients. Calculated resting energy expenditure (REE) ( n=324) was high in 41%. C-reactive protein was elevated in 74% of those measured ( n=50). We conclude that: (1).most of this group of cancer patients referred to palliative medicine had severe weight loss; (2).there was a gender difference in the severity and type of weight loss; (3).males lost more weight overall and more muscle than females; (4).males with any degree of weight loss had a higher REE than females; (5).a significant correlation existed between the time from diagnosis to death and the severity of weight loss in the prior month; (6).BMI was normal in most patients, suggesting precancer diagnosis obesity; and (7).both TSF and AMA correlated well with body composition of both fat and protein as determined by bioelectrical impedance."Lung	Management	"Men with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are more susceptible to weight loss than women. The composition and aetiology of these gender specific weight changes are not known.Measurements of body mass, body composition and energy balance (resting energy expenditure and energy intake) were made in 15 men and six women before and after chemotherapy for NSCLC.Over the course of chemotherapy minimal weight change was observed in both men and women. Men increased body fat from 25.0 +/- 5.5 to 27.9 +/- 7.9% (P < 0.05) whereas fat free mass (FFM) tended to decrease (P = 0.063). There was no change in body fat or FFM in the women. In the men resting energy expenditure decreased over the course of chemotherapy from 113.2 +/- 15.9 to 105.1 +/- 10.1% of the value predicted from the Harris Benedict equation (P < 0.05). In the women resting energy expenditure (REE) did not alter.Over the course of chemotherapy for NSCLC, men and women appear to have different patterns of change in body composition and in energy expenditure."Lung	Pathophysiology	"CYP3A isozymes are involved in tobacco carcinogen- and steroid-metabolism, and are expressed in human lung tissue showing interindividual variation in expression and activity. The CYP3A4*1B allele has been associated with a two-fold higher promoter activity and with high-grade prostate cancers. The very frequent intron 3 polymorphism in the CYP3A5 gene (CYP3A5*3) results in decreased CYP3A5 protein levels. A case-control study was conducted in 801 Caucasian lung cancer patients that included 330 adenocarcinomas, 260 squamous cell carcinomas, 171 small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and 432 Caucasian hospital-based controls. CYP3A-genotyping was performed by capillary polymerase chain reaction followed by fluorescence-based melting curve analysis. A significantly increased SCLC risk for CYP3A4*1B allele carriers [odds ratio (OR) 2.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-4.55, P=0.02] was found. After dividing cases and controls by gender, an increased lung cancer risk for CYP3A4*1B carriers (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.94-9.90, P=0.06) for women but not for men (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56-1.81) was revealed. Heavier smoking men (> or =20 pack-years) with the CYP3A4*1B allele had a significant OR for lung cancer of 3.42 (95% CI 1.65-7.14, P=0.001) compared to *1A/*1A carriers with lower tobacco exposure (<20 pack-years). For women, the respective OR was 8.00 (95% CI 2.12-30.30, P=0.005). Genotype frequencies were generally in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, except for CYP3A5 where a greater than expected number of CYP3A5*1 homozygotes was observed among cases (P=0.006). In addition, we observed linkage disequilibrium of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (P<0.00001), but a non-significantly increased lung cancer risk was only found for homozygous CYP3A5*1 allele carriers (OR 5.24, 95% CI 0.85-102.28, P=0.14) but not for heterozygotes. To confirm our observation that the CYP3A4*1B allele increases SCLC risk and modifies the smoking-related lung cancer risk in a gender-specific manner, further studies, including CYP3A haplotype analysis, will be necessary."Lung	Clinical	"Consecutive cancer referrals to a palliative medicine program were evaluated to assess nutritional status using a standard protocol.

We conducted a retrospective study of the 967 consecutive recorded patients (696 men and 91 women after exclusions) diagnosed with small cell lung cancers (SCLC) between 1981 and 1994 in the Bas-Rhin population-based cancer registry to determine if such particularities could be observed in SCLC. Data included demographic and social characteristics, medical and smoking history, management (diagnosis and treatment), hospitalisation and survival. The end point for survival was 31 December 1998. Women were more frequently single, divorced, or widowed (P=0.007) and lived more often in urban areas (places with more than 10,000 inhabitants) (P=0.017). They differed significantly from men in their tobacco exposure (P=0.0001) and non-smoking rates (P=0.0003) but not in clinical presentation, except for more frequently elevated LDH levels (P=0.02). Bone marrow biopsies were more often performed in men (P=0.004), but management was otherwise comparable. The mean number of hospitalisations (for any reason) was comparable in both sexes but women tended to remain hospitalised longer (P=0.057). Overall survival did not differ, but women older than 70 years died sooner than their male counterparts (P=0.026). Our study confirms that some of gender differences reported in the lung cancer literature exist in SCLC. Sex-related differences in LDH levels have not previously been reported, to our knowledge. North American and European data concerning survival among women and men are discordant. Whether these gender differences are related to a real difference between the sexes or simply to differential exposure to carcinogens remains to be determined."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Epidemiologic evidence suggests that pulmonary diseases with a prominent chronic inflammatory component elevate lung cancer risk. Genetic manipulations of mouse models of lung inflammation and tumorigenesis can be used to investigate this association. The genes encoding pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and antiinflammatory IL-10 cytokines map within quantitative trait loci that regulate susceptibility to lung tumor development in mice; sensitive A/J and resistant C57BL/6J (B6) mice have different Tnfa and Il-10 alleles. Genetic ablation studies were performed to examine whether these genes would qualify as candidate tumor modifiers. Tnfa null (-/-) mice on a B6 background and B6.129 Il-10(-/-) mice were intercrossed with A/J mice and subjected to urethane carcinogenesis; lung tumor multiplicity was determined 20 weeks later. In the absence of one copy of Tnfa, tumor number. Male Il-10(+/+) mice developed more tumors than did female mice (P < 0.001), absence of one copy of Il-10 raised tumor number in female mice to that observed in +/+ males, but no change in multiplicity occurred in Il-10 hemizygous males. Thus, a deficit of pro-inflammatory TNFalpha decreased the number of tumors, whereas diminished gene copy number of anti-inflammatory IL-10 increased tumorigenesis; manifestation of an effect of Il-10 haploinsufficiency is gender dependent. These studies support a role for inflammation in lung cancer susceptibility."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Epidemiologic evidence suggests that pulmonary diseases with a prominent chronic inflammatory component elevate lung cancer risk.

In the 19th century, the lung cancer was rare but it incidence increase drastically during the 20th century, and the tendency is to continue in the 20th century. Actually the lung cancer's incidence and mortality are higher in the developed countries, especially in Europe and Unites States of America, with a increasing in the women incidence. These geographic differences and gender differences are related with smoking habits. Women begin to smoke earlier and have more difficulty to stop, because of problems related with obesity; they have more sensibility to the carcinogens and the risk of lung cancer is 1.5 times higher than the men with the same habits. Adenocarcinoma is the more frequent histological type in young people, in the total of the women and in non-smokers. Many factors since tobacco, home and professional pollution, nutritional, associated diseases even genetic and hormonal factors have been investigated to define its influence in development in women lung cancer. It specificity in women with lung cancer is the common problem for the medical people to treat this disease (pathology).The literature about this problem is not clear, and is necessary to advance with many studies in this area with the objective to clarify this important question."Lung	Review	"The epidemiology of lung cancer has changed in the last years in several countries all over the world.

Gender differences in cigarette smoking have diminished in recent birth cohorts, however, especially among whites. We used U.S. population-based incidence and mortality data and examined trends in age-specific rates of lung cancer by birth cohort according to gender, ethnic group, and histology to evaluate the generational changes in U.S. lung cancer risk for men vs. women. All tests of statistical significance are 2-sided (95% confidence interval [CI]). Lung cancer mortality rates have converged between men and women born after 1960, especially in whites. The male-to-female (M:F) mortality rate ratio for ages 35-39 years decreased from 3.0 (95% CI = 2.7-3.4) around the 1915 birth cohort to 1.1 (95% CI = 1.0-1.1) around the 1960 birth cohort among whites and from 4.0 (95% CI = 3.2-5.0) around the 1925 birth cohort to 1.5 (95% CI = 1.3-1.7) around the 1960 birth cohort among blacks. Similarly, incidence rates for white men and women converged rapidly for adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, but less so for squamous cell carcinoma. These findings reflect the smoking patterns among white and black men and women: cigarette smoking prevalence at age 24 was essentially equal among white men and women born after 1960 but continued to be higher in black men than women. The convergence of lung cancer death rates among men and women born after 1960s supports the idea that males and females maybe equally susceptible to develop lung cancer from a given amount of cigarette smoking, rather than the hypothesis that women are more susceptible."Lung	Epidemiology	"More than a decade ago, an increased risk for bladder cancer among male hairdressers was established. Frequent changes of hair dye formulations together with their widespread use call for safety guarantees. We carried out a follow-up study of a cohort of 38866 female and 6824 male hairdressers from Sweden and analyzed all of their malignancies over a period of 39 years. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 28 cancer sites were calculated using the economically active population as a reference. During the years 1960-1998 a total of 1043 cancer cases were recorded in male hairdressers. Excess risks for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract and lung and colorectal adenocarcinoma were observed. Additionally, male hairdressers working in 1960 had an increased risk for urinary bladder cancer, which was highest in the 1960s with an SIR of 2.56 (95% CI 1.36-4.39) and decreased with the follow-up time. A total of 2858 cancers were recorded in female hairdressers. An increased risk was observed for cancers of the pancreas, lung and cervix and in situ cancer of the skin. The increased risk for in situ skin cancer specifically affected the scalp and neck, sites of contact for hair dyes, with an SIR of 2.43 (95% CI 1.14-4.44). The increase in lung cancer, the only site for which cancer was increased in either sex, may depend on confounding from smoking. Bladder cancer was not increased among hairdressers in the recent decades and is therefore not likely to be associated with modern hair dyes."Lung	Epidemiology	"Age-specific rates of lung cancer have been consistently higher for men than for women in the United States, due primarily to different patterns of cigarette smoking.

Because of its importance, many aspects of TP53 have been studied, including preneoplastic lesions and TP53as a marker for early detection and prognosis and as a therapeutic option. We summarize recent knowledge of TP53 in lung cancer with a special emphasis on the relationship between smoking exposure (e.g, cigarette, etc.) and specific mutational pattern of TP53by analyzing the latest version of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) database on TP53 mutations in human cancer. Our analysis confirmed several other studies showing significant differences in the frequencies of G:C to T:A transversions between ever-smokers and never-smokers. Furthermore, when comparing the mutational spectrum by gender, important differences were noted between male and female never-smokers. We concluded that the previously noted G:C to T:A transversions were mainly due to female smokers having a high frequency of these changes compared to female never-smokers. There was no relationship between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas independent of gender. We also examined the seven codons which have been previously identified as hot spots, that is, the sites of frequent G:C to T:A transversions in smoking-related lung cancers. However, there was no specific codon which was strongly related to smoke exposure despite a moderate relationship. We considered the term ""warmspot"" may be more appropriate. While mutations of TP53 are frequent in lung cancers, further investigation is necessary to understand their role for lung carcinogenesis, especially as they relate to gender differences, and to translate our laboratory knowledge to clinical applications."Lung	Review	"Of the various genetic alterations in lung cancer, the abnormalities of the TP53 gene (p53) are among the most frequent and important events.

However, characterizing risk at low doses requires large populations and ideally should include a large proportion of women, both of which rarely are available.Among 90305 radiologic technologists in the U.S. (77% women) who were followed during 1983-1998, data concerning incident cancer occurrence was obtained from mailed questionnaires and from death records. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were computed using age-specific, gender-specific, race-specific, and calendar year-specific cancer rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program.The SIR for all cancers in both genders combined was 1.04 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.00-1.07; n = 3292 technologists). Female technologists had an elevated risk for all solid tumors combined (SIR = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; n = 2168 women) and for breast cancers (SIR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.09-1.23; n = 970 women), melanoma (SIR = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.43-1.89; n = 181 women), and thyroid cancers (SIR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.24-1.83; n = 107 women). Male technologists experienced a decreased risk for solid tumors (SIR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-0.98; n = 755 men); however, melanoma (SIR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00-1.79; n = 56 men) and thyroid cancers (SIR = 2.23; 95% CI, 1.29-3.59; n = 17 men) were increased. Among both genders, the risks were decreased for buccal cavity/pharyngeal cancers (SIR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.90; n = 54 technologists), rectal cancers (SIR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.48-0.76; n = 53 technologists), and lung cancers (SIR = 0.77, 95% CI, 0.70-0.85; n = 307 technologists).The elevated risk for breast cancer may have been related to occupational radiation exposure. The observed excesses of melanoma and thyroid cancers may reflect, at least in part, earlier detection among medical workers with easy access to health care."Lung	Epidemiology	"In recent years much attention has been focused on the rapidly increasing incidence of primary lung cancer in women. The aim of this study was to determine gender differences in patients treated surgically for lung cancer.We performed a retrospective review of patients who had lung resection for primary lung cancer from January 1994 to December 1998.There were 530 men and 42 women. Women were younger than men (55.6 +/- 10 versus 57 +/- 9.9). The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.9). The mean cigarette consumption was greater in men than in women (p < 0.001). We observed a higher operative morbidity and mortality rate in men compared to women (p < 0.05). Men had more squamous cell carcinoma (61.7%). In female patients, squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma were found with almost the same incidence (35.7% versus 33.3%). There was a significant difference in the distribution of cell types (p < 0.001). Pathologic stages for women were; I = 38.2%, II = 21.4%, IIIa = 21.4%, IIIb = 9.5%, IV = 9.5% and for men; I = 40.4%, II = 26.6%, IIIa = 24%, IIIb = 6%, IV = 3%. There was no significant difference in the stage distribution between genders (p = 0.2). Median survival for female and male patients were 38 +/- 9.2 and 35 +/- 3.2 months. Female patients' survival was longer than male patients but the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).This study emphasizes sex differences in cigarette consumption, operative mortality and the distribution of cell types of patients with primary lung cancer. These initial results should strongly encourage additional studies in different countries on the interaction between sex and lung cancer characteristics to improve clarity."Lung	Outcomes	"In recent years much attention has been focused on the rapidly increasing incidence of primary lung cancer in women.

There are major smoke exposure, histology, geography and gender-related changes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated smoking-related, histologic, geographic and gender differences in the methylation profiles of resected NSCLCs. We examined 514 cases of NSCLC and 84 corresponding nonmalignant lung tissues from 4 countries (USA, Australia, Japan and Taiwan) for the methylation status of 7 genes known to be frequently methylated in lung cancers [p16, RASSF1A (RAS association domain family 1), APC, RARbeta, CDH13, MGMT and GSTP1]. Multivariate analyses were used for data analysis. Adenocarcinoma was the major histologic type in women and never smokers; analyses that involved smoke exposure and gender were limited to this histology. Our major findings are a) methylation status of any single gene was largely independent of methylation status of other genes; b) the rates of methylation of p16 and APC and the mean Methylation Index (MI), a reflection of the overall methylation status, were significantly higher in ever smokers than in never smokers; c) the mean MI of tumors arising in former smokers was significantly lower than the mean of current smokers; d) the methylation rates of APC, CDH13 and RARbeta were significantly higher in adenocarcinomas than in squamous cell carcinomas; e) methylation rates of MGMT and GSTP1 were significantly higher in the USA and Australian cases than in those from Japan and Taiwan; and (f) no significant gender-related differences in methylation patterns were noted. Our findings demonstrate important smoke exposure, histologic type and geography-related differences in the methylation profiles of NSCLC tumors."Lung	Clinical	"Aberrant methylation of several known or putative tumor suppressor genes occurs frequently during the pathogenesis of lung cancers.

Recognizing that the increase in smoking among women relative to men is the proximate cause of the changing sex difference in rates of lung cancer, I analyzed two approaches to identify the more distant sources of the changes. A gender-equality argument suggests that the difference is related to the more general equalization of women's and men's work and family roles, which also encourages the adoption of harmful behaviors such as smoking by women. An alternative explanation suggests that the convergence in mortality from lung cancer among men and women is the byproduct of a lag in the adoption, diffusion, and abatement of smoking by women. Using mortality data on 21 nations from 1955 to 1996, an analysis of logged rates of men's and women's lung cancer mortality and the logged ratio of the rates demonstrated little relationship between the sex difference and gender equality. However, I found a strong and consistent relationship between the sex difference and the stage of diffusion of the use of cigarettes."Lung	Review	"After decades of widening, the difference in mortality from lung cancer between men and women has begun to narrow in recent years.

Using the entire population of Olmsted County, Minnesota, we looked at trends in the rate of brain metastases in people diagnosed with primary lung or breast cancers between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 2001. Yearly rates of brain metastases detection following the primary tumors were calculated from a combination of medical record and SEER database information. Trends in rates and gender differences were assessed. There was no discernible increase in the rates of brain metastases secondary to lung or breast cancer during the period of observation. However, women were twice as likely as men to have brain metastases detected following a primary lung cancer. This difference was constant over the time period. This twofold difference in brain metastases detected in women versus men with lung cancer deserves further evaluation and confirmation."Lung	Epidemiology	"Patients suffering from atherosclerotic diseases are prone to repeated episodes of ischemia/reperfusion that has been demonstrated to induce oxidative stress by formation of oxygen free radicals. It might therefore be expected that such endogenously exposure to free radicals increases the individual cancer risk in patients with atherosclerotic diseases. We therefore studied the sex-specific risk of lung cancer and other cancers in atherosclerotic patients in a prospective study conducted in the Copenhagen area. The study cohort was linked to the Danish Hospital Discharge Register and we identified 2261 1-year survivors of atherosclerotic diseases through 1977 and 1993, while 26150 of the study subjects had no record of an atherosclerotic diagnosis. After linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry associations between atherosclerosis and cancer were analysed for each sex separately by means of Cox proportional hazard regression models. Atherosclerotic women had a significant RR of lung cancer of 3.26 (95% CI: 1.95-5.46) compared to non-atherosclerotic women after adjustment for age, calendar period, study population, smoking habits, school education and alcohol consumption. No significant risk of male lung cancer, RR=1.12 (95% CI: 0.77-1.64), or other smoking-related cancers in either sex was observed after multivariate adjustment. Atherosclerosis did not predict non-smoking-related cancers in general in either men, RR=0.91 (95% CI 0.69-1.20), or women, RR=0.93 (95% CI: 0.64-1.35). We hypothesize that oxidative stress due to episodes of ischemia/reperfusion increases the risk of lung cancer in atherosclerotic females because of a gender specific susceptibility to oxidative DNA damage."Lung	Outcomes	"Increased duration of cancer survival may allow a longer window for detection of metastases, including brain metastases.

By the early 1980s a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential had occurred in some countries, where it reached a maximum and thereafter followed a declining trend. Of particular interest to the present investigation is the anomalous experience of Japan, where unlike other high-income countries the female advantage in life expectancy has been expanding. We contrast the case of Japan with that of Sweden, where, like many other high-income nations, the sex differential in longevity has been narrowing in recent years. We observe that in Sweden, until the early 1980s, the sex gap in life expectancy (female-male) exceeded that of Japan; but this situation reversed in subsequent periods, when the Swedish differential narrowed and that of Japan widened. A decomposition analysis indicates that these divergent patterns since 1980 have resulted mainly from larger than expected reductions in male mortality in Sweden due to heart disease and from accidents and violence, lung cancer and ""other"" cancers. In Japan, death rates for men and women from heart disease--which is a leading cause of death--have tended to decline more or less at the same pace since the early 1980s; and with regard to lung cancer, and ""other"" neoplasms, male death rates in Japan have been rising while those of women have either declined or risen more slowly. Moreover, during the 1990s, male and female suicide rates rose in Japan, but the rates for men went up faster. Altogether, the net effect of these divergent mortality trends for men and women in Japan underlie much of the observed widening of its sex differential in longevity in recent years."Lung	Epidemiology	"Gender differences in the histological distribution of lung carcinoma and a possibly greater susceptibility of women than men to tobacco carcinogens, suggest a possible influence of sex-specific hormones. This study examines endocrine factors and risk of lung cancer among women by smoking status and histology.We used data of a case-control study on lung cancer conducted from 1990 to 1996 in Germany, including 811 histologically confirmed female cases and 912 female population controls. Information on various menstrual and reproductive factors, use of oral contraceptives (OC), hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and smoking was gathered through personal interviews using a structured questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI adjusted for age, region, smoking, and education were calculated via logistic regression.A reduction in lung cancer risk was observed with the use of OC (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.51-0.92), but no trend in risk with increasing duration of use, age at first use, or calendar year of first use was present. A history of HRT was associated with a reduced risk (OR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.64-1.09), particularly after long duration (>/=7 years) (OR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37-0.93). No clear association was found with regard to age at menarche, length of menstrual cycle, number of live-births, and age at menopause. Overall results did not differ much by histological cell subtype. The reduction in lung cancer risk associated with the use of exogenous hormones was primarily seen among smoking women.Our data provide evidence for a possible role of hormonal factors in the aetiology of lung cancer in women."Lung	Clinical	"Gender differences in the histological distribution of lung carcinoma and a possibly greater susceptibility of women than men to tobacco carcinogens, suggest a possible influence of sex-specific hormones.

Cancer of the lung and bronchus was responsible for one-quarter of all cancer deaths among U.S. women last year, killing approximately 67,000 women. This is related both to the demographics of smoking among women and the poor survival rate for persons with lung cancer. Epidemiologic evidence from a number of studies suggests that women are more susceptible to tobacco-induced carcinogenesis than men, taking into account baseline exposure, body weight, body height, and body mass index. More recently, there has been increasing biochemical and genetic data to support this male-female difference in susceptibility. Patients with lung cancer currently have few therapeutic options. Understanding these new genetic developments may pave the road for innovative therapeutic approaches for women and new screening methods to determine those at greatest risk for developing lung cancer. Clearly, smoking-related disease among women is a major public health issue that will require effective programs for smoking prevention and cessation among females. Both sex and gender differences in smoking-related disease will be discussed in this review."Lung	Review	"Each year more than 400,000 Americans die from diseases directly related to smoking, and lung cancer is now the leading cause of death from neoplasia in U.S. men and women.

Over the last decade individual genetic variability of the estradiol metabolism has been described as a significant contributor to disease susceptibility with variations depending on ethnic background. Among others, genetic variations of genes encoding cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play an important role in this regard. Mutant alleles of the CYP 1A1 gene are major modulators of lung cancer risk among smokers, mediate gender differences in lung cancer susceptibility, and have been associated with an elevated risk for developing breast, prostate, colorectal, and oral squamous cell cancer. Variants of the CYP 1B1 gene modulate the risk for developing prostate, ovarian, lung, and breast cancer. Also, mutations in the CYP 1B1 gene are the major genetic determinant of congenital glaucoma. Mutant CYP 17 alleles are associated with serum and plasma levels of steroid hormones, use of hormone replacement therapy, and the development of endometrial, prostate, and breast cancer. Available data indicate that the protective effect against breast cancer of a later age at menarche is limited to wild-type CYP 17 allele carriers. Among women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, carriage of mutant CYP 17 alleles is sufficient to aggravate the clinical presentation of the disease. Molecular variants of the CYP 19 gene are associated with an increased risk for developing breast cancer, advanced breast cancer stages, and tumor aromatase production. Carriage of a mutant catechol-O-methyltransferase allele is associated with breast cancer, neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and modulates behavior among patients with schizophrenia, alcoholics and the general population. In summary, the available evidence points to genes that encode estrogen-metabolizing enzymes as strong hereditary determinants of the susceptibility to benign as well as malignant conditions."Lung	Management	"Cancer chemotherapy is limited by the modest therapeutic index of most antineoplastic drugs. Some glucuronide prodrugs may display selective anti-tumour activity against tumours that accumulate beta-glucuronidase. We examined the toxicity and anti-tumour activity of 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide, a new glucuronide prodrug of 9-aminocamptothecin, to evaluate its potential clinical utility. 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide was 25-60 times less toxic than 9-aminocamptothecin to five human cancer cell lines. Beta-glucuronidase activated 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide to produce similar cell killing as 9-aminocamptothecin or topotecan. The in vivo toxicity of 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide in BALB/c mice was dose-, route-, sex- and age-dependent. 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide was significantly less toxic to female than to male mice but the difference decreased with age. 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide and 9-aminocamptothecin produced similar inhibition (approximately 80%) of LS174T human colorectal carcinoma tumours. 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide cured a high percentage of CL1-5 human lung cancer xenografts with efficacy that was similar to or greater than 9-aminocamptothecin, irinotecan and topotecan. The potent anti-tumour activity of 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide suggests that this prodrug should be further evaluated for cancer treatment."Lung	Review	"Estradiol is a pleiotropic hormone, involved in the etiology of a wide variety of diseases.

Epidemiologic work has previously suggested that exposure of the lung to tobacco carcinogens at an early age may be an independent risk factor for lung cancer. Recent studies at the molecular and cellular levels are consistent with this, now suggesting that early exposure enhances DNA damage and is associated with the induction of DNA alterations in specific chromosomal regions. In this paper we hypothesize that adolescence, which is known to be the period of greatest development for the lung, may constitute a ""critical period"" in which tobacco carcinogens can induce fields of genetic alterations that make the early smoker more susceptible to the damaging effects of continued smoking. The fact that lung development differs by sex might also contribute to apparent gender differences in lung cancer susceptibility. Because this hypothesis has important implications for health policy and tobacco control, additional resources need to be devoted to its further evaluation. Targeted intervention in adolescent smoking may yield even greater reductions in lung cancer occurrence than otherwise anticipated."Lung	Review	"Cigarette smoking by children and adolescents continues to be prevalent, and this fact represents a major public health problem and challenge.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to probe mRNA expression of wild-type ERalpha and ERbeta and their splice variants in human bronchogenic tumor and adjacent nontumor specimens. In tumor tissue from 13 women and 13 men, ERalpha was expressed in 85% of women versus 15% in men [P=0.001]. ERbeta was expressed equally in tumors from women versus men [92% vs. 69%, P=ns]. Both ERalpha and beta forms were expressed simultaneously in the lung tumors of 77% of women versus 15% of men [P=0.005]. Among adjacent nontumor lung specimens, 31% of the women expressed ERalpha mRNA versus 0% of men [P=0.101], and 39% of women expressed ERbeta mRNA versus 31% of men [P=ns]; only one woman and no men expressed both ERalpha and beta in nontumor tissue. Females expressed ERalpha [P=0.017], ERbeta [P=0.013], and ERalpha+beta [P=0.002] more frequently in tumor versus nontumor tissue, whereas in males expression of ERalpha, beta and both alpha+beta was not clearly different for tumor versus nontumor tissue. In specimens expressing ERalpha mRNA, the transcript lacking exon 7 (delta7) was the major splice variant with varying contributions from the transcripts delta4, delta3+4, delta5 and others unidentified. Alternative splicing of ERbeta mRNA was observed, but not to as great an extent as for ERalpha mRNA. ERalpha promoter usage in tumors varied among individuals. When the ER receptors were co-expressed in tumors, ERalpha was quantitatively more abundant in the majority of cases than ERbeta. Within this small group of 26 patients, no correlation was found between age, smoking history, plasma nicotine, cotinine, estradiol concentrations or histopathologic type with tumor or nontumor estrogen receptor status of any type. However, several positive correlations imply that: (1) ERalpha expression occurs more often in the lungs of women than men; (2) ERbeta is expressed with approximately equal frequency in the lungs of both genders; and (3) tumors display a higher frequency of both receptor types than nontumors in women. We hypothesize that these putative gender-dependent differences in ERalpha and ERbeta expression could contribute unique phenotypic characteristics to lung cancer development or progression in women."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Estrogen receptor (ER) expression in human lung has been understudied, particularly in light of its potential biological importance in the female lung cancer epidemic.

Among women with the Polycystic Ovary (PCO) syndrome, mutant CYP 17 alleles are sufficient to aggravate the clinical presentation of the disease. Molecular variants of the CYP 19 gene are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer, advanced disease stage, and tumor aromatase production. Carriage of a mutant catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) allele is associated with breast cancer, neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and modulates behavior among patients with schizophrenia, alcoholics and the general population. In summary, the available evidence points to estrogen metabolising genes as strong hereditary determinants of the susceptibility to benign and malignant conditions."Lung	Review	"Estradiol is a pleiotropic hormone, involved in the etiology of a wide variety of diseases. Over the last decade individual genetic variability of the estradiol metabolism has been described as a significant contributor to disease susceptibility with variations depending on ethnic background. Among others, genetic variations of genes encoding cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play an important role in this regard. Mutant alleles of the CYP 1A1 gene are major modulators of lung cancer risk among smokers, mediate gender differences in lung cancer susceptibility, and have been associated with an elevated risk for breast, prostate, colorectal, and oral squamous cell cancer. Variants of the CYP 1B1 gene modulate the risk for prostate, ovarian, lung, and breast cancer. Also, mutations in the CYP 1B1 gene are the major genetic determinant of congenital glaucoma. Mutant CYP 17 alleles are associated with serum and plasma levels of steroid hormones, use of hormone replacement therapy, and endometrial, prostate, and breast cancer.

To validate this reclassification, we reviewed our experience with en bloc lung and chest wall resection for bronchogenic carcinoma.From February 1985 to November 1999, 95 en bloc lung and chest wall resections were performed on 94 patients (62 men and 32 women). The median age was 66 years (range, 38-93 years). Pancoast tumors were excluded. Factors that may affect survival were analyzed with univariate analysis, and factors found to be significant univariately were analyzed multivariately to determine whether the significant association remained after adjusting for other significant factors.Presenting symptoms included chest wall pain in 42 patients, cough in 17 patients, and ""other"" in 16 patients. Twenty patients were asymptomatic. Ninety-two patients were current or former smokers (median pack-years, 50; range, 8-150 pack-years). Seventy-five lobectomies, 12 pneumonectomies, 5 bilobectomies, 2 wedge excisions, and 1 segmentectomy were performed. The number of ribs resected ranged from 1 to 5 (median, 3). Sixty-one patients required chest wall reconstruction (prostheses in 60 and bovine pericardium in 1). Operative morbidity and mortality were 44.2% and 6.3%, respectively. Sixty-five cancers were classified as T3 N0 M0, 16 as T3 N1 M0, and 14 as T3 N2 M0. Squamous cell carcinoma was present in 56 tumors, adenocarcinoma in 25, large cell carcinoma in 11, and ""other"" in 3. Follow-up was complete in 86 (96.6%) of 89 operative survivors and ranged from 1 month to 15 years (median, 19 months). Overall 5-year actuarial survival was 38.7%. Five-year survival for patients with stage IIb disease (T3 N0 M0) was 44.3% compared with only 26.3% for those with stage IIIa disease (T3 N1 M0 or T3 N2 M0, P =.0082). Women had a better 5-year survival than men (52.9% vs 31.0%, P =.0122). The best 5-year survival was observed in women with stage IIb disease (61.2%). All other variables (age, tumor size, histopathology, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, extent of operation, depth of invasion, and adjuvant therapy) did not significantly affect survival.En bloc resection of lung cancer invading the chest wall is safe but associated with significant morbidity. Long-term survival is stage and sex dependent.

Random effects meta-analyses estimated the relative risk of lung cancer in filter and plain cigarette smokers (or with most and least filter use), in lower and higher tar smokers, in ever handrolled and manufactured only smokers, and in ever black tobacco and blond tobacco only smokers. From 43 gender-specific estimates, the risk was estimated to be 36% (95% confidence interval 27% to 44%) lower in filter than in plain cigarette smokers. The reduction was evident in both genders and in different continents. It was greater, 50% (33% to 63%, n = 11 estimates), for squamous-cell carcinoma but was also evident, 20% (-6% to 39%, n = 8), for adenocarcinoma. The risk was 23% (12% to 32%, n = 22) lower for lower tar than higher tar smokers. This reduction, seen in both genders, equates to a 2% to 3% risk reduction per milligram tar per cigarette. The risk was increased by 42% (21% to 66%, n = 15) for handrolled cigarette smoking and 75% (47% to 109%, n = 12) for black tobacco cigarette smoking. These estimates did not depend critically on results from specific studies or the limited confounding adjustment in some studies. Various problems with the epidemiological evidence are discussed, including the difficulty of obtaining compatible exposure indices from each study, the inadequate reporting of data from the largest studies, the likelihood of misreporting of cigarette type, and the inadequate control for nonsmoking confounding variables. Difficulties also arise in adjusting appropriately for aspects of smoking behavior that not only may differ between those choosing to switch or not to switch to lower tar but also may change as a result of switching. The overall data clearly show, however, that lung cancer risk is affected by the type of cigarette smoked. The suggestion that the switch to low tar cigarettes has led to an increase in the smoker/nonsmoker lung cancer relative risk and in the relative frequency of adenocarcinoma versus squamous carcinoma is shown to be weakly based. Although more data are needed relating to modern very-low-tar cigarettes, the evidence is consistent with tar reduction and the switch to filter cigarettes having reduced lung cancer risk. Indeed, the meta-analysis estimates may seriously understate the risk reductions associated with lifetime smoking of low-tar filter cigarettes."Lung	Clinical	"The difference in histologic patterns of lung cancer between men and women in Taiwan may be associated with the heterogeneity in causal factors of lung cancer between the sexes. A sex- and age-matched case-control study was designed to investigate such a relationship.Cases consisted of 236 male and 291 female incident cases with newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed primary carcinoma of the lung, and were compared to one or two individually matched controls.Cigarette smoking, occupations, and previous tuberculosis history were found to independently correlate with an elevated risk of squamous/small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma for male patients. However, there was little difference in the effect of these risk factors except smoking. The use of fume extractors in the kitchen, and the habit of waiting to fry after the fumes were emitted, separately explained the majority of the attributable fraction of female squamous/small cell carcinoma (28.2%) and adenocarcinoma (47.7%). With the exception of a kitchen with fume extractors and a clinical history of tuberculosis, the environmental causal factors of lung cancer were heterogeneous between these two histologic cell groups.Our results suggested that the causal factors of lung cancer might be specific for the type of tumor concerned. The gender-specific risk factors of lung cancer could partly explain the difference in cell-type distribution between men and women."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Oxidative DNA damage and antibodies to that damage have been implicated in lung, breast, and colorectal cancer. In this observational validation study, the relationship between anti-5-hydroxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (HMdU) autoantibody (aAb) and plasma micronutrients was assessed in 140 heavy smokers by ELISA. Anti-HMdU aAbs were 50% higher in women after adjustment for cigarettes/day (CPD; P = 0.002), although men smoked more and had higher plasma cotinine levels. The women reported taking more vitamin C (P < 0.005) and had higher plasma levels of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene (P < 0.001) and cryptoxanthin (P < 0.01) than men. Neither CPD nor cotinine was associated with aAb titers. Anti-HMdU aAbs were associated inversely with alpha-tocopherol (P = 0.10), retinol (P = 0.06), and age (P = 0.04) in women but not in men. In contrast to the men, women <or=50 years of age had significantly higher aAbs than those >50 years of age (P = 0.05). Given the same duration of exposure, women had higher anti-HMdU aAbs and also reached peak levels at a lower cumulative smoking exposure (30 years) compared with male smokers (40 years). Subjects smoked an average of 28.9 +/- 0.81 CPD and initiated smoking at 17.2 +/- 0.33 (SE) years of age. Therefore, smokers who reported smoking for 30 years were typically <50 years old. Women <or=50 years in the younger age group that smoked 21-30 years had significantly higher levels of aAbs than did men of the same age and smoking history (P = 0.012). Gender difference in aAbs was also evident in 29 persons who gave serial samples before and after quitting smoking (P < 0.028). In women, aAbs remained elevated for 14 months after smoking cessation but decreased significantly by 20.5 months (P < 0.032) by paired t tests. In men, aAbs increased with time since quitting smoking but not significantly. The finding of significantly elevated aAbs to oxidized DNA in females <or=50 compared with male smokers of the same age and exposure suggests a possible interaction with hormones (e.g., estrogens) and may explain a heightened risk of smoking-induced lung cancer in women compared with men."Lung	Epidemiology	"We used the Swedish Family-Cancer Database to examine the time trends of lung cancer in Sweden by histological type, with special reference to gender. A total of 45,297 lung cancer cases were analysed. The overall age-adjusted incidence rates of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in men peaked in the 1980s and then slightly decreased, while corresponding rates in women increased steadily. The incidence of adenocarcinoma increased in both genders. The male-to-female incidence ratio for SCC was 12.4 in the 1960s and 3.6 in the 1990s. For adenocarcinoma the ratio was close to 1.5 throughout the period. Regression analysis indicated that the birth cohort of the 1940s was at the highest risk for adenocarcinoma in men and for all types of lung cancer in women. Lung cancer in parents was a risk factor for offspring. In conclusion, the data, particularly on women, suggest that modern cigarettes induce lung adenocarcinoma and SCC in a proportion of 1:0.6. This proportion was 1:3.7 among men diagnosed in the 1960s. The incidence ratio of 1.3 for adenocarcinoma between men and women in the 1990s is consistent with the smoking prevalence data a few decades ago, suggesting equal sensitivity of both genders to tobacco-induced lung cancer."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Oxidative DNA damage and antibodies to that damage have been implicated in lung, breast, and colorectal cancer.

This is the first investigation of estrogen receptor (ER) beta in human lung. Immunohistochemical staining revealed ERbeta expression in normal lung and in atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), considered as a precancerous lesion for adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinomas showed significantly higher expression of ERbeta than squamous cell carcinomas. On the contrary, ERalpha expression was not detected in all cases. The functional integrity of ERbeta such as the binding ability to estrogen responsive element (ERE) and transcriptional activity was confirmed using a human lung cancer cell line, RERF-LC-OK. Colony formation of this cell was significantly reduced in the presence of pure antiestrogen. We conclude that ERbeta, but not ERalpha, is present in lung tissues with an important physiological function in normal lung. Furthermore, ERbeta may play a role in growth and development of adenocarcinomas."Lung	Pathophysiology	"The higher frequency of human lung adenocarcinoma in females than in males, strongly suggests the involvement of gender dependent factors in the etiology of this disease.

The purpose of the present study was to assess whether these findings are reproducible, using data from the Renfrew and Paisley study.Age-standardized mortality rate differences and age-adjusted mortality rate ratios (using Cox's proportional hazard model) were calculated for male and female smokers by amount smoked compared with never smokers. These analyses were repeated after excluding non-inhalers.The all-cause mortality rate ratio was higher for men than for women in all categories of amount smoked, although this difference was only statistically significant in the light smokers (1.83 [95% CI : 1.61-2.07] for men and 1.41 [95% CI : 1.28-1.56] for women, P = 0.001). The cause-specific mortality rate ratios tended to be higher for men than for women, and this difference was most substantial for neoplasms (2.57 [95% CI : 2.01-3.29] for male light smokers and 1.35 [95% CI : 1.14-1.61] for female light smokers, P < 0.001) and, in particular, for lung cancer (11.10 [95% CI : 5.89-20.92] for male light smokers and 4.73 [95% CI : 2.99-7.50] for female light smokers, P = 0.03). Furthermore, looking at the rate differences the effects of smoking were uniformly greater in men than in women. These results were virtually unchanged after excluding non-inhalers.We found similar results to Prescott et al. when all smokers were considered, but could not reproduce their findings when non-inhalers were excluded. Given the fact that we showed greater rate differences in men than in women, we think that it is too early to conclude that women may be more sensitive than men to some of the deleterious effects of smoking."Lung	Epidemiology	"Sweden has one of the largest population-based cancer registers in the world that provides an opportunity to examine the trend of lung cancer incidence during a 35-year period. The primary aim of the present study was to estimate the effects of birth cohort, year of diagnosis (period), and age on the time trends of lung cancer incidence rates, and to analyze the gender-specific incidence of different histopathological types of lung cancer.Among men the age-standardized incidence rate increased steadily up to 1982, when a peak of 49 cases per 100,000 person-years was reached. Among women the incidence rate was lower and showed a monotonic increase throughout the observation period. The fastest rate of increase was noted among the youngest women. In women, but not in men, there was a steady increase in risk with each successive birth cohort. For both sexes there were large changes in the histopathological distributions of cases. The most notable was a major increase in adenocarcinomas.The overall age-adjusted incidence rate of lung cancer in Sweden has stabilized in men during the past two decades while rates are still increasing in women. In view of the continued high prevalence of smoking among young women, a future definite increase in the overall number of lung cancer cases in women can be expected."Lung	Outcomes	"Prescott et al. found that the relative risks associated with smoking for respiratory and vascular deaths were higher for women who inhale than for inhaling men, and found no gender differences in relative risks of smoking-related cancers.

For men, the highest percentages of excess mortality (between 40% and 60%) were found for smoking and alcohol related causes of death such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and cirrhosis while for women the highest percentages of excess mortality (between 40% and 60%) were found for diet related causes such as diabetes and ischaemic heart disease.Health inequality is a widespread phenomenon in the majority of the top leading causes of deaths of the nation. Increasing levels of deprivation indices are associated with mortality risk differently by both cause and gender. Results suggest that deprivation effects mainly captured by Index 2 may manifest largely as unfavourable health behaviours leading to gender specific sets of causes of deaths. Findings of this study are consistent with the idea that material deprivation determines health inequality through both an increase of general susceptibility to ill health, leading to excess mortality in a wide range of causes, and a set of specific factors, resulting in an increased risk of death from a specific set of causes in each gender."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in Taiwanese women. Cigarette smoking cannot explain the high lung cancer mortality in this population because less than 10% of women in Taiwan are smokers. Therefore, environmental factors other than smoking may play an important role in lung cancer development in female nonsmokers. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of environmental carcinogen exposure in lung cancer development in Taiwanese female nonsmokers, based on DNA adduct formation. We collected nontumorous lung tissues resected from 62 nonsmoking lung cancer patients and 20 noncancer controls to investigate whether differences in susceptibility to DNA adduct formation exist between men and women. (32)P-postlabeling and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with polyclonal antibody against BPDE (7,8-dihydroxy-anti-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene)-DNA adduct were used to evaluate DNA adduct levels in lung tissues of study subjects. Our data showed that the DNA adduct levels of lung cancer patients determined by both assays were significantly higher than those of noncancer controls (P = 0.0001 for (32)P-postlabeling; P = 0.01 for ELISA). Moreover, DNA adduct levels in females were markedly greater than those in males (P = 0.014 for (32)P-postlabeling; P = 0.001 for ELISA). The difference in DNA adduct levels could not be explained by genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P-4501A1 (CYP1A1) or glutathione S-transferase (GSTM1), as determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. These results demonstrate that lung cancer patients have a higher susceptibility to DNA damage than that of noncancer controls. In addition, differences in susceptibility to DNA damage derived from environmental carcinogen exposure were observed between male and female nonsmokers. In conclusion, high susceptibility to DNA damage in females may partially explain the high mortality rate of lung cancer in nonsmoking Taiwanese women."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in Taiwanese women.

Differences between cohort mortality age trajectories and the age pattern of mortality rates were related to socioeconomic differences between genders and to biological risk factors.U.S. males and females aged 30 to 95+ over the 34-year period 1962 to 1995.Gender- and age-specific mortality rates were computed and displayed using the logarithmic transform of the rates for five-year age categories.Major gender cross-sectional mortality differences were found for heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer, with males being disadvantaged except for stroke. Less variation was found for lung cancer in recent male cohorts compared to large rates of change for recent female cohorts. Female breast cancer mortality showed modest variation, with most of the cohort differential in risk in postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Relative risk of lung cancer with age was greater for females.Differences in male and female cohort mortality rates underlie many of the period changes for heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer. Cohort differences were largest for lung cancer, although the cohort-specific smoking patterns these rates imply could also be responsible for some of the heart disease and mortality differences. The breast cancer mortality rates showed consistency with the concept of two distinct etiologies for breast cancer: premenopausal and postmenopausal.

Cancer is a result of multiple gene-environment interactions occurring over several decades. During tumor development the cell accumulates multiple genetic changes, which generate the transformed phenotype, i.e. a cell with increased genetic instability. Lung cancer is a useful model for the study of the interplay between genetic factors and environmental exposure since the primary etiology is well established. Several polymorphic enzymes that may be important determinants of susceptibility have been demonstrated. Data also provide evidence for sex differences in lung cancer susceptibility. Furthermore, certain chemical carcinogens may contribute to the carcinogenic process in the lung epithelial cells by inducing genomic instability either directly or indirectly through inflammatory processes."Lung	Review	"Cigarette smoking is claiming an increasing health toll among women, with rising morbidity and mortality related to lung cancer and COPD. Whether women are more susceptible to the effects of cigarettes with regard to carcinogenesis and development of COPD remains controversial. Gender differences clearly exist in certain aspects of cigarette-related disease, including histologic distribution of lung cancer and the ability of smokers to quit. It is likely that gender differences also exist in the reasons that individuals choose to smoke. Understanding those reasons will be important in developing targeted programs for smoking cessation and in addressing the challenge of the prevention of smoking initiation in women."Lung	Review	"Cigarette smoking is claiming an increasing health toll among women, with rising morbidity and mortality related to lung cancer and COPD.

Women were younger (60.7+/-0.8 versus 63.6+/-0.6 years; p = 0.005). Adenocarcinoma was more common among women (48% versus 40%; p = 0.001). Pathologic stages for men were: I = 43%, II = 26%, IIIA = 25%, IIIB or IV = 6%, and for women: I = 52%, II = 20%, IIIA = 22%, IIIB or IV = 6% (p = 0.146). Median survival was better for women (41.8 versus 26.9 months; p = 0.006). This was due both to a difference in stage at presentation and to a better median survival rate for adenocarcinoma compared with squamous cell cancer. The data suggest an association between sex and survival, although this failed to reach statistical significance. Sex influenced survival with a relative risk for women of 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.35 to 1.29; p = 0.231 adjusted for stage, cell type, age, and spirometry).There are sex-associated differences in the presentation and possibly in the survival of patients with lung cancer. This finding has possible implications regarding the selection of patients for therapy and for the design of randomized therapeutic trials."Lung	Management	"To characterize gender differences in lung cancer, we conducted a retrospective analysis including all patients undergoing surgery for non-small cell lung carcinoma in a single institution over a 20-year period.Compared with men (n = 839), women (n = 198) were more likely to be asymptomatic (32% vs 20%, P =.006), nonsmokers (27% vs 2%, P <.001), or light smokers (31 pack-years vs 52 pack-years; P <.001). Squamous cell carcinoma predominated in men (65%), and adenocarcinoma predominated in women (54%). Preoperative bronchoscopy contributed more frequently to a histologic diagnosis in men (69% vs 49% in women, P <.001), and fewer pneumonectomies were performed in women (22% vs 32% in men, P =.01). After multivariate Cox regression analysis, women survived longer than men (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0. 92; P =.009) independently of age, presence of symptoms, smoking habits, type of operation, histologic characteristics, and stage of disease. The protective effect linked to female sex was present in early-stage carcinoma (stage I and II) and absent in more advanced-stage carcinoma (stage III and IV).This study emphasizes strong sex differences in presentation, management, and prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer."Lung	Epidemiology	"Several studies in the past have shown appreciably higher lung cancer risk estimates associated with smoking exposure among men than among women, while more recent studies in the USA report just the opposite. To evaluate this topic in a European population we conducted a case-control study of lung cancer in three German and three Italian centres. Personal interviews and standardized questionnaires were used to obtain detailed life-long smoking and occupational histories from 3723 male and 900 female cases and 4075 male and 1094 female controls. Lung cancer risk comparing ever-smokers with never-smokers was higher among men (odds ratios (OR) adjusted for age and centre = 16.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 12.8-20.3) than among women (OR = 4.2, CI 3.5-5.1). Because the smoking habits of women were different from men, we conducted more detailed analyses using comparable levels of smoking exposure. After restriction to smokers and adjustment for other smoking variables, risk estimates did not differ appreciably between genders. The analysis of duration of smoking (0-19, 20-39, 40+ years) adjusted for cigarette consumption and time since quitting smoking revealed similar risk estimates in men (OR = 1.0, 3.3 [CI 2.6-4.2], 4.1 [CI 3.1-5.6]) and women (OR = 1.0, 2.7 [CI 1.7-4.1], 3.3 [CI 1.9-5.8]). The same was true of the analysis of average or cumulative smoking consumption, and also of analyses stratified by different histological types. We conclude that for comparable exposure to tobacco smoke, the risk of lung cancer is comparable in women and men."Lung	Clinical	"Several studies in the past have shown appreciably higher lung cancer risk estimates associated with smoking exposure among men than among women, while more recent studies in the USA report just the opposite.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale data and QOL items from the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist were analyzed, together with relevant demographic and clinical factors.Depression was self-rated in 322 patients (33%) before treatment and persisted in more than 50% of patients. SCLC patients had a three-fold greater prevalence of case depression than those with NSCLC (25% v 9%; P <.0001). An increased rate for women was found for good performance status (PS) patients (PS of 0 or 1) but the sex difference reduced for poor PS patients (PS of 3 or 4) because of increased depression rates for men (chi(2) for trend, P <.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that functional impairment was the most important risk factor; depression increased by 41% for each increment on the impairment scale. Pretreatment physical symptom burden, fatigue, and clinician-rated PS were also independent predictors, but cell type was not.Depression is common and persistent in lung cancer patients, especially those with more severe symptoms or functional limitations.

Peripheral tumors were significantly more common in women than men (71.8% vs 50.6%, respectively). Among 686 patients with a history of smoking, the women smoked significantly less often (12.8% vs 91.4% for men). Complete resection was achieved significantly less often in women (79.6% vs 85.2% for men); however, women having complete resection survived significantly longer than their male counterparts. Women with a postoperative negative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) had a significantly better prognosis than men; however, women with a postoperative positive CEA did not. Women > or = 60 years old survived significantly longer than their male counterparts, while women < 60 years old did not.Once the tumor was resected completely, women survived longer, partly due to the influence of life expectancy. However, the incidence of malignant effusion was higher and the rate of complete resection was lower in women."Lung	Pathophysiology	"In contrast to men, the incidence of lung cancer among women has increased over the past decade. The basis for this increase among female smokers remains unknown. Surgical patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer and control subjects without a history of malignancy completed a smoking questionnaire and donated a blood sample. DNA was extracted from peripheral mononuclear cells and genotyped for polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) (exon 7) and glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) (null). No gender differences in either age at diagnosis or histological subtype were observed among lung cancer patients. In both patients (n = 180) and controls (n = 163), females smoked significantly less than males. The pack-year history associated with adenocarcinoma was smaller than that for squamous cell carcinoma. No significant association was observed between the GSTM1 null genotype and cancer risk. However, women had a larger cancer risk than men (odds ratio 4.98 vs. 1.37) if they possessed the mutant CYP1A1 genotype. Female cancer patients were significantly more likely than female controls to have both the CYP1A1 mutation and GSTM1 null genotype. The combined variant genotypes conferred an odds ratio of 6.54 for lung cancer in women versus 2.36 for men, independent of age or smoking history. These data suggest that polymorphisms in CYP1A1 and GSTM1 contribute to the increased risk of females for lung cancer."Lung	Pathophysiology	"In contrast to men, the incidence of lung cancer among women has increased over the past decade.

Previous studies have shown that the frequency of p53 mutations is significantly higher in small cell lung cancer than in non-small cell lung cancer. However, this conclusion was based in large part on data derived from tumor cell lines and from studies with relatively small sample sizes and biased gender populations. To determine the mutational frequency in the p53 tumor suppressor gene and a potential difference in gender, we analyzed primary small cell lung cancer tumors from 65 patients (37 males and 28 females) for p53 mutations between exons 5 and 9. Mutations were found in 37 of 65 tumors (57%) within the region of p53 analyzed. Interestingly, none of the tumors from females contained more than one mutation, whereas four of the tumors from males contained more than one mutation. The most common mutation in this population was an adenosine-to-guanine transition (27%), followed by guanine-to-thymidine transversion (17%) and guanine-to-adenosine transition (12%). The gender difference in p53 mutational rate identified in this study suggests that a higher proportion of female tumors may develop through pathways not involving p53 mutations."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been demonstrated to be one of the most frequent genetic abnormalities in human cancers.

Data on smoking habits in 1963 from a random sample of 56,000 men and women were linked with information on new cases of cancer for 1964-89. Compared with people who have never smoked, the relative risks of lung cancer at different levels of pack-years completed in 1963 (>5, 6-15, 16-25 and 25 + pack-years) were 1.6, 4.4, 14.2, and 17.9 for men, and 2.1, 6.3, 10.3, and 16.5 for women. The corresponding relative risks of other smoking-related cancers were 1.8, 3.0 5.4, and 6.4 for men, and 2.0, 3.1, 5.0, and 6.5 for women. These results suggest that men and women have similar relative risks of smoking-related cancers at different levels of smoking."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Several epidemiological studies have indicated that female tobacco smokers may be at higher risk of lung cancer than males. In a study of lung cancer cases, we have found that female smokers had a significantly higher level of aromatic/hydrophobic DNA adducts in their nontumor lung tissue (15.39+/-9.47 adducts/10(8) nucleotides, n = 29) than male smokers (12.08+/-8.14, a = 93; P = 0.047). Females had significantly higher levels of adducts/pack-year (females 0.95+/-0.82 adducts/pack-year and males 0.46+/-0.46; P = 0.0004) and adducts/cigaret/day (females 1.48+/-1.29 and males 0.89+/-0.74, P = 0.015). By quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, it was found that female smokers exhibited a significantly higher expression level of lung CYP1A1 (494+/-334 CYP1A1 mRNA/10(6) glyceraldehyde-3-phophate dehydrogenase mRNA, n = 15) compared with males (210+/-208, n = 12; P = 0.016). Furthermore, for both sexes combined a significant correlation between CYP1A1 expression and DNA adduct level was found (r = 0.50, P = 0.009). In conclusion, the observed sex difference in aromatic/hydrophobic DNA adduct levels may at least in part be explained by different levels of CYP1A1 expression."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Several epidemiological studies have indicated that female tobacco smokers may be at higher risk of lung cancer than males.

This group of female workers is of particular interest, however, since they may experience exposure to several potential agricultural hazards.A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in five Italian rural areas to examine the association between cancer and farming among women. The areas selected were located in three different regions (i.e., Piedmont, Tuscany, and Emilia-Romagna). The following cancer sites were selected for the study: stomach, colon, rectum, lung, skin melanoma, skin non-melanoma, breast, cervix and corpus uteri, ovary, bladder, kidney. Cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were also included. Altogether, 1,044 newly diagnosed cases aged 20-75 years were ascertained from hospital records from March 1990 to September 1992, and for 945 of them detailed information was collected by a standard questionnaire. The analyses of data were performed comparing each case series to a reference group drawn from among the other sites. Unconditional logistic regression models were used in the statistical analyses.Statistically significant increased risks in association with farming were estimated for skin melanoma (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-5.8) and bladder cancer (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.1). Lung cancer was also found increased but not at a statistically significant level (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.7-4.4). An OR lower than unity was observed for postmenopausal breast cancer (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.7).The present study suggests that women in farming might experience increased risk of cancers, not usually found in excess among male farmers, as well as a protective effect for postmenopausal breast cancer. The role of different patterns of exposure or gender specific responses should be considered in further studies."Lung	Epidemiology	"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in North American women. Because smoking-related changes in the bronchial epithelium and in lung function have not been studied in detail in women, we used fluorescence bronchoscopy-directed biopsy to determine the prevalence of high-grade preinvasive lesions in former and current smokers of both sexes.Spirometry, white-light bronchoscopy, and fluorescence bronchoscopy were performed in 189 women and 212 men older than 40 years of age who had smoked 20 pack-years or more (pack-years = number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day x number of years of smoking).Carcinoma in situ was found in 1.8% of the subjects, severe dysplasia was found in 6.5%, and moderate dysplasia was found in 14% (all preinvasive lesions). Compared with men, women had a lower prevalence of high-grade preinvasive lesions in the observed airways (14% versus 31%; odds ratio = 0.18; 95% confidence interval = 0.04-0.88), and women with preinvasive lesions had fewer such lesions (two-sided P = .048). The prevalence of preinvasive lesions did not change substantially for more than 10 years after cessation of smoking. Lung function was associated with the prevalence of preinvasive lesions, but the association was weaker in women than in men. If the presence of airflow obstruction was defined by an FEV1/FVC (forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity) value of 70% or less, only 56% of the men and 44% of the women with preinvasive lesions had abnormal lung function.In developing strategies for chemoprevention or early detection of lung cancer in high-risk populations, it is important to consider the effect of sex and arbitrarily chosen lung function values on the prevalence of preinvasive airway lesions."Lung	Clinical	"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in North American women.

Studies comparing hazards associated with smoking in women and men based on a sufficient number of heavy smokers of both genders are lacking.We used pooled data from three prospective population studies conducted in Copenhagen to compare total and cause-specific mortality in relation to smoking habits. A total of 30917 subjects, 44% women, with initial examinations between 1964 and 1992 were followed until 1994 for date and cause of death.During follow up, 2900 women and 5744 men died. Smoking characteristics differed considerably with gender, particularly in the older subjects. Overall mortality rates in smokers were approximately twice those in people who never smoked. Positive associations with smoking in both men and women were confirmed for all-cause mortality as well as mortality from respiratory disease, vascular disease, lung cancer, and other tobacco-related cancers. Despite large gender differences in age at smoking debut, total and cause-specific relative mortality in smokers was similar in men and women. After excluding non-inhalers, relative risks associated with smoking for respiratory and vascular disease were higher for women than men whereas there were no gender differences in smoking related risk of cancers.The relative risks suggest that women may be more sensitive than men to some of the deleterious effects of smoking. However, because of lower baseline mortality rates in women, rate differences may be similar and results should be interpreted with caution."Lung	Epidemiology	"Mortality from smoking-related diseases in women is increasing worldwide.

A total of 30917 subjects, 44% women, with initial examinations between 1964 and 1992 were followed until 1994 for date and cause of death.During follow up, 2900 women and 5744 men died. Smoking characteristics differed considerably with gender, particularly in the older subjects. Overall mortality rates in smokers were approximately twice those in people who never smoked. Positive associations with smoking in both men and women were confirmed for all-cause mortality as well as mortality from respiratory disease, vascular disease, lung cancer, and other tobacco-related cancers. Despite large gender differences in age at smoking debut, total and cause-specific relative mortality in smokers was similar in men and women. After excluding non-inhalers, relative risks associated with smoking for respiratory and vascular disease were higher for women than men whereas there were no gender differences in smoking related risk of cancers.The relative risks suggest that women may be more sensitive than men to some of the deleterious effects of smoking. However, because of lower baseline mortality rates in women, rate differences may be similar and results should be interpreted with caution."Lung	Epidemiology	"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of long-term concentrations of ambient air pollutants and risk of incident lung cancer in nonsmoking California adults. A cohort study of 6,338 nonsmoking, non-Hispanic, white Californian adults, ages 27-95, was followed from 1977 to 1992 for newly diagnosed cancers. Monthly ambient air pollution data were interpolated to zip code centroids according to home and work location histories, cumulated, and then averaged over time. The increased relative risk (RR) of incident lung cancer in males associated with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in 100 ppb ozone (O3) was 3.56 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.35-9.42]. Incident lung cancer in males was also positively associated with IQR increases for mean concentrations of particulate matter <10 microm (PM10; RR = 5.21; CI, 1.94-13.99) and SO2 (RR = 2.66; CI, 1.62-4.39). For females, incident lung cancer was positively associated with IQR increases for SO2 (RR = 2.14; CI, 1.36-3.37) and IQR increases for PM10 exceedance frequencies of 50 microg/m3 (RR = 1.21; CI, 0.55-2.66) and 60 microg/m3 (RR = 1.25; CI, 0.57-2.71). Increased risks of incident lung cancer were associated with elevated long-term ambient concentrations of PM10 and SO2 in both genders and with O3 in males. The gender differences for the O3 and PM10 results appeared to be partially due to gender differences in exposure."Lung	Epidemiology	"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of long-term concentrations of ambient air pollutants and risk of incident lung cancer in nonsmoking California adults.

Misasa town was divided into an elevated radon level area and a control area, with mean indoor radon levels of about 60 and 20 Bq/m3, respectively. In total, 3,083 subjects in the elevated radon level area and 1,248 in the control area, all aged 40 or older on January 1, 1976, were followed up until December 31, 1993, for a mean period of 14 years. The mortality rates from all causes exhibited no difference between the elevated radon level area and the control area for both sexes. No difference was observed in the incidence of all-site cancers (age, period-adjusted rate ratios by Poisson regression, RR = 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-1.42 for males, RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.65-1.24 for females), while stomach cancer incidence seemed to decrease for both sexes (RR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.44-1.11 for male, RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.34-1.00 for female) and lung cancer incidence for males only seemed to increase (RR = 1.65, 95% CI 0.83-3.30 for male, RR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.28-4.14 for female) in the elevated radon level area. Caution is needed in the interpretation of these findings, however, since the individual exposure level was not measured and major confounding factors, such as smoking and diet, could not be controlled in this study."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Estrogen-dependent intracellular processes are important in the growth regulation of normal tissue and may play a role in the regulation of malignancies. Utilization of estrogen receptor assays in breast carcinoma is well established, but the role of such evaluation in other cancers largely is unknown. In this study, immunohistochemical expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and the ER-related protein p29 was correlated with survival of patients with nonsmall cell carcinoma of the lung.All patients with a tissue diagnosis of primary nonsmall cell bronchogenic carcinoma diagnosed over a 6-year period at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont were reviewed. Assays for p29 and ER using a streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method were performed on each tumor. Results were correlated with clinical data, including survival.Of 111 tumors examined, 109 (98%) were positive for p29 whereas none of the tumors reacted with ER (ER1D5). The relation between p29 expression and survival time was different for men and women. A statistically significant negative relation for women was observed; this relation was most pronounced in patients with Stage I and II tumors. A positive but not statistically significant relation was observed for men.The ER-related protein p29 commonly is expressed in nonsmall cell carcinomas of the lung. The relation between p29 and survival time is different for males and females, suggesting the presence of gender specific factors that may influence tumor growth and overall patient survival, especially in patients with early stage lung carcinoma."Lung	Epidemiology	"This study assesses whether deprived populations living close to industry experience greater mortality from lung cancer than populations with comparable socioeconomic characteristics living farther away. Mortality data, census data, a postal survey of living circumstances, historic and contemporary data on air quality and a historic land-use survey were used. Analysis was based on two conurbations in England, Teesside and Sunderland. Housing estates in Teesside were selected based on socioeconomic criteria and distinguished by proximity to steel and chemical industries; they were grouped into three zones: near (A), intermediate (B), and farther (C), with a single zone in Sunderland. We included 14,962 deaths in 27 estates. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for lung cancer [International Classification of Diseases #9 (ICD-9) 162] and cancers other than lung (ICD-9 140-239, excluding 162), and sex ratios were calculated. Mortality from lung cancer was well above national levels in all zones. For men, a weak gradient corresponding with proximity to industry at younger ages reversed at older ages. In women 0-64 years of age, stronger gradients in lung cancer mortality corresponded with proximity to industry across zones A, B, and C (SMR = 393, 251, 242, respectively). Overall rates in Teesside were higher than Sunderland rates for women aged 0-64 years (SMR = 287 vs. 185) and 65-74 years (SMR = 190 vs. 157). The association between raised lung cancer mortality and proximity to industry in women under 75 years of age could not be explained by smoking, occupation, socioeconomic factors, or artifact. Explanations for differences between men and women may include gender-specific occupational experiences and smoking patterns. Our judgment is that the observed gradient in women points to a role for industrial air pollution."Lung	Epidemiology	"To investigate factors related to lung cancer mortality in six Arizona copper smelter towns, we identified 185 lung cancer cases and two matched controls per case from decedent residents during 1979-1990. Detailed information on lifetime residential, occupational, and smoking history was obtained by structured telephone interviews with knowledgeable informants. Interviews were completed for 82% of 183 eligible cases and 88% of the targeted number (366) of controls. Estimated historical environmental exposures to smelter emissions, based on atmospheric diffusion modeling of measured SO2 concentrations, were linked with residential histories to derive individual profiles of residential exposure. Occupational histories were characterized by potential exposure to smelter emissions, asbestos, and ionizing radiation. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare study factors in cases and controls with adjustment for potential confounding factors: gender, Hispanic ethnicity, and smoking. In overall and gender-specific analyses, no statistically significant associations were observed between lung cancer risk and any of the measures of residential exposure to smelter emissions considered (town of residence at time of death, highest level of exposure, and duration or cumulative exposure above background levels), or any of the estimated occupational exposures (definite or potential asbestos, potential ionizing radiation, definite or potential smelter). Among male residents of some, but not all, towns, there was some evidence of a positive association between lung cancer risk and reported copper smelter-related employment (reported as definite), with the highest risk observed for Miami, Arizona. This study provided little evidence of a positive association between lung cancer mortality and residential exposure to smelter emissions. Specific factors associated with the apparent heterogeneity in lung cancer risk across study towns cannot be identified in this community-based study."Lung	Epidemiology	"As part of the ITACARE project, the present study analyzed and compared population-based data on the survival of adult cancer patients in Italy, according to sex, age, period of diagnosis and geographical area.Nine Italian population-based cancer registries provided data on all their cancer patients (total 90,431 cases) followed for at least 5 years and diagnosed during the period 1978-1989. About 10% of the Italian population is covered by these registries. The data was analyzed by means of a multivariate model.The major findings were that there was a general improvement in 5-year relative survival over the study period (from 33% to 39%) and that there were significant differences in survival between different areas of the country, particularly for cancer sites which respond well to treatment. In general, the area covered by the Ragusa (Sicily) registry was characterized by significantly worse survival than other registry populations. Other important findings were that for all malignant cancer sites 5-year relative survival decreased with age from 50% for the youngest age class (15-44 years) to 27% for the oldest age class (75+ years) and that women have a better prognosis for most cancer sites (overall 5-year relative survival in women 48% vs 32% in men).The significant regional differences in survival may reflect unequal provision of care, particularly between northern-central Italy and the south. The reasons for the general survival improvement with time are not completely understood, whereas the marked overall sex difference is related to the fact that the commonest cancer in women (breast cancer) is eminently more treatable than the commonest malignancy in men (lung cancer). The unfavorable trend with increasing age may be due to increasing difficulty in applying complete therapy protocols as general health declines, sometimes in relation to an advanced cancer stage at diagnosis."Lung	Clinical	"This study investigated differences in physical functioning and physical role limitations according to cancer site and treatment modality in a sample of 590 patients 65 years and older diagnosed with breast, colon, lung or prostate cancer. Analysis of covariance procedures were utilised to test for differences in levels of physical functioning and physical role limitations according to cancer site and treatment modality, adjusting for differences in age, comorbid conditions and retrospective physical functioning. Physical functioning and physical role limitations were measured using two subscales of the Medical Outcomes Studies MOS 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Physical functioning prior to diagnosis, and to a lesser degree comorbidity, contributed significantly to current levels of physical functioning and physical role limitations. Patients with lung cancer reported lower physical functioning and physical role limitation scores than patients with prostate cancer, and patients treated with surgery only reported lower physical functioning and physical role limitation scores than patients treated with neither surgery nor radiation. No gender differences were observed among the reduced sample consisting of patients with colon or lung cancer. It is important not only that physicians and oncologists are cognizant of the fact that some cancers (particularly lung cancer) may be more physically debilitating than others, but that the patient's history of comorbid conditions and pre-existing physical limitations may be important factors in predicting current physical functioning."Lung	Epidemiology	"In this case-control study we determined whether dietary differences underlie some of the ethnic and sex differences in US lung cancer rates. We examined the relationship between diet and lung cancer development in 137 lung cancer cases (93 African Americans and 44 Mexican Americans) and 187 controls (78 African Americans and 109 Mexican Americans). Cases reported a higher daily mean total fat intake (p < 0.001), whereas controls had a higher daily mean intake of dietary fiber (p < 0.001) and fruits (p = 0.02). Ethnic differences in diet were also observed: Mexican Americans consumed less total fat (p < 0.02) and more fiber (p < 0.001) and vegetables (p = 0.08) than African Americans. Additionally, men consumed more total fat (p = 0.08) and less fiber (p = 0.001), fruits (p < 0.001), and vegetables (p = 0.002) than women. Multivariable analysis, after adjustment for the effects of pack-years of smoking, age, total energy intake, sex, and ethnicity, demonstrated a positive association between high total fat consumption and lung cancer risk (p < 0.01) and an inverse association between high fruit consumption and lung cancer risk (p = 0.05). In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that diet, particularly high fat consumption and low fruit and vegetable consumption, contributes (independent of cigarette smoking) to the excess lung cancer risk in African-American men, who have the highest lung cancer rates in the United States."Lung	Epidemiology	"What jobs are associated with the highest and lowest levels of cigarette use and of lung cancer? Are there gender differences in these jobs? Two data sets-the Epidemiological Follow-up to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHEFS) and the California Occupational Mortality Study (COMS) were analyzed to answer these questions. For females, the broad occupations ranking from highest to lowest cigarette use in the NHEFS was: transportation operators, managers, craft workers, service workers, operatives, laborers, technicians, administrative workers, farm owners and workers, sales workers, no occupation, and professionals. The corresponding ranking for males was: transportation operators, no occupation, laborers, craft workers, service workers, technicians, and professionals. The highest-ranking jobs in the COMS were waitresses, telephone operators, and cosmetologists for women, and water-transportation workers, roofers, foresters and loggers for men. Teachers were especially low on all four lists. This study could not determine whether employment within any occupation encouraged smoking or if smokers selected certain occupations."Lung	Epidemiology	"What jobs are associated with the highest and lowest levels of cigarette use and of lung cancer?

We have investigated gender differences in the p53 mutational spectrum and levels of hydrophobic DNA adducts. Tumour tissue was obtained from 115 non-small cell lung cancer tumours and examined for mutational alterations in the p53 gene (exons 4-9) using PCR and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis. We have previously examined exons 5-8 in lung cancer. Sequence analysis of exons 4 and 9 revealed that almost 20% of the mutations were located in exons 4 and 9. The levels of hydrophobic DNA adducts in non-tumorous lung tissue of 55 of the patients were analyzed by the 32P-postlabelling assay. There were both a higher frequency of G:C-->T:A mutations and a higher average hydrophobic DNA adduct level in females than in male patients, even though the level of exposure to carcinogens from cigarette smoking was lower among the females than among the males. Frameshift mutations were more common in women than in men (30 versus 15%). These preliminary findings lend support to epidemiological evidence that women may be at greater risk than men of contracting tobacco-induced lung cancer."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Human lung cancer exhibits a high frequency of transversion mutations at G:C base pairs of the p53 gene, possibly the result of DNA damage by cigarette smoke constituents, most notably benzo[a]pyrene.

However, tobacco consumption dropped by 35% in Canada during the 1980s.Using data collected during a Quebec health survey, we evaluated the prevalences of tobacco use by birth cohort. Since mortality has been decreasing for both sexes, we computed gender-specific cohort mortality indices for tobacco-related causes of death. In the analysis, we took into account the inevitable time lag between adopting the behavior and becoming the victim of a smoking-attributable disease.Results indicate a systematic decrease in tobacco use from older male cohorts to younger ones across all ages; however, for females an increase in tobacco use has been observed from one cohort to the next but there seems to be hope for a future trend toward breaking the habit. While a decline in tobacco-related mortality has been observed among men (e.g., death from ischemic heart disease), female lung cancer mortality increased considerably. Finally, we present an indicator measuring the years of potential life lost for some tobacco-related causes of death.The cohort approach allows us to observe birth-cohort-specific trends, thereby more easily relating past behavior to current mortality levels. In terms of prevention, increasing female mortality from lung cancer should become a major concern and a motivator in the fight against tobacco use."Lung	Outcomes	"Gender has recently emerged as a discriminating factor in nonsmall lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patient outcome. Since the potential for interaction among established prognostic factors and gender in this common disease has not been explored, the authors evaluated the role of gender and weight-loss pattern in predicting clinical outcome in a balanced population of men and women presenting with NSCLC.From a tumor registry population of 368 NSCLC patients, a gender-balanced sample of 152 cases was randomly selected for review, using prospective inclusion criteria. Study parameters were age, race, tobacco and alcohol history, gender, weight-loss pattern, histology, TNM stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and therapy. Influences of study variables on Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were subsequently determined using univariate and multivariate analyses.Overall median survival after diagnosis was significantly shorter for men with NSCLC than for women with the disease (40 vs. 78 weeks, P = 0.001). Men lost significantly more weight over their disease course than women (12.2 vs. 5.4 pounds, P = 0.006) and experienced an eightfold faster rate of initial weight loss (0.25 vs. 0.03 pounds per week, P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the strongest independent predictors of NSCLC patient survival were stage of disease, initial weight-loss rate, and gender (all P < 0.0001).These results suggest that weight loss may play a role in mediating gender-related differences in NSCLC patient survival and provide an impetus for further studies of gender influence on cancer outcome."Lung	Outcomes	"Gender has recently emerged as a discriminating factor in nonsmall lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patient outcome.

Trends in smoking prevalence suggest that, while the prevalence in men increased earlier than women, more male smokers have quit than their female counterparts. These trends in smoking prevalence suggest striking gender differences in a period effect for the smoking prevalence. Estimates of the proportion of current smokers, ex-smokers, and the mean duration of smoking were used in a model for the lung cancer incidence rates. The form for the relationship between smoking history and the incidence rate for these subgroups was based on information from cohort studies. The models represented a mixture of the smoking subgroups where the effect of smoking was considered to be either a multiplicative effect on the underlying age distribution, or a separate effect in which the level of exposure was the sole contribution to risk among smokers. The multiplicative model explained more than 80 per cent of the deviance for the period and cohort effects, while the non-multiplicative model could only account for trends in females. Hence, these results suggest that a sizeable portion of the period and cohort contributions to the lung cancer incidence trends in Connecticut can be attributed to the multiplicative model that utilizes this smoking information, although the lack of more detailed information is a limiting factor in developing the model."Lung	Epidemiology	"Population based data on smoking history derived from NCHS surveys were used to develop a model for lung cancer incidence in Connecticut.

The addition of total parenteral nutrition to chemotherapy in early trials was associated with survival detriment. Dietary counseling and enteral supplement use are common strategies that, when evaluated in randomized trials, do not improve anthropometrics or clinical outcome in lung cancer. Pharmacologic agents including corticosteroids, cyproheptadine, growth hormone, hydrazine sulfate, dronabinol, and pentoxyphylline also have failed to improve even anthropometric parameters in this condition. Megestrol acetate use is associated with appetite stimulation and non-fluid weight gain but, when evaluated in small cell lung cancer patients receiving defined chemotherapy, failed to improve global quality of life, and survival and was associated with toxicity. New strategies for nutrition-based interventions in lung cancer cachexia must consider their potential influence on tumor growth as well as on nutritional status. Recent lung cancer prognostic analyses have identified gender differences in outcome and weight loss that suggest potential targets for combined hormonal and nutrition interventions. Emerging information regarding the influence of specific fatty acids on tumor growth and cachexia development have identified additional approaches for future evaluation."Lung	Review	"Successful lung cancer management has been hindered by the limited efficacy of dietary and pharmacologic interventions to prevent or reverse cancer-associated weight loss.

This increase in U.S. women exceeds that expected from a slower decline of smoking among women. Recent epidemiologic and biochemical studies suggest gender differences in susceptibility to tobacco carcinogens.We conducted an up-to-date, more in-depth evaluation of our earlier observation of a potential gender difference in relative risk (RR) of lung cancer due to smoking. We added information from several additional case and control subjects and included more precise histologic classification of the cancer type, accurate quantitation of smoke exposure, and adjustments for body size.The present investigation was a part of an ongoing hospital-based, case-control study by the American Health Foundation. It included data from 1889 case subjects (1108 males and 781 females) with lung cancer of squamous/epidermoid, small-cell/oat cell, large-cell, and adenocarcinoma types and 2070 control subjects (1122 males and 948 females) with diseases unrelated to smoking. The case and control subjects were admitted to participating hospitals from 1981 to 1994 and were pair-matched by age, sex, hospital, and the time of hospital admission. Ex-smokers and non-Caucasians were excluded from analyses to avoid confounding. The RRs and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from adjusted odds ratios (ORs) by use of unconditional multiple logistic regression analysis, and statistical significance was determined by two-sided tests. The ORs for major histologic types were estimated at increasing levels of exposure to cigarette smoke.Our results indicated that women were more likely to be never-smokers than men, particularly those with the squamous/epidermoid-type cancer (8.3% for women versus 2.9% for men 55 years old or older). Men started smoking earlier, reported inhaling more deeply, and smoked more cigarettes per day than women. In contrast, dose-response ORs over cumulative exposure to cigarette smoking were 1.2-fold to 1.7-fold higher in women than in men for the three major histologic types; these differences were more pronounced for small-cell/oat cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas than for squamous/epidermoid carcinomas. Adjustments for weight, height, or body mass index did not alter the ORs.These results confirm our earlier finding that the ORs for major lung cancer types are consistently higher for women than for men at every level of exposure to cigarette smoke. Furthermore, this gender difference cannot be explained by differences in base-line exposure, smoking history, or body size, but it is likely due to the higher susceptibility to tobacco carcinogens in women."Lung	Clinical	"Lung cancer incidence is gradually leveling off in U.S. men but is continuing to rise in U.S. women.

Furthermore, this gender difference cannot be explained by differences in base-line exposure, smoking history, or body size, but it is likely due to the higher susceptibility to tobacco carcinogens in women."Lung	Review	"Female lung cancer death rates increased by more than 550 percent between 1950 and 1991. In 1986 lung cancer surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. The lung cancer epidemic is primarily attributable to cigarette smoking, which is responsible for at least 80% of the disease in women. There are gender differences in the distribution of lung cancer by histologic type, even controlling for smoking, and some data suggest greater female than male susceptibility to lung cancer at a given level of smoking. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increases risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking women. Family history of lung cancer, personal history of lung disease (e.g. asthma, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, or tuberculosis), and a history of radiotherapy also appear to be associated with increased risk. Data specific to women on the role of household radon exposures or of specific occupational or environmental exposures are relatively sparse and inconsistent. Finally, many studies have reported a decreased risk of lung cancer in individuals who consume high levels of fruits and vegetables; however, clinical trials fail to support a beneficial effect of beta-carotene supplementation. Since cigarette smoking accounts for the vast majority of lung cancer cases in women, efforts to prevent adolescent girls from starting to smoke and to encourage cessation among established smokers have the greatest potential for reducing the female lung cancer burden."Lung	Review	"Female lung cancer death rates increased by more than 550 percent between 1950 and 1991.

We initiated an investigation of the role of gender in pulmonary carcinogenesis by analysis of p53 mutations, immunohistochemistry, serum antibodies and c-erbB-2 expression in a series of 63 male and 44 female lung cancer patients whose tumors were resected at the Mayo Clinic between 1991 and 1992. There were 102 smokers and 5 never smoked. Adenocarcinoma was the more frequent histological type in women (62%) than in men (41%). Sequence analysis of exons 5-8 in 42 females and 49 males identified 44 p53 mutations in 42 tumors (46%). Base substitution mutations showed a preponderance of G:C-->T:A transversions, which were more frequent in women than men (40 versus 25%) and in individuals exposed to asbestos. c-erbB-2 immunohistochemical staining was identified more frequently in females (nine cases) than males (two cases). Marked immunohistochemical staining for p53 positively correlated with the presence of missense mutations in exons 5-8 (81%, P < 0.001). Seven missense mutations (four in exon 5, two in exon 6, one in exon 8) were identified in five of nine patients who had serum antibodies recognizing p53; tumors from these patients were also strongly positive for p53 by immunohistochemistry. These and other results indicate gender differences in the genetic and biochemical alterations in lung cancer and generate hypothesis regarding gender differences in lung cancer susceptibility."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis in women.

Because the prognostic relevance of p53 immunostaining in lung cancer is still under debate, we studied the expression pattern and clinical significance of such staining in 73 patients with operable non-small-cell lung cancer. p53 expression was detected on frozen sections with the use of monoclonal antibody p1801, which recognizes both the wild-type and mutant gene product (alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase method). A tumor was considered p53 positive if more than 1% of the tumor cells were stained. The p53 expression pattern was compared with clinicopathologic parameters, and analysis of follow-up, based on the data of 65 patients, was done by a log rank test (median observation time, 780 days). Nuclear p53 staining was detected in 33 of 73 non-small-cell lung cancers (45.2%). Comparison with clinicopathologic parameters demonstrated that the p53 protein was detected more frequently in younger patients (younger than 50 years, p = 0.014), whereas no correlation was found with sex, tumor differentiation, tumor histologic type, or TNM stage. Surprisingly, follow-up analysis revealed that p53 staining was associated with an increased rate of disease-free survival, especially in patients with early stage tumor disease (p = 0.004) and in male patients (p = 0.023). Counter to previous studies in other solid tumors, immunocytochemical detection of p53 expression does not predict a poor clinical outcome in non-small-cell lung cancer. In early-stage lung cancer it might be associated with an improved disease-free survival, which suggests that the majority of the detected protein inherits the wild-type tumor suppressor function."Lung	Epidemiology	"Information concerning tobacco smoking was obtained in a survey of 16,483 students aged 18-30 years from 21 European countries. Belief in the benefits to health of not smoking were also assessed. Risk awareness was measured in terms of knowledge of the links between smoking and disease. The overall age-adjusted prevalence of smoking was 33.1% in men and 29.0% in women, but wide variations were observed across country samples. Significant sex differences were found in only a minority of cases. The inclusion of respondents who stated that they had sometimes smoked in the past substantially reduced variations in prevalence across country samples. Beliefs in the health benefits of not smoking were consistently associated with smoking behaviour. Awareness of the link between smoking and lung cancer was uniformly high, but awareness of the role of smoking in heart disease varied considerably across country samples, and averaged only 64.4% in men and 62.9% in women. In the majority of countries, risk awareness was greater among smokers than non-smokers. The results suggest that in this selected sector of the population of young adults in Europe, sex differences in smoking are relatively minor, robust associations between attitudes and smoking behaviour can be identified, and there are major gaps in risk awareness."Lung	Clinical	"Information concerning tobacco smoking was obtained in a survey of 16,483 students aged 18-30 years from 21 European countries.

Poisson's log-linear regression model revealed that the mortality in both sexes depended significantly on three time factors: age, year of birth and historical period. The dependence of mortality on the above factors was analyzed by Osmond-Gardner's method. The mortality increased in both sexes with age. The risk of death in male generations born between the beginning of the 19th century and the First World War declined, however, in generations born after 1915 it increased again with consecutive years of birth. In women the risk of death increased with the year of birth. The impact of five-year periods on mortality increased slowly, however, in women only from the first half of the seventies."Lung	Clinical	"It is well known that vocal cord paralysis is sometimes the only sign of an otherwise symptom-free malignant tumor. We report 69 cases of vocal cord paralysis caused by malignant tumor experienced at our clinic over the past 18 years. They consisted of 28 cases of thyroid cancer, 21 lung cancer, 14 esophageal cancer, 3 mediastinal tumors and 3 tumors of miscellaneous origin: 41 cases were male and 28 female. In the 65 patients with unilateral paralysis, the left side was affected in 45 and the right in 20. The remaining 4 patients had bilateral paralysis. There was a marked sex difference in the origin of malignant tumors; the incidence of lung cancer was higher in males with paralysis on the left side, while that of thyroid cancer was higher in females. Ultrasonography (US) of the neck, chest X-ray, CT scan of the chest and contrast esophagography should be performed for the detection of malignant tumors in cases with left paralysis, while US of the neck and chest X-ray appear to be sufficient in cases of right paralysis."Lung	Clinical	"It is well known that vocal cord paralysis is sometimes the only sign of an otherwise symptom-free malignant tumor.

Major differences were observed for all common cancer sites, including stomach (49/100,000 males in Costa Rica, 38 in the USSR and Japan vs 5/100,000 in the United States), intestines (over 25/100,000 males in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and New Zealand vs 10-15/100,000 in Japan and Southern Europe and less than 5/100,000 in most Latin American and Asian countries), lung (over 70/100,000 in Belgium, Scotland, The Netherlands, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and less than 20/100,000 in most Latin American and Asian countries; over 20/100,000 females in Britain, Hong Kong, the United States and Denmark vs less than 5/100,000 in France, Spain and again most areas of Asia and Africa providing data; breast (over 25/100,000 females in Great Britain, New Zealand, Belgium, The Netherlands and Uruguay, vs less than 10/100,000 in Japan, Hong Kong and most Latin American countries). Thus, there was over a fivefold variation in total cancer mortality for both sexes, the highest rates being in Hungary (237/100,000) and Czechoslovakia (229/100,000) for males, and in Denmark (142/100,000) and Scotland (138/100,000) for females. Although problems of validity and reliability of cancer death certification, mostly in developing countries, may in part explain this variation, these substantial differences are at least in part real and essentially reflect, besides the impact of breast cancer in females and of stomach and colorectal cancer in both sexes, the different spectrum of the tobacco-related lung cancer epidemic in the two sexes and in various areas of the world."Lung	Epidemiology	"Lung cancer cases were abstracted from cancer registries in 20 countries to study the distribution of small cell lung cancer around 1985. The international patterns of small cell lung cancer resemble those of squamous cell tumours, and of lung cancer as a whole. Cigarette smoking and occupational risk factors are more strongly associated with squamous and small cell lung cancers than with adenocarcinoma. Inspection of sex differences and time trends in incidence show some differences which may relate to a higher risk for small cell lung cancer in female smokers than in males, and a less rapid decline in risk on smoking cessation."Lung	Review	"The results of studies concerning the mortality rates of both sexes are of great similarity in all industrial countries. For underdeveloped countries, little information is available, but analogue proportions can be supposed. In the nations of the industrialized world males have a significantly higher mortality rate, which shortens their life expectancy in comparison with that of woman. Since about 1970 a deceleration of this development has been observed. The diseases responsible for this fact are ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, accidents, and other traumatic incidences, but also infectious diseases. Concerning the origins of ischemic heart disease, the influence of sex hormones especially on the lipid profile are being discussed; nevertheless, for the enhanced coronary risk of males environmental and behavioral factors seem to be more important than biological reasons. As for carcinosis being a reason for the mortality of males, lung cancer is in the foremost position. Cigarette consumption, as well as the higher exposure to cancerogenic substances related to typically male professions, are held responsible for this. As for other types of cancer, environmental factors depending on gender are strongly considered as a reason for different rates of mortality. Furthermore, sociological explanations for these differing frequencies are being discussed. Occupational differences and the different positions held in working life by each gender are believed to be responsible for the higher rate of mortality among males. Also, risktaking behavior seems to be found more often among males, than among females. A variety of hypotheses based on genetics have been given to explain the different gender-specific rates of mortality, but none of them has yet been proven correct.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"Lung	Epidemiology	"Lung cancer cases were abstracted from cancer registries in 20 countries to study the distribution of small cell lung cancer around 1985.

Cases included 736 White males, 860 White females, 269 Black males, and 86 Black females with incident, histologically confirmed, primary cancer of the trachea, bronchus, or lung. Controls were identified through drivers' license and Health Care Financing Administration files and included 548 White males, 473 White females, 170 Black males, and 47 Black females. Usual intakes of vegetables (predominantly yellow/green) and fruit (predominantly yellow/orange) as well as other food sources of carotenoids were ascertained by a food frequency questionnaire. White females showed significant inverse associations of lung cancer with vegetables, fruit, and carotenoids. White males showed nonsignificant inverse associations with vegetables and carotenoids, and Black females just with vegetables. No inverse associations were found for Black males. Vegetable consumption was associated with risk of all histologic types of lung cancer, but the pattern of increasing risk with decreasing intake was limited to smokers. We infer that consumption of yellow/green vegetables and carotenoids may confer protection from lung cancer to White male and White female smokers. Further studies are needed to clarify the effect in Blacks."Lung	Clinical	"We used data from a case-control study conducted in New Jersey between 1980 and 1983 to evaluate race and sex differences in associations of vegetable, fruit, and carotenoid consumption with lung cancer.

(A sex mortality ratio is the ratio of male to female death rates.) Previous analyses have shown that during the mid-twentieth century sex mortality ratios increased for all adult age groups. During the 1980s sex mortality ratios continued to increase for 25-34 year olds, but showed mixed trends for other adult age groups. For example, for older adults aged 55-64, sex mortality ratios increased in Southern and Eastern European countries and Japan, but sex mortality ratios decreased in Northern European and Anglophone countries. Trends in several causes of death contributed to these trends in sex mortality ratios. For example, for 25-34 year olds, increases in men's suicide rates and HIV or AIDS mortality contributed to the increases in sex mortality ratios. For older adults, it was hypothesized that decreasing sex differences in cigarette smoking in recent decades would result in decreasing sex differences in lung cancer and ischemic heart disease mortality during the 1980s. The predicted decrease in sex differences in lung cancer mortality was observed in many countries; women had more unfavorable lung cancer mortality trends than men in the Anglophone countries and Northern and Central Western European countries. In contrast, very little evidence was found for the predicted decrease in sex differences in ischemic heart disease. The paper presents additional data concerning the contributions of trends in specific causes of death to changes in sex mortality ratios and briefly reviews evidence concerning probable causes of the observed mortality trends. It appears that recent trends in sex mortality ratios have been influenced by changing sex differences in smoking and a variety of additional factors, such as the effects of improvements in health care interacting with inherent sex differences in vulnerability to ischemic heart disease."Lung	Review	"This paper analyzes changes in sex mortality ratios between 1979 and 1987 for adults in 23 developed countries.

In the current study, case-control data were examined for sex-race differences in the lung cancer risk associated with cigarette smoking. Results indicate that Kreyberg I lung cancers (squamous cell and oat cell carcinomas) are associated with heavier intensity of smoking than Kreyberg II lung cancer (adenocarcinomas and alveolar cell carcinomas); blacks are at higher risk than whites (relative risk = 1.8), and women are at higher risk than men for a given level of smoking (RR = 1.7). Our findings indicate the existence of important differences in the smoking-associated risk for lung cancer which depend upon sex, race, and histology."Lung	Epidemiology	"Despite the extreme differences in the incidence of lung cancer between black and white Americans of each sex, little information is available on the sex-race-specific lung cancer risk due to tobacco use.

Smoking habits were abstracted from medical records for 1153 men and 833 women diagnosed with primary lung cancer in 1984-1986 and 1851 men and 1656 women aged 30 or older diagnosed with cancers not associated with smoking. Ninety-six percent of men and 89% of women with lung cancer were current or former cigarette smokers, as compared with 55% of men and 34% of women with other cancers. The age and ethnicity-adjusted odds ratios (OR) for ever-smoking were 19.7 for men and 15.0 for women. Men and women who smoked 2 or more packs per day experienced nearly equal risks. Comparison of the most common cell types showed that women smokers had equal or lower ORs for squamous-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, but higher OR for small-cell carcinoma, as compared with men smokers. While the smoking-associated OR were equal for small-cell and squamous-cell carcinomas in men, the OR for women were significantly higher for small-cell carcinoma than for squamous-cell carcinoma."Lung	Epidemiology	"The importance of cigarette smoking as a risk factor for specific histologic types of lung cancer in men and women has been examined in a case-control analysis of data from the Cancer Surveillance Program of Orange County, a population-based registry.

The quit rate increased over time in all sex-occupational groups except for male laborers, whose quit rate remained constant. Nicotine-dependent smokers are likely to find it difficult to quit. Male nicotine-dependent smokers were consistently found in greater numbers among blue collar workers throughout the study period. Initially, female nicotine-dependent smokers were more often found among blue collar workers, but in recent years became more frequent among white collar workers.These trends provide clues to the future epidemiological distribution of lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases. An understanding of gender differences in the occupational profile of cigarette smokers can provide guidelines for effective antismoking interventions."Lung	Review	"Lung cancer is a preventable disease. Like acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, lung cancer is reaching epidemic proportions in women. This article overviews selected epidemiology of lung cancer and discusses public health issues that are gender-specific to women. Community nursing approaches are advocated that address risk behaviors in women and girls."Lung	Epidemiology	"National data from 1943 to 1987 on the two most frequent tobacco-related cancers in Denmark, lung and bladder cancer, were analyzed with multiplicative Poisson models. The temporal trends in the cohort-specific risks for both sites and sexes were similar: the risks increased in the beginning of the period covered by the analysis, but then levelled off; and there was no increase among cohorts born after circa 1930. Women experienced a smaller increase during the period covered by the analysis in the cohort-specific risk for bladder cancer than men (3.7 cf 6.1 times), whereas the overall increase in lung-cancer cohort-specific risk was the same for both sexes. The difference could not be explained by trends in tobacco consumption, types of tobacco consumed, or occupational exposures. On the basis of these findings, it is suggested that women may be less susceptible than men to developing bladder cancer from tobacco smoking."Lung	Epidemiology	"In a previous study conducted by mail questionnaire and with a large proportion of surrogate responders, we found differences in smoking habits, age at diagnosis, tumour cell type distribution and occupational exposures between men and women who developed primary lung cancer. This study was designed to confirm those findings by conducting personal case interviews and extend them by examining the impact of certain biological factors. We have investigated demographic, smoking, occupational and medical history sex differences in cases with primary lung cancer by interviewing 273 male and 103 female cases diagnosed between November 1983 and July 1986. The females were significantly younger at diagnosis, a pattern consistent for all cell types. Squamous cell (40%), small cell anaplastic (20%) and adenocarcinomas (16%) were the most prevalent cell types in men. In women, similar frequencies of adenocarcinomas (32%) and squamous cell carcinomas (29%) occurred. Despite a higher prevalence of physician diagnosed allergy and asthma among women, minimal sex differences in the prevalence of atopy as measured by prick skin test were found. Female cases were more likely to be lifetime non-smokers (15% vs 3%), to have started smoking on average 3 years older and to smoke 6 fewer cigarettes per day. The mean pack years of female cases was significantly lower than males' for squamous, adenocarcinoma and small cell anaplastic tumours. The majority of these women had not been occupationally exposed to any substance known to be carcinogenic or to damage the lung.

Observed numbers of deaths from 1979 to 1985 for total cancers and most cancer sites in Suffolk County black men and women were not lower than expected on the basis of age-specific and gender-specific death rates for blacks in the US. Although numbers of deaths from cervical cancer and prostate cancer were slightly lower than expected in Suffolk County blacks versus American blacks, these numbers were still significantly greater than expected on the basis of death rates among American whites. Age-specific death rates for age groups 25 to 44 years to 55 to 64 years tended to be lower in Suffolk County for lung cancers in black men but not for breast cancer in black women. Specific cancer sites, which differ in the direction of the association between incidence and socioeconomic status, age, and gender must be considered in comparisons of cancer mortality by race and socioeconomic level. Implications of the comparisons were discussed with regard to the goal of reducing racial differences in cancer death rates."Lung	Epidemiology	"A retrospective study of 478 men and 294 women with primary lung cancer was conducted to characterize sex-associated differences in their presentation and survival. At the time of diagnosis, women were younger than men (mean age, 57.4 +/- 10.4 v 60.2 +/- 9.9 years, respective; P = .0007). Men were more likely to be current or previous smokers (94% v 84%; P less than .005), and in patients with a positive smoking history, cigarette consumption was greater in men (52.2 v 40.2 pack years; P = .0001). The proportion of adenocarcinomas compared with squamous cancers was high in women (45% v 23%), while these cell types were equally represented in men. The majority of patients in both sex groups had regionally advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Survival was related to age, stage at presentation and cell type. In addition, sex was found to be an independent prognostic factor for survival. Women with tumors of all cell types lived longer than their male counterparts (P less than .0001), and survival by stage in patients with nonsmall-cell cancers was greater for women than it was for men. These data demonstrate that important sex-associated differences exist in presentation and survival from lung cancer. Such differences should be considered when planning and analyzing clinical trials."Lung	Clinical	"A retrospective study of 478 men and 294 women with primary lung cancer was conducted to characterize sex-associated differences in their presentation and survival.

Food frequency questionnaires have been used to assess dietary intake of food groups and to generate indices of specific dietary components, in particular retinol and carotene. Serum levels of retinol, carotenoids, and other micronutrients have been determined as well, and related to risk of lung cancer. The dietary studies have been notably consistent, finding an approximate 50% reduction in risk associated with high compared to low consumption of carotene-containing fruits and vegetables. Unresolved issues include gender differences, histological specificity and the interaction with cigarette smoking as well as the role of other possible protective factors found in these foods--indoles, vitamin C, trace minerals. Most studies in which serum beta-carotene was assayed in prospectively collected blood samples have found lower levels of beta-carotene in people who subsequently developed lung cancer. Unlike carotene, blood retinol levels do not reflect dietary intake under normal conditions and, as might be expected, have failed to show a consistent relation with risk of lung cancer. Although epidemiological studies have not strongly supported the role of preformed retinol as a protective agent, animal studies have provided convincing evidence that retinol and synthetic retinoids are protective against epithelial tumours including those of the lung. A number of on-going clinical trials are testing the efficacy of retinol, beta-carotene, synthetic retinoids and alpha-tocopherol for preventing cancer of the lung, especially in high risk groups such as heavy smokers, miners and asbestos workers. It is hoped that these trials will help explain the nature of the observed protective effect of fruit and vegetables."Lung	Outcomes	"From 1974 to 1988, 492 patients (361 male and 131 female) with non-small cell lung cancer underwent pulmonary resection at our department. A retrospective study was done with special reference to the sex of the patients. There was no sex-related association with age distribution, operation, pathological T or N status, or staging. On the other hand, 77.9% of women had an adenocarcinoma and only 44.6% of men had this type of lesion. This was considered at least partly a result of sex difference in smoking habits. Women survived for a significantly longer time (p = 0.0036), and this difference could not be explained by differences in histological type. Presumably, hormonal factor(s) may contribute to the prognosis."Lung	Outcomes	"From 1974 to 1988, 492 patients (361 male and 131 female) with non-small cell lung cancer underwent pulmonary resection at our department.

The rates expected of smokers among these cases were calculated from the sex and age specific rates of smokers in the general population, reported annually by the Japan Tobacco and Salt Public Corporation. The odds ratios for smoking were estimated to be 5.2, 3.1, 6.9, and 4.1 in men for squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma, and 7.2, 1.8, 14.4 and 3.8 in women respectively. Significant differences in the odds ratios for each histologic type between men and women were observed only for adenocarcinoma. In squamous cell carcinomas, the odds ratios were estimated by dividing them into two groups according to location. No difference was found between men and women in this respect."Lung	Epidemiology	"In order to clarify sex differences associated with the relationship between smoking and each histologic type of lung cancer, the smoking histories of 2,083 lung cancer patients (1,660 men and 423 women) diagnosed at the Center for Adult Diseases, Osaka, from 1965 to 1983 were analyzed.

As in other industrialized countries, men in the FRG, compared to women, have higher mortality rates in all leading causes of death. The sex differences are most prominent in coronary heart disease, lung cancer, fatal accidents, suicide and liver cirrhosis. For example, in the age groups 35 to 55 the male/female ratio in the mortality rates was 6 to 7 for coronary heart disease, 3 to 4 for lung cancer, and 4 for fatal accidents. The cause-specific death rates and the results from corresponding epidemiological studies indicate that genetic disadvantages of men are reinforced by factors of the social environment and 'deleterious' individual behavior. Thus a great part of the sex differences in total mortality could be influenced and should not be judged as inevitable."Lung	Epidemiology	"Differences between men and women regarding morbidity have been investigated in relation to tobacco smoking, among 2,009 70-year-olds in the longitudinal gerontological study in Gothenburg, Sweden. Male smokers (44%) had started smoking earlier (age 18) than female (14%, age 30), consumed more tobacco and more often inhaled tobacco smoke. Peptic ulcer, chronic bronchitis and lung cancer were examples of diseases more common in males. ECG evidences of myocardial ischemia were more common in males, while anginal pain showed the same prevalence. Cholecystectomy and antihypertensive treatment were more common among females. When adjustments were made for duration of smoking, amount of tobacco consumed, significant sex differences were still observed for ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia (dominance in males), peptic ulcer (dominance in males), intermittent claudication (dominance in females) and treatment for hypertension (dominance in females). The majority of disorders predominant in males were found to be related to smoking, while those predominating among females showed the same sex difference when adjustments were made for smoking habits. Future increasing segments of females addicted to tobacco smoking will obviously markedly influence sex difference in morbidity."Lung	Review	"The contribution of smoking to sex differences in mortality is estimated on the basis of data from 12 studies of the mortality of nonsmoking men and women, together with mortality data for comparable general population samples. Most of the data are for samples drawn from the U.S. population from the late 1950s to 1980. The findings from different studies are generally consistent, once methodological factors are taken into account. The findings indicate that, for total mortality, the proportion of sex differences attributable to smoking decreases from about two-thirds at age 40 to about one-quarter at age 80. Over the adult age span, it appears that about half of the sex difference in total mortality is attributable to smoking. Findings for ischemic heart disease mortality show a similar pattern. For lung cancer, it appears that about 90 percent of the sex difference in mortality is attributable to smoking. The estimated contributions of smoking include both the effects of sex differences in smoking habits and the effects of sex differences in the increase in mortality caused by smoking. The quantitative results should be interpreted with caution, since several lines of argument suggest that multivariate analyses controlling for other relevant factors would produce lower estimates of the contribution of smoking to sex differences in mortality. Despite this limitation, the findings analyzed in this review, together with additional evidence from related research, strongly support the conclusion that cigarette smoking makes a major contribution to men's higher mortality, but other factors also play an important role."Lung	Review	"The contribution of smoking to sex differences in mortality is estimated on the basis of data from 12 studies of the mortality of nonsmoking men and women, together with mortality data for comparable general population samples.

Recent surveys of smoking behavior in California, Texas, and New Mexico indicate a notable sex difference in smoking among Latinos, with Latino males smoking at least as frequently as White males, while Latino females report smoking rates considerably lower than White females. Our analysis of the 1979 and 1980 National Health Interview Surveys corroborates this finding and also indicates that this pattern holds true for subgroups of the Latino population, including country of origin. Taken together, these findings suggest that among Latino males rates of lung cancer and other cigarette-linked diseases may increase in the near future."Lung	Review	"In this paper we review evidence on smoking and lung cancer among Latinos, including findings from several unpublished studies and technical reports.

The enzyme activities have been compared with various laboratory parameters. Controls were healthy subjects. No significant sex differences of carboxypeptidases N and angiotensin-I-converting enzyme were found in the healthy controls or in the whole patients' group. The carboxypeptidases N were significantly elevated in patients with lung cancer (p less than 0.0001) compared to the healthy controls. The angiotensin-I-converting enzyme was significantly reduced (p less than 0.0001) in serum of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma. In responders to chemo- and/or radiotherapy, the carboxypeptidases decreased and the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme increased to normal enzyme values. In non-responders to these therapies no change in these enzymes could be observed."Lung	Epidemiology	We investigated the present incidence of lung cancer and its distribution by histologic type in Nagasaki City using Nagasaki Tumor Registry data from the years 1973-1977. The risk of radiogenic lung cancer did not increase significantly in either sex. The difference in relative distribution by histologic type between the exposure and non-exposure groups was not significant. Further analyses should be carried out on the risk present for individuals who were young at the time the bomb was dropped and the effect of exposure distance on the incidence and histologic types of lung cancer in A-bomb survivors.Lung	Review	"In the United States women live longer than men, and they have lower death rates at virtually every age and for most causes of death. Similar relationships prevail in most developed nations. The sex differential in mortality has been increasing since the early 1900s , especially for those 15-24 and 55-64 years of age. Since 1970, however, that trend has slowed for persons 45-74, and in 1980 the sex differential was actually lower than in 1970 among those 55-64. Although the female sex advantage in respect to most causes of death has been increasing, the differential for coronary heart disease has recently stabilized; and the lung cancer mortality rate among women is now increasing faster than that among men. Recent statistics for these two important causes of death may indicate that the previous, more favorable trend in women than in men may be reversing in response to changes in lifestyle. Women's health may be improving at a slower rate because they are exposed to more job stresses and other risk factors, such as cigarettes, than before; alternatively, men's health may be improving at a faster rate because they are exercising more, smoking cigarettes less, and following healthier diets in recent decades. Despite their continuing mortality advantage, women experience more illness than men. This may reflect women's greater utilization of medical services, and physicians' diagnostic patterns, as well as women's greater willingness to acknowledge and report illness. Sex differences in illness persist, however, when physical examinations are used for assessment in population-based samples. Women appear to have higher rates of conditions that rarely cause death, for example, rheumatoid arthritis; whereas men tend to have more fatal conditions, such as coronary heart disease. At least two categories of lifestyle characteristics are associated with male-female differences in health: (a) social roles, such as marriage, parenthood, and employment; and (b) behaviors, such as cigarette smoking and Type A behavior. Preliminary evidence indicates that some of these lifestyle characteristics may act synergistically on health. Several aspects of lifestyle thus underlie sex differences in morbidity and mortality. There is also evidence that biological factors influence male/female mortality differences, particularly in infancy and prenatal life. A substantial sex differential remains, however, even after adjusting for numerous lifestyle and biological variables. This is especially true for heart disease mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"Lung	Review	"In the United States women live longer than men, and they have lower death rates at virtually every age and for most causes of death.

Male overmortality is highest in Finland and the USSR, followed closely by France, Poland, the USA and Canada. The differential is lowest in Japan, Ireland and in south-eastern Europe. The sex mortality ratio is highest at ages 15-24 years with a second peak generally occurring around age 60. The excess mortality of males at the younger ages is due largely to motor vehicle accidents while higher death rates from heart disease and lung cancer in particular account for a substantial proportion of male excess mortality during the later years of working life. During the course of the 20th century, the impact of sex differences in mortality from the infectious and parasitic diseases has declined, as has the contribution from maternal mortality. Males have also benefited from a decline in industrial accidents but this has been more than countered by rising death rates from heart diseases, lung cancer and motor vehicle accidents."Lung	Epidemiology	"Family histories pertaining to cancer of all anatomic sites were ascertained on 88 Caucasian patients (61 males, 27 females) with histologically verified lung cancer. Lifetable analysis revealed that relatives of female probands had a significantly higher risk for cancer (all sites) at younger age (p less than .04) compared to relatives of male probands. This trend was peculiar to nonsmoking-associated cancer sites, and was not apparent for smoking-associated cancer sites. We hypothesize that certain components of genetic liability to lung cancer are common to nonsmoking-associated malignant neoplasms, and that females who develop lung cancer are more extreme with respect to genotype than are males who develop lung cancer. Our hypothesis accounts for the lower incidence of lung cancer among females, as well as the apparent increased susceptibility to cancer among their relatives."Lung	Pathophysiology	"Family histories pertaining to cancer of all anatomic sites were ascertained on 88 Caucasian patients (61 males, 27 females) with histologically verified lung cancer.
