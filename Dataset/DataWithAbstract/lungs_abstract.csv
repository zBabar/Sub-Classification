Interactions between environment and individual genetic profile are particularly important for this disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of CYP1A1*2A, CYP1A1*2C, CYP2D6*4, GSTP1, GSTM1, GSTT1 and NAT2 polymorphisms for the susceptibility to LC in a Portuguese population considering their demographic and clinical characteristics.A total of 200 LC and 247 controls subjects from the Centre of Portugal were studied. Clinical and demographic characteristics were collected from clinical files and by individual questionnaires. Polymorphisms of CYP1A1*2A, CYP1A1*2C, CYP2D6*4, GSTP1, GSTM1, GSTT1 and NAT2 were genotyped using PCR-RFLP, PCR multiplex, ARMS and real time.Gender, family history of cancer, smoke cessation and alcohol consumption were independent risk factors (p < 0.05). Associations found between phases I and II genes and LC population reveal a sex dependent distribution. Logistic regression analysis demonstrates that enhanced activation by CYPs, associated by reduced or loss of function of phase II enzymes, can lead to a greater risk. GSTP1 and NAT2 polymorphisms studied have a significant contribution for the histological tumour types and the presence of metastases, at time of diagnosis, respectively, when males with smoking habits were considered.Multiple interactions between environment and individual characteristics are clearly associated to this disease. Variants of the detoxification genes may act synergistically contributing to this disease and modifying the risk posed by smoking and sex. The GSTT1*0 and GSTP1 (Ile462Val) might contribute to the malignant phenotype through different mechanisms."

However, carcinogenesis of TB and its connection with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation remains unclear. This study aimed to determine this connection to see if TB can affect the outcome of patients with lung cancer. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with lung cancer receiving EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) between 1996 and 2010 using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Because therapeutic response was required to apply EGFR-TKIs for >90 days, only patients with a follow-up of >120 days were studied and a responder was defined as intake of EGFR-TKIs >90 days. Predictors of EGFR-TKI response and survival were identified using logistic and Cox regression analyses, respectively. There were 8265 patients analyzed, including 6073 (73.5%) EGFR-TKI responder and 2192 (26.5%) nonresponder. A history of TB was found in 1.2% and 1.8% of the 2 groups, respectively. Comparing to male with pulmonary TB history, female with or without pulmonary TB history and male without pulmonary TB history all had a better EGFR-TKI response and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS). Gender and TB history were not independent prognostic factors of 2-year overall survival. The findings were similar in the subpopulation without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancies other than lung cancer, and low-income status. TB has a gender-dependent impact, with better EGFR-TKI response and 1-year PFS in female patients with lung cancer. The carcinogenesis and inflammation of TB may be different between genders."

Besides, smoking is more prevalent in Taiwanese men. This study evaluated gender disparities in coexisting pulmonary diseases on survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer between 2003 and 2008 were identified from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Cases with lung adenocarcinoma were further confirmed using the Cancer Registry Database and followed up until the end of 2010. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of coexisting asthma, COPD, and/or TB to estimate all-cause mortality risk. During the study period, 13,399 cases of lung adenocarcinoma were identified. The HRs of adenocarcinoma in men and women were 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.30) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.95-1.16), respectively, for individuals with asthma, 1.32 (95% CI, 1.16-1.51) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.89-1.05), respectively, for COPD, and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.93-1.06) and 1.06 (95% CI, 0.86-1.32), respectively, for individuals with TB. Specifically, among men with coexisting pulmonary diseases, the HRs were 1.63 (95% CI, 1.25-2.13), 1.31 (95% CI, 1.08-1.59), and 1.23 (95% CI, 1.11-1.36) for individuals with asthma + COPD + TB, asthma + COPD, and COPD + TB, respectively. However, there was no increase risk of mortality among women with coexisting pulmonary diseases. Coexisting pulmonary diseases are at an elevated risk of mortality among male patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Such patients deserve greater attention while undergoing cancer treatment."

A chi-square test was used to compare variables. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.Of the 844 patients, 117 (13.9%) were women and 727 (86.1%) were men. Adenocarcinoma was more common in women than in men (p<0.0001). There were more women non-smokers than men (p<0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in ECOG PS, weight loss>10%, stage, LDH, albumin and treatment between women and men. Women younger than 65 years (17.0 vs 12.0 months; p=0.03), who had adenocarcinoma histology (15.0 vs 10.0 months; p=0.006) and who had a hemoglobin level≥12 g/dL (18.0 vs 12.0 months; p=0.01) were found to have a better median OS rate than men. Median OS rates were found to be 13.0 months in females and 12.0 months in males (p=0.14). Among metastatic patients, the median OS was 11.0 months in females and 8.0 months in males (p=0.005). Among stage IIIB and stage IV patients who had first line platinum-based chemotherapy, the median OS was 17.0 months in women and 11.0 months in men (p=0.002). The response rate of chemotherapy was higher in women than in men (p=0.03).In our study, we found that survival duration is longer and chemotherapy response is better in women with NSCLC who do not have anemia or comorbidities and who are mostly non-smokers with adenocarcinomas. Further studies regarding the causes of these differences may provide clarity on this subject."

This study investigates characteristics of TSAs when most severe, reported by patients after starting treatment for lung cancer.Data was collected regarding TSAs, symptoms, food intake and nutritional status through structured interviews using the Taste and Smell Survey, the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment and 3-day food diaries. This data derives from a longitudinal project and the interview with each patient when TSAs were most severe was purposefully selected for analysis.Sixty-one of the 89 patients reported TSAs, and the TSAs group were on average younger and more frequently smokers. Thirty-one patients reported symptoms impacting negatively on food intake, with 87 % in the TSAs group and 13 % in the no-TSAs group. Most commonly reported were loss of appetite, nausea and early satiety. Gender differences were seen with more women reporting stronger sensation(s) and more men reporting weaker sensation(s) and other changes. TSAs were described as affecting enjoyment of food and eating. A trend was seen where energy intakes declined with increasing TSAs. Energy intakes in the total study population were below recommended.TSAs varied in characteristics and interacted with other symptoms. Gender differences may highlight a need to investigate approaches for identification and management of TSAs in men and women. Patients reported TSAs impacting on food enjoyment, and the hypothesis that patients with higher TSS scores have lower nutritional intakes should be followed up with a larger study in the lung cancer population."

We found a partial mediation effect of resilience and marital satisfaction on the relationship between gender and mental distress. Taking these results into account, particularly female patients and partners should preferably receive psychooncological support. "

Both studies were promoted by the French College of General Hospital Respiratory Physicians (CPHG). KBP-2010-CPHG collected data for 6083 NSCLC diagnosed between January 1st and December 31st, 2010, and followed in the respiratory departments of 119 French general hospitals.In 2010, 24.4 % of the patients were women (16 % in 2000, p<0.0001). Compared to men, women were more commonly non-smokers (34.2 vs 4.7 %) or lighter consumers (37.2 vs 43.7 pack per years) (p<0.0001). Their tumours (mostly adenocarcinoma: 64.6 vs 48.7 %, p<0.0001) were more frequently diagnosed at stage IV (62.4 vs 56.9 %, p=0.0008). EGFR mutation research was more frequently performed (48.5 vs 31.0 %, p<0.0001) and positive (20.6 vs 5.2 %, p<0.0001) in women than men. Their treatment more frequently included targeted therapy (13.4 vs 5.7 %, p<0.0001). Compared to 2000, the percentage of non-smokers increased in men (4.7 vs 2.5 %, p<0.0001) while remaining stable in women (36.1 vs 34.2 %, p=0.32). The percentage of adenocarcinomas increased, particularly in men (48.7 vs 31.5 %, p<0.0001).The percentage of women with NSCLC has increased in 10years in France. In 2010, the main gender differences persist, but have decreased with the increasing proportion of non-smokers and adenocarcinomas in men. Various hypotheses to explain these changes are discussed."

In Europe, the smoking epidemic has evolved different rates and times, and policy responses to it, vary substantially between countries. Differences in smoking prevalence are much more evident among European women reflecting the heterogeneity in cancer incidence rates. Other factors rather than smoking and linked to sex may increase women's susceptibility to lung cancer, such as genetic predisposition, exposure to sex hormones and molecular features, all of them linked to epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of lung cancer in women. However, biological bases of sex-specific differences are controversial and need further evaluation. This review focuses on the epidemiology and outcome concerning non-small cell lung cancer in women, with emphasis given to the Spanish population. "

The cause of this disparity is unknown. For patients undergoing lung cancer resection, these survival differences could be due, in part, to relatively better perioperative outcomes for women. This study was undertaken to determine differences in perioperative outcomes after lung cancer surgery on the basis of sex.The Society of Thoracic Surgeons' General Thoracic Database was queried for all patients undergoing resection of lung cancer between 2002 and 2010. Postoperative complications were analyzed with respect to sex. Univariable analysis was performed, followed by multivariable modeling to determine significant risk factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality.A total of 34,188 patients (16,643 men and 17,545 women) were considered. Univariable analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences in postoperative complications favoring women in all categories of postoperative complications. Women also had lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.71; P < .001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that several preoperative conditions independently predicted 30-day mortality: male sex, increasing age, lower diffusion capacity, renal insufficiency, preoperative radiation therapy, cancer stage, extent of resection, and thoracotomy as surgical approach. Coronary artery disease was an independent predictor of mortality in women but not in men. Thoracotomy as the surgical approach and preoperative radiation therapy were predictive of mortality for men but not for women. Postoperative prolonged air leak and empyema predicted mortality in men but not in women.Women have lower postoperative morbidity and mortality after lung cancer surgery. Some risk factors are sex-specific with regard to mortality. Further study is warranted to determine the cause of these differences and to determine their effect on survival."

This proportion was highest among black men (24.7%), followed by white women (20.6%), black women (15.8%), and white men (15.0%). In adjusted analyses, white women showed greater risk for depression symptoms relative to black women (P = .01) and white men (P = .002), with no other differences among groups. Black patients were less likely than white patients to receive desired help for mood from their doctors (P = .02), regardless of sex. Among all patients, black women were most likely to have contact with pastoral care and social work.Race and sex interacted to predict risk of depression symptoms. Covariates accounted for elevated risk among black men. White women showed greater risk than black women and white men, independent of covariates.

An APC analysis was performed using a Poisson regression model.Lung cancer incidence rates were more than two times higher in males compared to females, and also higher in Chinese compared to Malays and Indians. While rates in Chinese men, and, to a lesser extent, Chinese women, had been declining since the early 1980s, rates in Malay men continued to increase. The full APC model described the cancer trend in Chinese males, Chinese females and Malay males, while an age-drift model described the cancer trend in Malay females. Among Chinese males, Chinese females and Malay males, there was no clear pattern to the period curvature effects, although similar cohort curvatures were seen, with positive curvature effects in older cohorts that declined towards zero and negative effects in younger cohorts.There are strong gender and ethnic differences in lung cancer incidence in Singapore. Differences in smoking rates and differential ethnic effects of smoking may explain some but not all of these differences. The similar cohort curvatures suggest that environmental factors in Singapore occurring in the past but no longer present at similar intensity or frequency may explain the positive deviation from a linear trend. Apart from smoking, other environmental factors such as changes in diet, improved sanitation and ventilation, and declines in infectious diseases like tuberculosis may play a role."

The earliest studies of lung cancer enrolled mainly men, as the incidence of lung cancer among women was exceedingly low. As social patterns changed around World War II and women began to smoke more, the epidemiology of lung cancer has changed. The higher percentage of lung cancer in nonsmoking women as compared with nonsmoking men suggests that lung cancer behaves differently in women. Studies of lung cancer in women indicate that there are differences in risk factors, histology, pathophysiology, treatment outcomes, and prognosis as compared with men. The purpose of this review is to provide a concise summary of the literature on lung cancer as it pertains to women, with an emphasis on new areas of research and treatment options. "

Sex differences in lung cancer incidence and survival are known. Female sex is an independent good prognostic factor. Estrogens appear to play a key role in lung cancer outcomes. Accordingly, antiestrogen use may also influence survival in female non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In this study, we compared survival among antiestrogen users and nonusers. We performed a retrospective population-based study. Using the Manitoba Cancer Registry (MCR), we identified all women diagnosed with NSCLC from 2000 to 2007. The population-based Drug Program Information Network was accessed to establish which patients received antiestrogens. Demographic data (e.g., smoking patterns, stage, histology) were gathered from the MCR and by chart review. Survival differences between antiestrogen-exposed and not exposed groups were compared using multivariable Cox regression. Two thousand three hundred twenty women fit our patient criteria, of which 156 had received antiestrogens. Exposure to antiestrogens was associated with a significantly decreased mortality in those exposed both before and after the diagnosis of NSCLC (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.42, p = 0.0006). This association remained consistent across age and stage groups. Antiestrogen use before and after the diagnosis of NSCLC is associated with decreased mortality. This supports previous evidence that estrogens may play a key role in the biology and outcomes of NSCLC and suggests a potential therapeutic use for these agents in this disease."

Data on screening with low-dose computed tomography are controversial; existing guidelines are not sex specific and recommend testing only for patients at high risk for the disease. Although cigarette smoking remains the predisposing factor that is most often associated with tumor development, the advent of molecularly targeted therapy and the growing evidence that susceptible targets are more prevalent in never-smoking women have brought more attention to this particular subpopulation. Studies of both surgery and systemic therapy suggest that not only never-smoking women but also women overall experience better outcomes than men. Identifying all of the factors contributing to these sex differences presents us with an opportunity to identify potentially a distinct tumor biology in women who would warrant a distinct personalized treatment approach.

Lung cancer, at the beginning of the last century a rare disease in women, has a growing incidence in women, in particular in young females. Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women in developed countries with different histological types and adenocarcinomas are more frequent in women than in men. Cigarette smoking is the most prevalent cause of lung cancer in women, in addition susceptibility to carcinogens may differ between the sexes. As more non-smoking women than men develop lung cancer, it is likely that they are exposed to excessive environmental carcinogens such as second-hand-smoking, in-house-radon or cooking fumes. Furthermore, genetic and hormonal influences play a role in lung cancer etiology for women. Taken together, women have a better overall survival than men with lung cancer. Differences in molecular susceptibility patterns are observed between men and women, and show that molecular targets such as EGFR or ALK more frequent in women."

Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal, negative binomial models were fitted on subgroup-specific death rates indirectly standardized by national references to explore age- and gender-specific spatio-temporal patterns of mortality due to lung cancer and other tobacco-related cancers in Switzerland for the time period 1969-2002. Differences influenced by linguistic region and life in rural or urban areas were also accounted for. Male lung cancer mortality was found to be rather homogeneous in space, whereas women were confirmed to be more affected in urban regions. Compared to the German-speaking part, female mortality was higher in the French-speaking part of the country, a result contradicting other reports of similar comparisons between France and Germany. The spatio-temporal patterns of mortality were similar for lung cancer and other tobacco-related cancers. The estimated mortality maps can support the planning in health care services and evaluation of a national tobacco control programme.

Their vital status was identified, and the date and underlying cause of death were verified from death registry. Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios by gender were computed with nationwide gender- and cause-specific mortality rates as reference. Male workers were 11 years older, and had 6 years longer exposure duration than females; 79% in males and 1% in females smoked. In males, the mortality rate of all cancers doubled; both larynx and lung cancer were four-fold, and mesothelioma was 33-fold. In females, there was slightly excess mortality from lung cancer and all cancers, and significant increase in mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. Other significantly increased mortality was seen from cancers of thymus, small intestine and penis in males, and cancers of bone and bladder in females. In addition to asbestosis, mortality from pulmonary heart disease was significantly elevated in both genders. The data confirmed significantly excess mortality from mesothelioma in either gender, lung and larynx cancers in males, and ovarian cancer in females. A gender difference in mortality from lung cancer and all cancers could be mainly due to the discrepancies in age, exposure duration and smoking between the male and female workers."

The most important risk factors for the development of lung cancer in both men and women is cigarette smoking. Smoking among women has increased significantly since the 1960s, and, unfortunately, the risk of death from cigarette smoking continues to increase among women. Although epidemiological data remain controversial regarding the increased risk of lung cancer from tobacco exposure in women, there is little controversy surrounding the fact that the biology of lung cancer differs between the sexes. This paper summarizes the explanations for the sex differences in lung cancer, including differences in molecular abnormalities, growth factor receptors, hormonal influences, cytochrome P-450 enzymes, and DNA repair capacity, as well as differences in the histology of lung cancer and treatment outcomes in women.

Significance of IHC was further confirmed in NSCLC cell lines via in vitro assays.IHC analysis of NSCLC patients demonstrated that both ERβ and aromatase were highly co-expressed (p=0.032) in carcinoma cells. Overall survival in males was significantly worse than that in postmenopausal female among double positive NSCLC patients (p=0.010) but not in non-double positive patients. In addition, among double positive cases, overall survival of males was significantly worse than that of postmenopausal females in those with higher ERβ Allred score ≥5, (p=0.034), but not in those with lower ERβ Allred score=3-4. In-vitro analysis demonstrated aromatase activity on testosterone treatment, which resulted in in situ estrogen production (p<0.0001) and increased proliferation of ERβ overexpressing A549 cells (p<0.0001). Aromatase inhibitor i.e. letrozole abrogated this proliferation and also enhanced the androgenic activity (p<0.0001). Testosterone treatment resulted in estrogen responsive elements activation (p<0.0001) in ERβ vector transfected A549 and LK87 cells whereas ER blocker i.e. fulvestrant abrogated this effect, (p<0.0001).Our results suggest that co-expression of ERβ and aromatase in NSCLCs of Japanese males may result in tumor progression and potential endocrine therapy may confer therapeutic benefits to these patients."

Collected data on demographic and disease characteristics of 654 LC patients presenting to the authors' institute was also analyzed. Smoking index (SI) was used for QSS and was defined as number of bidis and cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by years smoked. Patients were categorized as never-smokers [Group I, n=151]; light/moderate smokers (SI=1-300) [Group II, n=202] and heavy smokers (SI ≥301) [Group III, n=301].

The gender differential has steadily increased over time, reaching a peak of more than 8 years in 1980s, and decreased thereafter to 6.7 years in 2005. Studies to investigate the pattern and contributing factors to changes in the life expectancy gender gap have been mostly from Western countries, and there has been no such study in Asian countries, except in Japan. We therefore aimed to examine age- and cause-specific contributions to the changing gender differentials in life expectancy in Korea, in particular the decline of the gap, using a decomposition method. Between 1970 and 1979 when the gender gap in life expectancy widened, faster mortality decline among women in ages 20-44 explained 66% of the total increase in the gender gap, which would be due to substantial improvements in reproductive health among women and excess male mortality in occupational injuries and transport accidents. Although greater survival advantage among elderly women over 70 contributed to further increase in the gender gap, the contributions from younger ages with the ages 15-64 contributing the most (-2 years) resulted in the overall reduction of the gender gap which began in 1992 and continued to 2005. Among causes of death, liver diseases (-0.5 years, 38% of the total decline), transport accidents (-0.4 years, 31%), hypertensive diseases (-0.3 years, 19%), stroke (-0.1 years, 11%), and tuberculosis (-0.1 years) contributed the most to the overall 1.4 years reduction in the gender gap. However, changes in mortality from lung cancer (+0.3 years), suicide (+0.3 years), chronic lower respiratory diseases (+0.2 years), and ischemic heart diseases (+0.1 years) contributed to widening the gap during the same period. In sum, while smoking-related causes of death have contributed most to the narrowing gap in most other industrialized countries, these causes contributed toward increasing the gender gap in Korea. Instead, liver disease, hypertension-related diseases, and transport accidents were major contributing causes of death to the narrowing of gender differentials in life expectancy in Korea."

Anti-ABCC3 IgA and IgG were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approach that was developed in house with the human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II) restricted antigens.Mann-Whitney U test showed that the IgG antibody level was significantly higher in female patients with adenocarcinoma than female controls (Z = -4.34, P < 0.001) and that the IgA antibody level was significantly higher in male patients with squamous carcinoma than male controls (Z = -3.12, P = 0.002). Pearson's Chi-square (χ(2)) test showed that female patients with adenocarcinoma had a significantly higher positive rate for IgG autoantibody than female controls (χ ( 2 ) = 8.73, P = 0.003). The ELISA sensitivity against a specificity of >95 % was 18.1 % for IgG assay in female patients and 18.0 % for IgA assay in male patients. The inter-assay deviation was 10.6 % for IgG assay and 14.5 % for IgA assay.Circulating autoantibodies to ABCC3 transporter may be a potential biomarker that can be added to a panel of existing biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer although the gender differences should be taken into account."

The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer has identified both sex and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of (18)F-FDG in the primary tumor as measured by PET as potential prognostic variables. We examined the prognostic value of SUVmax in a surgical cohort of patients with NSCLC and disaggregated the findings by sex.Patients who had undergone a preoperative PET/CT scan and surgical resection with curative intent from 2001 to 2009 were identified from a prospective database. An SUVmax cutoff was calculated using receiver-operating-characteristic curves. Overall survival was correlated with SUVmax for the whole cohort and disaggregated by sex.Inclusion criteria were met by 189 patients: 127 (67%) men and 62 (33%) women. Five-year survival was 54.6% for the whole cohort, 47.7% for men, and 68.2% for women. SUVmax correlated negatively with survival in a univariate analysis for the whole cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54-4.09; P < 0.001) and men (HR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.94-6.05; P < 0.001) but not for women (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.43-3.12; P = 0.77), using 8 as a cutoff.

We developed a longitudinal biologically-based model of the relationship between individual smoking histories and the probability for lung cancer incidence, CT screen detection, lung cancer mortality, and other-cause mortality. The longitudinal model relates these different outcomes to an underlying lung cancer disease pathway and an effective other-cause mortality pathway, which are both influenced by the individual smoking history. The longitudinal analysis provides additional information over that available if these outcomes were analyzed separately, including testing if the number of CT detected and histologically-confirmed lung cancers is consistent with the expected number of lung cancers ""in the pipeline"". We assume indolent nodules undergo Gompertz growth and are detectable by CT, but do not grow large enough to contribute significantly to symptom-based lung cancer incidence or mortality. Likelihood-based model calibration was done jointly to data from 6878 heavy smokers without asbestos exposure in the control (placebo) arm of the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET); and to 3,642 heavy smokers with comparable smoking histories in the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study (PLuSS), a single-arm prospective trial of low-dose spiral CT screening for diagnosis of lung cancer. Model calibration was checked using data from two other single-arm prospective CT screening trials, the New York University Lung Cancer Biomarker Center (NYU) (n=1,021), and Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt) cohorts (n=677). In the PLuSS cohort, we estimate that at the end of year 2, after the baseline and first annual CT exam, that 33.0 (26.9, 36.9)% of diagnosed lung cancers among females and 7.0 (4.9,11.7)% among males were overdiagnosed due to being indolent cancers. At the end of the PLuSS study, with maximum follow-up of 5.8 years, we estimate that due to early detection by CT and limited follow-up, an additional 2.2 (2.0,2.4)% of all diagnosed cancers among females and 7.1 (6.7,8.0)% among males would not have been diagnosed in the absence of CT screening. We also find a higher apparent cure rate for lung cancer among CARET females than males, consistent with the larger indolent fraction of CT detected and histologically confirmed lung cancers among PLuSS females. This suggests that there are significant gender differences in the aggressiveness of lung cancer. Females may have an inherently higher proportion of indolent lung cancers than males, or aggressive lung cancers may be brought into check by the immune system more frequently among females than males."

We aimed to describe the hormonal and genetic profile of lung cancer in both men and women to identify gender specificities. Primary lung-tumor tissues from surgically treated patients, (50 men, 50 women) were analyzed and compared for expression of estrogen receptors (ER) α and β, progesterone receptors (PR), epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR), and HER2 (for EGFR and K-Ras mutations). These data were combined with clinical and outcome data. Fewer women with lung cancer were smokers (p=0.001) and they smoked fewer cigarettes (p=0.001). We observed a higher rate of EGFR mutations (p=0.02) and ERα expression (p=0.006) in women. ERβ and EGFR were also expressed more frequently in women (p=0.29 and p=0.16). HER2 was overexpressed regardless of gender in three men and two women. K-Ras was mutated in 16% of both men and women. Interestingly, there was a positive link between EGFR expression and expression of ERα (p=0.028) and ERβ (p=0.047) in both men and women. Expression of ERα was associated with improved disease-free survival (p=0.007). Our findings provide further evidence on the specificities of lung cancer in women. The differential expression of specific biomarkers, which could be targeted by therapy, favors the development of gender-based treatment guided by biomarker expression."

Women with NSCLC have a better prognosis compared to men, regardless of other factors. A possible role for oestrogen receptor (ER) signalling has been proposed. The role for ERβ in NSCLC is still not clear, especially concerning the impact of smoking. In a material of NSCLC (n = 262), ERβ and cyclins A1 and A2 were studied by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In 137 of those cases, frozen material was available, on which expression analysis of ESR2 (ERβ) and cyclin A1 were performed. Data were correlated to histology, gender, smoking habits, stage and clinical outcome. ERβ was expressed in 86% of the cases. ERβ was most frequently expressed in Stage I ADCAs, especially in male subjects. A correlation between ERβ expression and cyclins was observed in ADCA, also with a male predominance. ERβ transcripts had a positive prognostic impact in ADCA. ERβ transcripts were increased in NSCLC among smokers compared to non-smokers. In conclusion, our data support a role for ERβ in lung ADCAs, proposing a role for ERβ in lungcarcinogenesis, especially among smokers."

However, ALK-rearranged lung cancer tended to show more frequent lymph node metastasis despite its lower T stage. Similar to EGFR-mutated lung cancer, ALK-rearranged lung cancer was enriched in adenocarcinoma, women, and never-smokers. The results of ALK IHC and FISH obtained from tissue microarray (TMA)/biopsy specimens and whole sections after resection were concordant.ALK rearrangement was not a significant prognostic factor in surgically resectable NSCLC. The clinical profiles of ALK-rearranged lung cancer patients overlapped with those of EGFR-mutated patients.

The nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database was used to calculate standardized incidence ratios for common cancers among immigrants compared to Swedes. Immigrants were classified into ""high-risk"" countries when their risk was increased, into ""low-risk"" when their risk was decreased and into ""other"" when their risk was nonsignificant. Among those who immigrated at younger age (<30 years), we found an increasing trend for colorectal cancer risk in low-risk men and high-risk women. Among those who immigrated at older age (≥ 30 years), a decreasing lung cancer risk in high-risk men and an increasing breast cancer risk in low-risk women were observed. The increasing trend of prostate cancer risk was independent of age at immigration. The risk trends for ""other"" immigrants were between the risks of low- and high-risk countries. The gender-specific shifts in cancer risks in immigrants toward the risk in natives indicate a major role of sex, age at immigration and environmental exposures in colorectal and lung cancers risks. In contrast, the unchanged trend of breast cancer among those who immigrated at younger ages and an increasing trend for those who migrated at older ages may suggest a limited effect for environmental exposures, especially at younger age.

Whether such differences are inherent and/or whether sex steroids play a role in modulating these differences is currently under investigation. The purpose of this review is to define sex differences in lung structure/function under normal and specific disease states, with exploration of whether and how sex hormone signaling mechanisms may explain these clinical observations. Focusing on adult age groups, the review addresses the following: 1) inherent sex differences in lung anatomy and physiology; 2) the importance of certain time points in life such as puberty, pregnancy, menopause, and aging; 3) expression and signaling of sex steroid receptors under normal vs. disease states; 4) potential interplay between different sex steroids; 5) the question of whether sex steroids are beneficial or detrimental to the lung; and 6) the potential use of sex steroid signaling as biomarkers and therapeutic avenues in lung diseases.

Follow-up of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) primarily relies on the detection of either relapse or progression and does not include screening for second malignancies. This study investigated the incidence of independent non-urothelial second malignancies and associated risk factors in patients with NMIBC.The charts of 380 consecutive patients (297 men and 83 women) with newly diagnosed NMIBC over a 16-year period at a Swiss hospital were analysed retrospectively. Age, stage of bladder tumour, smoking status, and occurrence of second and third malignancies were registered. Observed incidences of independent non-urothelial malignancies were compared with age- and gender-specific rates based on data from the National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs).Mean age at first NMIBC diagnosis was 69.9 years.

One group included 85 female patients with stage I lung cancer, and the second group had 48 female and 66 male patients with stage I-IV lung cancer. Survival times were compared by the log-rank test between groups separated by tumor parathyroid hormone-related protein status.Parathyroid hormone-related protein was present in 70%-80% of the patients, independent of sex, stage, and smoking history. In the females with stage I lung cancer, parathyroid hormone-related protein increased median survival from 25 to 60 months (P < .05).

Parathyroid hormone-related protein remained a significant, independent predictor when evaluated together with other covariates by Cox multivariate regression.This study verifies that parathyroid hormone-related protein is a sex-dependent survival factor for non-small-cell lung carcinoma, that it correlates with disease-free survival, and that the association with survival holds for women with early-stage disease as well as more advanced cancer.

Although the mechanism(s) explaining this gender-dependent difference in lung cancer risk is not known, it is thought that endocrine factors may play an important role. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells contain estrogen receptors and synthesize 17β-estradiol (E(2)) and estrone (E(1)), which can undergo further metabolism into the catechol estrogens, 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE(2)) and 4-hydroxyestrone (4-OHE(1)), respectively. Catechol estrogens are formed from E(2) by the actions of cytochrome p450 1B1 (CYP1B1). CYP1B1 is present in normal human bronchial epithelial) cells, and its activity is increased by cigarette smoking. Both 4-OHE(1) and 4-OHE(2) are mutagenic and carcinogenic and may exert their biological effects by inducing DNA adducts in cancer-related genes, including the tumor suppressor gene p53 and the proto-oncogene K-ras. Women with lung cancer have a different p53 mutational spectrum and a higher frequency of K-ras mutations than do men with lung cancer. Both clinical and basic research studies support the hypothesis that E(2) and cigarette smoking are cofactors in lung carcinogenesis in women. More specifically, cigarette smoke stimulates metabolism of E(2) into the genotoxic metabolites, 4-OHE(1) and 4-OHE(2,) which interact with DNA in cancer-related genes, including the tumor suppressor gene, p53, and the proto-oncogene K-ras, two genes frequently mutated in patients with lung cancer. E(2) may stimulate cellular proliferation and enhance tumor growth."

Our earlier findings suggest that women display higher levels of smoking-induced bulky/hydrophobic DNA adducts which may be related to an increased expression of CYP1A1 in their lungs, compared to men. In this in vitro study, 11 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, 6 of male and 5 of female origin, were exposed to benzo[a]pyrene, cigarette smoke condensate (CSC), or vehicle control. Subsequent expression analysis of genes in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bioactivation pathway was conducted with Real-Time RT-PCR. DNA adducts were measured in benzo[a]pyrene-exposed cells by ³²P-postlabelling analysis, and CYP1 activity was measured by EROD assay. Analysis of benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adducts showed higher levels of adducts in cell lines from women compared to cell lines from men (p=0.03). The results also revealed significant sex differences in CYP1A1 gene expression, both in untreated cells (p=0.03), and in cells exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (p=0.017) and cigarette smoke condensate (p=0.0043).

In particular, among life time non-smoker, female are far more likely to develop lung carcinoma than male. Recent studies demonstrated that estrogens are synthesized in situ in both male and female lung cancers through aromatase, suggesting that sex steroid may contribute to the pathogenesis and development of lung carcinoma. In addition, human lung carcinomas have been recently demonstrated to be frequently associated with expression of estrogen receptors in both male and female patients and a lower expression of aromatase was reported to be associated with better prognosis. Preclinical studies further demonstrated that aromatase inhibitor (AI) suppressed the lung tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. These findings all suggest a potential role of intratumoral aromatase in biological behavior of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of human lung malignancy. Therefore, AIs may become viable therapeutic options for disease management in NSCLC patients but further studies are definitely required to obtain a better understanding of the potential roles of intratumoral aromatase expression as a predictive biomarker for clinical outcome in these NSCLC patients."

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded diagnostic biopsies from stage IV patients were obtained and tissue microarrays generated. CXCR4 expression within NSCLC cells was analyzed by quantitative fluorescent immunohistochemistry using the HistoRx PM-2000 platform and then correlated with clinical outcome.Of 832 patients, 170 had samples suitable for tissue microarray generation and analysis. Automated immunohistochemistry for CXCR4 was successfully completed on all 170 patients. High expressors had a significantly poorer median overall survival of 2.7 months versus 5.6 months for the low expressors (p = 0.0468). This difference is driven by high-expressing females who have a median overall survival of 1.6 months versus 6.4 months for the low expressors (p = 0.006).CXCR4 is expressed in the majority of NSCLC tumors, and overexpression is associated with significantly poorer survival in stage IV NSCLC patients.

However, little is known about the experience of symptoms after treatment.The purposes of this study were to (1) examine postchemotherapy (post-CTX) symptom trajectories in cancer survivors and (2) determine whether demographic characteristics predicted symptom trajectories.One hundred patients who recently completed CTX for lung cancer, colorectal cancer, or lymphoma rated symptoms on an electronic patient care monitor system prior to ambulatory care visits. Latent growth curve analyses were conducted to examine the trajectories of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, distress, and depression for 16 months after initial CTX.Symptoms were present at the first follow-up visit following CTX (P < .0001) and persisted over 16 months. The depression trajectory was predicted by sex: males showed a convex curvilinear growth trajectory, whereas females showed a concave trajectory (P < .05). Higher distress was predicted by younger age (P < .05).Psychological and physical symptoms persisted over the 16-month period following CTX for the entire sample. Sex differences in coping could partially explain the different trajectories of growth for depression, but further studies are warranted. Younger patients may be more vulnerable for distress during this posttreatment phase.The posttreatment surveillance plan for cancer survivors should include a comprehensive assessment of psychological and physical symptoms. Persistence of symptoms can be expected in some patients, and supportive interventions should be tailored according to symptom reports."

High cytoplasmic ERβ expression was identified as an independent negative prognostic predictor of overall survival (OS; HR = 1.67), and low total PR was identified as an independent negative predictor of time to progression (TTP; HR = 1.59). After adjusting for stage, age, sex, and smoking, combined high cytoplasmic ERβ and low total PR showed enhanced effects on OS (HR = 2.64) and on TTP (HR = 6.02). Further effects on OS were observed when EGFR expression was included (HR = 5.32). Patients with low cytoplasmic ERβ, low aromatase, low EGFR, and high total PR had shorter OS than patients with the opposite pattern (HR = 6.60). Contribution of these markers to survival showed no significant sex differences in a multivariable model. ERα was elevated in tumors but was not predictive of survival, and appears to represent a variant ERα protein that is only recognized by a C-terminal antibody.Hormonal and EGFR pathways together may contribute to lung cancer prognosis. Lung tumors with high ERβ-1/low PR may define patients with aggressive biology. A validation study is necessary to fully assess the predictive value of these markers."

However the influence of rs3841324 on lung cancer risk has not been studied in depth.We have, therefore, evaluated the association of rs3841324 genotypes with lung cancer risk in a case-control study of 624 Caucasian subjects with lung cancer and 766 age- and sex-matched cancer-free Caucasian controls. We also evaluated the joint effects of rs3841324 with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs16969968 and rs8034191 in the 15q25 region that have been consistently implicated in lung cancer risk.We found that the homozygous genotype with both short alleles (SS) of rs3841324 was associated with a decreased lung cancer risk in female ever smokers relative to the homozygous wild-type (LL) and heterozygous (LS) genotypes combined in a recessive model [OR(adjusted) = 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31-0.89, P = 0.0168].

Women were associated with well/moderate tumor differentiation, a Ki-67 index of 3% or less, and adenocarcinoma histologic features. Female sex predicted increased survival time only by univariate analysis. Stratified by sex, increased survival was noted for women older than 64 years, with a tumor at postsurgical International Union Against Cancer stage I, with adenocarcinoma histologic features, with well- or moderately differentiated tumors, or with a Ki-67 index of 3% or less. Sex is not an independent prognostic parameter for patients with surgically resected NSCLC. Sex-linked differences are associated with other factors, thus simulating a prognostic impact of sex.

These and other data implicate a role for estrogens in lung cancer, particularly nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 61% of human NSCLC tumors express nuclear estrogen receptor β (ERβ); however, the role of ERβ and estrogens in NSCLC is likely to be multifactorial. Here we tested the hypothesis that proteins interacting with ERβ in human lung adenocarcinoma cells that respond proliferatively to estradiol (E2) are distinct from those in non-E2-responsive cells.FLAG affinity purification of FLAG-ERβ-interacting proteins was used to isolate ERβ-interacting proteins in whole cell extracts from E2 proliferative H1793 and non-E2-proliferative A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Following trypsin digestion, proteins were identified using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Proteomic data were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Select results were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation.LC-MS/MS identified 27 non-redundant ERβ-interacting proteins. ERβ-interacting proteins included hsp70, hsp60, vimentin, histones and calmodulin. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the ERβ-interacting proteins revealed differences in molecular and functional networks between H1793 and A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in these and other lung adenocarcinoma cells confirmed that ERβ and EGFR interact in a gender-dependent manner and in response to E2 or EGF. BRCA1 interacted with ERβ in A549 cell lines and in human lung adenocarcinoma tumors, but not normal lung tissue.Our results identify specific differences in ERβ-interacting proteins in lung adenocarcinoma cells corresponding to ligand-dependent differences in estrogenic responses."

This report is a comprehensive analysis of the molecular signature of nonsmoking female lung cancer patients in Taiwan, with a particular focus on the semaphorin gene family.Sixty pairs of tumor and adjacent normal lung tissue specimens were analyzed by using Affymetrix U133plus2.0 expression arrays. Differentially expressed genes in tumor tissues were identified by a paired t test and validated by reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Functional analysis was conducted by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis as well as gene set enrichment analysis and sigPathway algorithms. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to evaluate the association of SEMA5A expression and clinical outcome.We identified 687 differentially expressed genes in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Many of these genes, most notably the semaphorin family, were participants in the axon guidance signaling pathway. The downregulation of SEMA5A in tumor tissue, both at the transcriptional and translational levels, was associated with poor survival among nonsmoking women with NSCLC.In summary, several semaphorin gene family members were identified as potential therapeutic targets, and SEMA5A may be useful as a prognostic biomarker for NSCLC, which may also be gender specific in Taiwanese patients.A novel biomarker for NSCLC is identified."

The etiology of lung cancer is mainly related to cigarette smoking, airborne genotoxic carcinogens, and arsenic, but its sex-specific incidence suggests that other mechanisms, such as hormones, may also be involved in the process of carcinogenesis. A number of agents commonly present in the living environment can have dual biological effects: not only are they genotoxic / carcinogenic, but they are also hormonally active as xenoestrogens. This dualism may explain sex-specific differences reported in both types and incidence of lung cancer. In a novel approach to investigate the complexity of lung cancer, etiology, including systems biology, will be used as a tool for a simultaneous interpretation of measurable environmental and biological parameters. Using this approach, the etiology of human lung cancer can be more thoroughly investigated using the available data from oncology and environmental health. The information gained could be applied in the introduction of preventive measures, in personalized medicine, and in more relevant legislation, which should be adjusted to reflect the current knowledge on the complex environmental interactions underlying this life-threatening disease."

Relevant English-language publications (January 1966-December 2009) on sex differences in lung cancer were identified.Higher levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon DNA adducts were observed in female lung cancer patients compared with their male counterparts, even though the level of tobacco carcinogens was lower among women than among men. DNA repair capacity was found to be lower in female lung cancer patients than in their male counterparts. A higher frequency of G-to-T transversion mutations in the tumor suppressor protein p53 gene has been observed in women compared with men. Non-small cell lung tumors in women appeared to be more likely than those in men to harbor K-ras, c-erbB-2, or epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. Sex differences have been identified in the expression of the cytochrome P4501A1 gene and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor gene, with women exhibiting higher gene expression than men for both of these genes. Evidence supporting a possible association between estrogen and lung cancer risk based on epidemiologic studies has not been consistent, but sex hormones may influence susceptibility to lung carcinogenesis.Women may be more susceptible to tobacco smoke and potentially more vulnerable to lung cancer development. If additional studies yield supporting evidence, researchers, the public, and policy makers should focus on ways to reduce the risk of lung cancer for women."

Our data indicated that a less efficient DNA damage-induced G(2)/M checkpoint was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in African American women with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.63 (95% CI = 1.01-7.26); there were no statistically significant associations for Caucasians, or African American men. When the African American women were categorized into quartiles, a significant reverse trend of decreased G(2)/M checkpoint function and increased lung cancer risk was present, with lowest-vs.-highest quartile OR of 13.72 (95% CI = 2.30-81.92, p(trend) < 0.01). Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis indicated that polymorphisms in ATM, CDC25C, CDKN1A, BRCA2, ERCC6, TP53, and TP53BP1 genes were significantly associated with the gamma-radiation-induced G(2)/M arrest phenotype. This study provides evidence that a less efficient G(2)/M checkpoint is significantly associated with lung cancer risk in African American women.

A gender difference is reported to affect the incidence and mortality of lung cancer; however, whether and how the gender difference is involved in lung cancer metastasis is unclear. This study evaluated the gender difference in multiple organ metastases in human small cell lung cancer (SBC-5) cells by using natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient mice. Among multiple organ metastases, only bone metastasis formation significantly increased in female mice in comparison to males, while no significant difference was observed in the metastases to the liver and lungs. The suppression of androgen by castration or androgen receptor antagonist treatment in male mice also induced a significant increase of bone metastases. The number of osteoclasts in the bone metastatic lesions was greater in female mice and in mice with androgen suppression than in control male. However, there was no significant difference in the serum concentration of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) associated with gender or androgen suppression. An in vitro study also indicated that sex steroid treatment had no effect on the proliferation or PTHrP production in SBC-5 cells. These results indicate that the balance of sex steroids therefore plays an important role in the formation of bone metastasis in small cell lung cancer, and suggests diverse mechanisms of interaction between cancer cells and host cells in the bone microenvironment."

Monitoring the tobacco epidemic via an analysis of lung cancer trends is essential in helping countries arrest the effects of tobacco epidemic in the region. The study aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the temporal patterns of lung cancer mortality in Europe, emphasizing country- and sex-specific differences. National lung cancer mortality data were extracted from the WHO mortality databank by age, sex, year of death (1970-2007) for 36 countries in Europe. Trends in lung cancer mortality in men have tended to decrease in many European countries during the last two decades, particularly in North and Western Europe. Among women, mortality rates are still increasing in many countries, although in a few populations, rates are beginning to stabilize, notably in the high-risk countries within Eastern Europe (Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic), and in Northern Europe (Denmark, Iceland and the United Kingdom). Men and women are clearly in very different phases of the smoking epidemic, and, as reflected in the mortality rates by birth cohort, the stage varies widely by country within each European region. That lung cancer mortality trends in men are on a downwards path in most European countries while female rates continue to rise, points to an urgent need for national and European prevention strategies that target tobacco cessation and prevention among European women."

To test the hypothesis that nuclear localization of ER alpha corresponds to genomic E(2) activity in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females, cell fractionation, immunoblot, and confocal immunohistochemical microscopy were performed. We report for the first time that E(2) increases phospho-serine-118-ER alpha (P-ser118-ER alpha) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) nuclear colocalization in H1793, but not A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, derived from a female and male patient, respectively. ER beta was primarily in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, independent of E(2) treatment, and showed no difference between H1793 and A549 cells. E(2) induced higher transcription of endogenous ER alpha-regulated CCND1 in H1793 than in A549 cells. Likewise, higher rapid, non-genomic E(2)-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation was detected in H1793 compared with A549 cells, linking extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation to increased P-ser118-ER alpha. Furthermore, E(2) increased cyclin D1 and P-ser118-ER alpha nuclear localization in H1793, but not A549 cells. Together, our results indicate that nuclear localization of P-ser118-ER alpha provides one explanation for sex-dependent differences in E(2)-genomic responses in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines."

The PNA-LNA PCR clamp, a highly sensitive detection method for the EGFR mutation, was employed. For fresh cases a portion of samples isolated to establish the diagnosis of lung cancer was used. For cases with a relapsed disease archival tissue were tested. The variables associated with the EGFR mutation after removing the confound factors were investigated by the logistic analysis using the samples collected in our university (n = 308) where detailed information on patients were available. The frequency of the EGFR mutation and its subtypes were investigated using all samples (n = 1,176). The EGFR mutation was significantly associated with adenocarcinoma (p = 0.006) and light-smoking (p < 0.0001), but not gender. The deletions in exon 19 were more frequently associated with male gender while exon 21 deletions were with female gender (p = 0.0011). The overall frequency of the EGFR mutation was 31%. Our result suggests that the female predominance in the EGFR mutation rate is a reflection of a higher frequency of adenocarcinoma in females. The gender difference in the mutation subtypes may provide a clue for the mechanism of the occurrence of the EGFR mutation."

The results showed that of these 48 cases, 18 (37.5%) exhibited high levels of SRC-3 immunoreactivity, 23 (47.9%) exhibited moderate levels of SRC-3 immunoreactivity, and 7 (14.6%) were negative; thus, the total frequency of SRC-3 overexpression was 85.4% (41/48). This SRC-3 overexpression frequency was similar to the overexpression frequency observed for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (82.1% vs 90%) and for metastasis and non-metastasis patients (84.6% vs 85.7%). Data analysis demonstrated a significantly higher overexpression frequency in male patients compared with that in female patients (88.6% vs 76.9%).

Androgen administration altered significantly murine lung gene expression profiles; for example, by up-regulating transcripts involved in oxygen transport and down-regulating those in DNA repair and DNA recombination. Androgen exposure also affected the gene expression profile in a human lung adenocarcinoma-derived cell line, A549, by up- or down-regulating significantly some 200 transcripts, including down-regulation of genes involved in cell respiration. Dexamethasone treatment of A549 cells augmented expression of transcript sets that overlapped in part with those up-regulated by androgen in these cells.

Measures focused on psychosocial resources, treatment decision-making, social consequences of treatments, and treatment outcomes. Data were collected between the fall of 2005 and the summer of 2006.A total of 47 women and 53 men (mean [SD] age, 62.81 [12.01] years; 95% white) completed the needs assessment. Gender was not found to be associated with demographic characteristics, time until diagnosis, treatment, or survival rate. Smoking histories differed significantly in the proportion of women and men who smoked or were former smokers (P = 0.01) as well as the age when they began to smoke (P = 0.02). There were no significant gender differences in social support networks, general coping, information needs, treatment decision satisfaction, functional health, life satisfaction, financial impact, or service needs. However, significant gender differences did indicate that women favored spiritual practices (P = 0.02) and religious coping (P = 0.04), and were more likely to endorse having a life mission (P = 0.03) and being part of a divine plan (P = 0.01).Previous research has found that religiousness and spirituality improved depressive symptoms and may ease end-of-life despair. In the present study of patients with lung cancer, gender differences in religiousness and spirituality suggest that this may be especially true for women, and that interventions should be directed toward their religious practices and coping."
20677562,No," Qianli Ma,",Surgical therapeutic strategy for non-small cell lung cancer with mediastinal lymph node metastasis (N2).,Zhongguo fei ai za zhi ,2010 Apr,Management,Human,173,"Approximately 30% of patients who are diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are classified as N2 on the basis of metastasis to the mediastinal lymph nodes. The effectiveness of surgery for these patients remains controversial. Although surgeries in recent years are proved to be effective to some extent, yet due to many reasons, 5-year survival rate after surgery varies greatly from patient to patient. Thus it is necessary to select patients who have a high probability of being be cured through an operation, who are suitable to receive surgery and the best surgical methods so as to figure out the conditions under which surgical treatment can be chosen and the factors that may influence prognosis.165 out of 173 patients with N2 NSCLC were treated with surgery in our department from January 1999 to May 2003, among whom 130 were male, 43 female and the sex ratio was 3:1, average age 53, ranging from 29 to 79. The database covers the patients' complete medical history including the information of their age, sex, location and size of tumor, date of operation, surgical methods, histologic diagnosis, clinical stage, post-operative TNM stage, neoadjuvant treatment and chemoradiotherapy. The methods of clinical stage verification include chest X-ray, chest CT, PET, mediastinoscopy, bronchoscope (+?), brain CT or MRI, abdominal B ultrasound (or CT), and bone ECT. The pathological classification was based on the international standard for lung cancer (UICC 1997). Survival time was analyzed from the operation date to May 2008 with the aid of SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) program. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Log-rank test and Cox multiplicity were adopted respectively to obtain patients' survival curve, survival rate and the impact possible factors may have on their survival rate.The median survival time was 22 months, with 3-year survival rate reaching 28.1% and 5-year survival rate reaching 19.0%. Age, sex, different histological classification and postoperative chemoradiotherapy seem to have no correlation with 5-year survival rate. In all N2 subtypes, 5-year survival rate is remarkably higher for unexpected N2 discovered at thoractomy and proven N2 stage before preoperative work-up and receive a mediastinal down-staging after induction therapy (P < 0.01), reaching 30.4% and 27.3% respectively. 5-year survival rate for single station lymph node metastasis were 27.8%, much higher compared with 9.3% for multiple stations (P < 0.001). Induction therapy which downstages proven N2 in 73.3% patients gains them the opportunity of surgery. The 5-year survival rate were 23.6% and 13.0% for patients who had complete resection and those who had incomplete resection (P < 0.001). Patients who underwent lobectomy (23.2%) have higher survival rate, less incidence rate of complication and mortality rate, compared with pneumonectomy (14.8%) (P < 0.01). T4 patients has a 5-year survival rate as low as 11.1%, much less than T1 (31.5%) and T2 (24.3%) patients (P = 0.01). It is noted through Cox analysis that completeness of resection, number of positive lymph node stations and primary T status have significant correlativity with 5-year survival rate.It is suggested that surgery (lobectomy preferentially) is the best solution for T1 and T2 with primary tumor have not invaded pleura or the distance to carina of trachea no less than 2 cm, unexpected N2 discovered at thoractomy when a complete resection can be applied, and proven N2 discovered during preoperative work-up and is down-staged after induction therapy. Surgical treatment is the best option, lobectomy should be prioritized in operational methods since ise rate of complication and morality are lower than that of pneumonectomy. Patients' survival time will not benefit from surgery if they are with lymph nodes metastasis of multiple stations (Bulky N2 included) and T4 which can be partially removed. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases long-term survival rate of those with N2 proven prior to surgery. However, postoperative radiotherapy decreases local recurrence rate but does not contribute to patients' long-term survival rate."

Patient selection based on clinical factors is under discussion.We analyzed the outcome in relation to clinical factors of 121 consecutive Caucasian patients treated with erlotinib in a routine clinical setting in a comprehensive cancer center and 2 regional oncology centers.For patients with erlotinib treatment at the 1st/2nd/3rd/> or = 4th line, progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.5/3.5/2.5/3.0 months, and overall survival (OS) was 8.0/8.5/7.8/6.5 months. Patients with adenocarcinoma had an improved PFS, but a similar OS. Never-smokers had longer PFS (7 months) and OS (13 months) than smokers and ex-smokers. Male patients had a slightly longer survival than female patients (PFS 3.0 vs. 2.5 months, OS 8.5 vs. 7.0 months). After adjustment for smoking and histology, the gender difference in OS was significant (adjusted hazard ratio 0.57). Patients with clinically relevant skin toxicity (grade 2, 3) had a significantly prolonged PFS and OS. Patients with partial response on 1st radiological evaluation had a significantly prolonged PFS and OS.Among clinical factors, never-smoking status and male gender predicted a prolonged survival. During treatment, skin toxicity and radiological response were related to better survival."
21070914,Yes," Jun Yokota,",Genetic basis for susceptibility to lung cancer: Recent progress and future directions.,Advances in cancer research,2010,Review,Human,n.a.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and cigarette smoking is the major environmental factor for its development. To elucidate the genetic differences in the susceptibility to lung cancer among individuals, genetic factors involved in tobacco-induced lung cancers have been extensively investigated and a number of genetic polymorphisms have been identified to date as candidates. Most of the polymorphisms identified are of genes encoding proteins associated with the activity to metabolize tobacco smoke carcinogens and to suppress mutations induced by those carcinogens, and functional significances have been elucidated for some of these polymorphisms. However, the significance of these polymorphisms in the contribution to lung cancer development still remains unclear. Recently, several novel lung cancer susceptibility genes, including those on chromosomes 5p15.33, 6p21, and 15q24-25.1, have been identified by large-scale genome-wide association (GWA) studies. The 15q25 region contains three nicotine acetylcholine receptor subunit genes, and their polymorphisms have been also reported as being associated with nicotine dependence. The 5p15.33 region is associated with risks specifically for lung adenocarcinoma, the commonest histological type and weakly associated with smoking. This locus has been shown to be associated with risks for a wide variety of cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma. Associations of the 6q21 region have not been consistently replicated among studies. The 6q23-25 and 13q31.3 regions were also identified by recent GWA studies as being associated with risk for lung cancer, particularly in never-smokers. However, contributions of genetic differences on these five loci to the susceptibility to overall lung cancer seem to be small. There are several molecular pathways for the development of lung adenocarcinomas, and environmental factors for their development are still unclear, especially those in never-smokers. In addition, geographic differences as well as gender differences in lung cancer risk have been indicated. Furthermore, various genes identified by candidate gene association studies have not been reevaluated for their significance together with genes identified by GWA studies in the same population. Therefore, further studies will be necessary to assess the individual susceptibility to lung cancer based on the combination of polymorphisms in multiple genes, and to establish a novel way of evaluating the individual risk for lung cancer for its prevention."

Cases of in-situ carcinoma, extreme age and poor data quality were deliberately excluded, leaving 2,623 newly diagnosed cancers eligible. Vital status of registered cases through 31 December 2008 was confirmed by matching with death certificates and review from the Hospital Information System (HIS) of the only public hospital. Observed survival rates were calculated using a Life Table method, and relative survival rates were examined using an algorithm written in SAS by Paul Dickman with minor adaptations. Apart from general relative survival rates, specific rates by sex and age strata were also estimated.3-year and 5-year relative survival rates of all cancers were 61% and 56% respectively for both sexes; (54% and 47%, respectively, for males and 68% and 64%for females). The 3-year relative survival rates for major cancer sites ranged from 21% to 90%, with lung cancer showing the lowest and female breast cancer the highest. 5-year relative survival rates for major cancer sites ranged from 18% to 85%, with liver cancer showing the lowest and again female breast cancer the highest. Female cancer patients had higher relative survival than males across the 5-year follow up period, with a sex difference of nearly 15%.Comparison of survival rates from this first trial in Macao, deriving survival statistics from population-based cancer registration, with other Asian countries/cities, like Taiwan, Singapore and Japan, showed Macao and Taiwan to have the closest estimates for 3-year relative survival. Random variation was found to exist in the stratification of sex and age in certain cancer sites due to scarce case numbers in the subgroups. It is important to note that the 3-year survival rates are relatively more consistent and reliable than 4-year or 5-year ones. Promotion of reporting cancer stage by physicians as well as improvement in data quality of cancer registration are essential to allow further informative statistics derived from the cancer registry with reference to cancer prevention."

Mean age at the time of diagnosis was 64 years for women and 67 years for men (p = 0.01). Of the patients <55 years of age, 47 (24%) were women and only 65 (14%) were men. Men smoked significantly more than women (median pack-years: 50 vs. 30; p < 0.001). Of the heavy smokers (>40 pack-years), 278 (56%) were men and 68 (33%) were women. More men had squamous cell carcinoma (36%) than women (17%). Conversely, more women presented with adenocarcinoma (48%) than men (27%). No significant sex-associated differences were observed when analyzing first treatments received. Median overall survival was 10 months for both sexes.In Eastern Switzerland, women with lung cancer were younger, more likely to have smoked significantly less and more likely to have adenocarcinoma, compared to men with lung cancer. These findings are consistent with those found in other western populations."

This study aimed to evaluate sex differences in NSCLC in recent years. The true effect of gender on the overall survival was analyzed taking other prognostic factors into account.A cohort of consecutive NSCLC patients was prospectively enrolled from January 2002 to December 2005, and followed-up until December 2006. They were clinically and pathologically staged and underwent homogenous treatment algorithms. Demographics, histology, and disease stage between sexes were compared. The clinical prognostic factors to be analyzed in addition to gender included stage, age, smoking history and histology. The overall survival of females and males within relevant subgroups defined by smoking history and histology was also compared.Of the 738 patients, 695 were analyzed with a definite stage (94.2%; 315 females and 380 males), which was similar in both sexes. Females were younger (median age: 59.5 years vs. 65.0 years; P<0.001) and more likely to have adenocarcinoma (81% vs. 60.5%; P<0.001). Patients with earlier stage, younger patients, never-smokers and females had better overall survival in univariate analyses and no significant survival difference was noted between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Multivariate analyses demonstrated age, smoking history and gender to have a hazard ratio 1.46 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.21-1.76; P<0.001), 1.27 (95% CI 0.97-1.65; P=0.082), and 1.18 (95% CI 0.90-1.55; P=0.226), respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed the survival of never-smoker males with adenocarcinoma was similar to that of females.There are sex-related differences in the clinico-pathologic characteristics and survival of NSCLC patients. The survival advantages of females could be attributed to the younger age and lower smoking prevalence. Never-smokers with adenocarcinoma should be given special attention regardless of sex as they imply better survival with different treatment outcomes."

These genes may thus be of relevance to gender-specific differences in lung cancer risk, particularly in early-onset lung cancer, where a high proportion of women is observed. We conducted a case-control study to investigate genetic polymorphisms in cytochromes that might modify the risk of developing early-onset lung cancer. In total, 638 Caucasian patients under the age of 51 with primary lung cancer and 1300 cancer-free control individuals, matched by age and sex, were included in this analysis. Thirteen polymorphisms in the CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP2A13, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes were analyzed. No significant association was found for any of the analyzed polymorphisms and lung cancer risk overall. However, among women, a significantly increased risk of early-onset lung cancer was observed for carriers of the minor allele of CYP1B1 SNP rs1056836 [odds ratio (OR) 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-2.94; P < 0.001].

More interestingly, MGMT hypermethylation in SCC and ADC was pronouncedly influenced by gender factor, not by smoking status. We questioned whether 17beta-estradiol could modulate the machinery of promoter methylation to cause the gender difference of MGMT hypermethylation in lung cancer.Two MGMT hypermethylated Ch27 and H1355 lung cancer cell lines were treated with or without 17beta-estradiol and the status of hypermethylation was examined by methylated specific methylation (MSP) as compared with both cells treated with demethylating agents, 5-AZA-dC (AZA) or TSA.Our data showed that 17beta-estradiol, similar to AZA, diminished the MGMT hypermethylation and restored MGMT mRNA expression, which was not observed in the case of TSA. Western blotting showed that 17beta-estradiol markedly reduced DNMT1 expression in Ch27 and H1355 cells, but slightly reduced HDAC1 expression. Consequently, acetylated H3 and H4 histone levels were slightly increased by 17beta-estradiol in both cell types. In addition, ChIP analysis revealed that 17beta-estradiol simultaneously diminished the binding activity of both proteins on the MGMT promoter of both cell lines.17beta-Estradiol decreased DNMT1 and HDAC1 protein expressions and their binding activity on MGMT promoter, and this may partially contribute to the gender difference of MGMT hypermethylation in lung cancer."

19250205,No," Diana C M√°rquez-Garb√°n, Richard J Pietras",Targeting aromatase and estrogen signaling in human non-small cell lung cancer.,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2009 Feb,Pathophysiology,Human,na,"Lung cancer has become increasingly common in women, and gender differences in the physiology and pathogenesis of the disease have suggested a role for estrogens. In the lung recent data have shown local production of estrogens from androgens via the action of aromatase enzyme and higher levels of estrogen in tumor tissue as compared with surrounding normal lung tissue. High levels of aromatase expression are also maintained in metastases as compared with primary tumors. Consistent with these findings, clinical studies suggest that aromatase expression may be a useful predictive biomarker for prognosis in the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung malignancy. Low levels of aromatase associate with a higher probability of long-term survival in older women with early stage NSCLC. Treatment of lung NSCLC xenografts in vivo with an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane) alone or combined with standard cisplatin chemotherapy elicits a significant reduction in tumor progression as compared to paired controls. Further, lung cancer progression is also governed by complex interactions between estrogen and growth factor signaling pathways to stimulate the growth of NSCLC as well as tumor-associated angiogenesis. We find that combination therapy with the multitargeted growth factor receptor inhibitor vandetanib and the estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant inhibit tumor growth more effectively than either treatment administered alone.

Its clinical presentation usually corresponds to advanced stages. The indication of screening programs for the diagnosis in early phases has been debated for years.To know the clinical characteristics in the presentation of the lung cancer in our health care area.All of the incident lung cancer cases for 3 years (January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1999) among those patients with usual residence in the Santiago de Compostela health care area were retrospectively collected from the available information in the Codification Service. The histological type was graded according to the World Health Organization classification. Date of death was obtained from the patient's clinical history, mortality record, or telephonic calls to the patient's home. The rest of the information was obtained from the clinical records of the patient and Pathology Service.Four-hundred and eighty-one lung cancer cases were diagnosed (incident gross rate of 41.79 per 100,000 inhabitants and year). Median age was 66.9 years (interquartile range 60.5-74.4), 92.77% being males and 94.1% corresponding to smokers or former smokers. The most prevalent symptoms motivating the visit were general syndrome (20%), thoracic pain (19%) and hemoptisis (17%). A group of patients (56), fundamentally males, had an incidental diagnosis.The incidence of lung cancer seems to be high in our health care area. The standard patient with lung cancer in this health care area is a 67-year-old, male, who smokes, diagnosed in advanced stages, who consults due to a general syndrome and/or chest pain. Some of the symptoms appear with significant gender differences. Likewise, there are differences between histologies, the high frequency of chest pain in adenocarcinoma being outstanding, although it is also the first cause for consultation in small cell lung cancer. On the contrary, hemoptisis, the most frequent consultation cause in squamous cell carcinoma and the general syndrome in the big cells type or with clinical-radiological diagnosis."
19250205,Yes," Diana C M√°rquez-Garb√°n,",Targeting aromatase and estrogen signaling in human non-small cell lung cancer.,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2009 Feb,Review,Human,na,"Lung cancer has become increasingly common in women, and gender differences in the physiology and pathogenesis of the disease have suggested a role for estrogens. In the lung recent data have shown local production of estrogens from androgens via the action of aromatase enzyme and higher levels of estrogen in tumor tissue as compared with surrounding normal lung tissue. High levels of aromatase expression are also maintained in metastases as compared with primary tumors. Consistent with these findings, clinical studies suggest that aromatase expression may be a useful predictive biomarker for prognosis in the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung malignancy. Low levels of aromatase associate with a higher probability of long-term survival in older women with early stage NSCLC. Treatment of lung NSCLC xenografts in vivo with an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane) alone or combined with standard cisplatin chemotherapy elicits a significant reduction in tumor progression as compared to paired controls. Further, lung cancer progression is also governed by complex interactions between estrogen and growth factor signaling pathways to stimulate the growth of NSCLC as well as tumor-associated angiogenesis. We find that combination therapy with the multitargeted growth factor receptor inhibitor vandetanib and the estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant inhibit tumor growth more effectively than either treatment administered alone. Thus, incorporation of antiestrogen treatment strategies in standard antitumor therapies for NSCLC may contribute to improved patient outcome, an approach that deserves to be tested in clinical trials."

Multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to identify predictors of chemotherapy treatment and factors associated with use of cisplatin/carboplatin (platinum) and either a taxane or gemcitabine versus other treatments.Chemotherapy use increased from approximately 28% of Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients diagnosed in 1997 to 36% of patients diagnosed in 2002. Doublet therapy was most commonly used as first-line therapy, received by 74% of chemotherapy-treated patients across all study years. Use of doublet therapy with platinum and either a taxane or gemcitabine also increased over time (with the largest increase for gemcitabine combinations from 0.3% in 1997 to 11.8% in 2002). Males were more likely than females to be treated with chemotherapy (odds ratios [95% CI]: 1.14 [1.06-1.22]), as were patients in the Northeast and South relative to patients in the West (1.24 [1.13-1.36] and 1.33 [1.20-1.47], respectively).Use of first-line chemotherapy treatment among elderly Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients is low, but appears to be increasing, with potential regional and gender differences in treatment.

Descriptive data, together with periodical treatment distribution (surgery, chemotherapy, and others) were analyzed using a Bayesian age, period, and cohort (BAPC) model.Midterm mortality (2-year age-adjusted standardized mortality rate) has been decreasing for male lung cancer patients since about 2000, mainly because of a decrease in incidence during this period. For women, 2-year age-adjusted standardized mortality rate has been slightly increasing, mainly as a result of increasing incidence. There were small improvements (3-6%) in the short-term (1-year) case-fatality rate, possibly owing to increased utilization (approximately 15-18%) of chemotherapy. The midterm (2-year) case-fatality rate remained roughly the same, especially for men.Using a new BAPC model, we found that the trends in mortality for lung cancer paralleled the changes in incidence, with opposite effects in men and women. Increased utilization of chemotherapy might have partly accounted for the small improvement in the case-fatality rate. The contributions of other unmeasured factors such as staging and histologic distribution remain to be clarified in future studies."

However, observational studies regarding menopausal hormone therapy use and lung cancer have given mixed results. Some have associated hormone therapy use with increased lung cancer risk, while others have shown no effect or found lower lung cancer risk in hormone therapy users. Against this background the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized controlled trial evaluating conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in postmenopausal women identified an increase in malignancies in the hormone therapy group during the post intervention period. Post hoc analyses identified a statistically significant increase in deaths from lung cancer for women in the hormone group largely related to effects on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The NSCLCs were more commonly poorly differentiated and were diagnosed at a metastatic stage, suggesting a hormone effect on already established lung cancer growth. Ongoing preclinical and clinical analyses have identified estrogen receptors in the nucleus and cytoplasm of lung tissue and lung cancers. More recently, intriguing associations among estrogen receptor expression, lung cancer histology, clinical prognosis, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations have been reported. The WHI clinical findings should be integrated into risk-benefit discussion with women considering combined hormone therapy use. In addition, the findings, together with ongoing studies evaluating estrogen receptor status and function, support further efforts to develop lung cancer intervention strategies targeting estrogen receptor expression."

Multiple analyses have demonstrated a survival advantage in women regardless of stage, histology, or treatment. The etiology for the improved prognosis is not yet fully elucidated, but is likely related to underlying biologic differences, including hormonal interactions. More recently, gender differences in response to newer agents such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors and anti-angiogenesis agents have been identified.

While historically, more men than women have died from lung cancer as a result of higher numbers of male smokers, the sex mortality ratio is now showing signs of narrowing. Tumors in women with lung cancer may be slightly different to those in men with lung cancer. This review focuses on biomarkers differentially expressed between female and male patients with lung cancer. There is variation in gene expression between men and women in some genes that encode carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A1, GSTM). Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), a bombesin-like peptide, is present in two actively transcribed alleles in women compared with men. Higher prevalence of infection with oncogenic variants human papilloma viruses (HPVs) HPV16 and HPV18 has been suggested in women. A higher frequency of G to T transversion was found in the p53 gene in lung tumors of women. KRAS mutation was found to be more frequent in women with resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) than in men with resected NSCLC. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is more frequently found in lung tumors from women, but the confounding effect of tobacco exposure may explain this difference. Lower levels of ERCC1 and BRCA1 have been reported in women with NSCLC. Lung tumors from women are more likely to express estrogen receptors than those from men. An in silico analysis of transcriptome datasets from lung cancer patients demonstrated that only seven genes (in at least two studies) had significantly different expression patterns in male versus female patients. All of these genes are localized on the sex chromosomes: one on chromosome X and six on chromosome Y. Many areas remain under debate and there are still significant gaps in our understanding, particularly how sex-linked factors relate to lung cancer risk, and to biological and clinical behaviors. Future research into lung cancer needs to address these gender differences more specifically."

Without a doubt, lung cancer is a major health problem for women in the USA, not only owing to its high incidence rate but, more alarming, the high mortality rate. Lung cancer kills more women each year than breast, ovarian and uterine cancers combined. One of the most important risk factors for the development of lung cancer in both men and women is cigarette smoking. Unfortunately, the prevalence of smoking among women has increased significantly since 1980, which is a major concern as epidemiologic data suggest that women may be more susceptible to developing lung cancer than men. Many will argue, however, that after adjusting for tobacco exposure, some studies have failed to show that women are at a higher risk for developing lung cancer. Indeed, the increased risk of lung cancer in women remains controversial. There is, however, little controversy to the fact that the biology of lung cancer differs between the sexes. This paper summarizes the explanations for the sex differences in lung cancer, including differences in molecular abnormalities, growth factor receptors, hormonal influences, differences in cytochrome P-450 enzymes and DNA repair capacity, as well as variations in treatment outcomes."

19570225,No," Massimo Bilancia,","Geographical clustering of lung cancer in the province of Lecce, Italy: 1992-2001.",International journal of health geographics,2009,Epidemiology,Human,n.a.,"The triennial mortality rates for lung cancer in the two decades 1981-2001 in the province of Lecce, Italy, are significantly higher than those for the entire region of Apulia (to which the Province of Lecce belongs) and the national reference rates. Moreover, analyzing the rates in the three-year periods 1993-95, 1996-98 and 1999-01, there is a dramatic increase in mortality for both males and females, which still remains essentially unexplained: to understand the extent of this phenomenon, it is worth noting that the standardized mortality rate for males in 1999-01 is equal to 13.92 per 10000 person-years, compared to a value of 6.96 for Italy in the 2000-2002 period.These data have generated a considerable concern in the press and public opinion, which with little scientific reasoning have sometimes identified suspected culprits of the risk excess (for example, the emission caused by a number of large industrial sites located in the provinces of Brindisi and Taranto, bordering the Province of Lecce). The objective of this paper is to study on a scientifically sound basis the spatial distribution of risk for lung cancer mortality in the province of Lecce. Our goal is to demonstrate that most of the previous explanations are not supported by data: to this end, we will follow a hybrid approach that combines both frequentist and Bayesian disease mapping methods. Furthermore, we define a new sequential algorithm based on a modified version of the Besag-York-Mollié (BYM) model, suitably modified to detect geographical clusters of disease.Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for lung cancer in the province of Lecce: For males, the relative risk (measured by means of SMR, i.e. the ratio between observed and expected cases in each area under internal standardization) was judged to be significantly greater than 1 in many municipal areas, the significance being evaluated under the null hypothesis of neutral risk on the ground of area-specific p-values (denoted by rhoi); in addition, it was seen that high risk areas were not randomly distributed within the province, but showed a sharp clustering. The most perceptible cluster involved a collection of municipalities around the Maglie area (Istat code: 75039), while the association among the municipalities of Otranto, Poggiardo and Santa Cesarea Terme (Istat codes: 75057, 75061, 75072) was more ambiguous. For females, it was noteworthy the significant risk excess in the city of Lecce (Istat code: 75035), where an SMR of 1.83 and rhoi < 0.01 have been registered. BYM model for the province of Lecce: For males, Bayes estimates of relative risks varied around an overall mean of 1.04 with standard deviation of 0.1, with a minimum of 0.77 and a maximum of 1.25. The posterior relative risks for females, although smoothed, showed more variation than for males, ranging form 0.74 to 1.65, around a mean of 0.90 with standard deviation 0.12. For males, 95% posterior credible intervals of relative risks included unity in every area, whereas significantly elevated risk of mortality was confirmed in the Lecce area for females (95% posterior CI: 1.33 - 2.00). BYM model for the whole Apulia: For males, internally standardized maps showed several high risk areas bordering the province of Lecce, belonging to the province of Brindisi, and the presence of a large high risk region, including the southern part of the province of Brindisi and the eastern and southern part of the Salento peninsula, in which an increasing trend in the north-south direction was found.Ecological correlation study with deprivation (Cadum Index): For males, posterior mean of the ecological regression coefficient beta resulted to be 0.04 with 95% posterior credible interval equal to (-0.01, 0.08); similarly, beta was estimated as equal to -0.03 for females (95% posterior credible interval: -0.16, 0.10). Moreover, there was some indication of nonlinearly increasing relative risk with increasing deprivation for higher deprivation levels. For females, it was difficult to postulate the existence of any association between risk and deprivation.Cluster detection: cluster detection based on a modified BYM model identified two large unexplained increased risk clusters in the central-eastern and southern part of the peninsula. Other secondary clusters, which raise several complex interpretation issues, are present.Our results reduce the alleged role of the industrial facilities located around the province of Taranto: in particular, air pollution produced around the city of Taranto (which lies to the west of the province of Lecce) has been often identified as the main culprit of the mortality excess, a conclusion that was further supported by a recent study on the direction of prevailing winds on Salento. This hypothesis is contradicted by the finding that those municipalities that directly border on the province of Taranto (belonging to the so-called ""Jonico-Salentina"" band) are those that present low mortality rates (at least for males). In the same way, the responsibilities of energy production plants located in the province of Brindisi (Brindisi province lies to the north) appear to be of little relevance. For females, given the situation observed in the city of Lecce, and given the substantial increase in mortality observed in younger age classes, further investigation is required into the role played by changes in lifestyle, including greater net propensity to smoke that women have shown since the 80s onwards (a phenomenon which could be amplified in a city traditionally cultured and modern as Lecce, as the tobacco habit is a largely cultural phenomenon). For males, the presence of high levels of deprivation throughout the eastern and southern Salento is likely to play an important role: those with lower socio-economic status smoke more, and gender differences may be explained on the basis of the fact that in less developed areas women have less habit to tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking (and other harmful lifestyles), which are seen as purely masculine behaviour: research into the role of material deprivation and individual lifestyle differences between genders should be further developed."

At 10 weeks, female mice had more than twice the number of tumors evident on the surface of the lungs than male mice; ovariectomy eliminated this sex difference. The estrogen treatment significantly increased tumor number and volume in ovariectomized females and in males. Histological character of the tumors ranged from adenoma to adenocarcinoma. Ovary-intact females exhibited higher grade tumors than ovariectomized females or males. Progression to higher histological grade was stimulated by estrogen in male mice but not in ovariectomized females. At 10 weeks after AdeCre administration, tumor cell Ki67-labeling varied widely, precluding assessment of an estrogen effect; however, at 4 weeks, Ki67 labeling of lung parenchymal cells was increased 3.5-fold by estrogen.

Trends were analyzed using joinpoint regression models.In 2005 in Spain, 16 647 men and 2471 women died from lung cancer, accounting for 26.6% and 6.6%, respectively, of all cancer deaths. In men, truncated mortality rates initially increased in the 1980-1992 period (3.1% per year; P<.05) but began to decrease in the 1992-2005 period (-0.8% per year, P<.05). Starting in the 1990s, age-specific mortality rates showed a statistically significant decrease in patients aged less than 85 years. For women, after an initial stable period, truncated mortality rates increased significantly from 1992 onward by 6.3% per year. The analysis by age groups showed that the rates increased in all age groups, except for patients aged 25 to 34 years and patients aged 75 to 84 years, in whom they remained stable.While lung cancer mortality began to decrease slightly among Spanish men 15 years ago, it increased significantly among women during the same period."

Accurate gene expression signatures are needed to classify patients into high- and low-risk groups to improve the selection of patients for adjuvant therapy.Multiple published microarray data sets were used to evaluate our previously identified lung cancer prognostic gene signature. Expression of the signature genes was further validated with real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot assays of snap-frozen lung cancer tumor tissues.Our previously identified 35-gene signature stratified 264 patients with NSCLC into high- and low-risk groups with distinct overall survival rates (P < 0.05, Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank tests). The 35-gene signature further stratified patients with clinical stage 1A diseases into poor prognostic and good prognostic subgroups (P = 0.0007, Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank tests). This signature is independent of other prognostic factors for NSCLC, including age, sex, tumor differentiation, tumor grade, and tumor stage. The expression of the signature genes was validated with real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of lung cancer tumor specimens. Protein expression of two signature genes, TAL2 and ILF3, was confirmed in lung adenocarcinoma tumors by using Western blot analysis. These two biomarkers showed correlated mRNA and protein overexpression in lung cancer development and progression.The results indicate that the identified 35-gene signature is an accurate predictor of survival in NSCLC. It provides independent prognostic information in addition to traditional clinicopathologic criteria."

The design of better therapies for lung cancer patients would be greatly aided by good mouse models that closely resemble the human disease. Unfortunately, current models for lung adenocarcinoma are inadequate due to the absence of metastases. In this study, we incorporated both K-ras and p53 missense mutations into the mouse genome and established a more faithful genetic model for human lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of lung cancer. Mice with both mutations developed advanced lung adenocarcinomas that were highly aggressive and metastasized to multiple intrathoracic and extrathoracic sites in a pattern similar to that of human lung cancer. These mice also showed a gender difference in cancer-related death. Additionally, the presence of both mutations induced pleural mesotheliomas in 23% of these mice. This mouse model recapitulates the metastatic nature of human lung cancer and will be invaluable to further probe the molecular basis of metastatic lung cancer and for translational studies."

In the present study, we demonstrate unique accumulation of 4-MeOE(2), as a result of TCDD/E(2) interaction and revealed its bioactivity in human lung epithelial cell line (H1355). 4-Methoxyestradiol treatment significantly decreased cell growth and increased mitotic index. Elevation of ROS and SOD activity, with a concomitant decrease in the intracellular GSH/GSSG ratio, was also detected in 4-MeOE(2)-treated cells. Quantitative comet assay showed increased oxidative DNA damage in the 4-MeOE(2)-treated H1355 cells, which could be significantly reduced by the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). However, inhibition of cell growth and increase in mitotic arrest induced by 4-MeOE(2) were unaffected by NAC. We concluded that 4-MeOE(2) accumulation resulting from TCDD and E(2) interaction would contribute to the higher vulnerability on lung pathogenesis in females when exposed to TCDD."

Smoking topography data indicated that, compared with men, women took smaller puffs (37.6 ml/puff vs. 45.8 ml/puff; p = .0001) of shorter duration (1.33 s/puff vs. 1.48 s/puff; p = .002) but drew more puffs per cigarette (13.5 vs. 12.0; p = .001) and left longer butts (36.3 mm or 40.2% of cigarette length vs. 34.3 mm or 39.2% of cigarette length; p = .01). These trends were similar in both African Americans and European Americans. The emissions of select toxins per cigarette, as determined by mimicking human smoking behaviors were greater among the male smokers than the female smokers and correlated significantly with delivered smoke volume per cigarette. The geometric means of emissions of nicotine from cigarettes were 1.92 mg/cigarette (95% CI = 1.80-2.05) for women versus 2.20 (95% CI = 2.04-2.37) for men (p = .005). Cigarettes smoked by women yielded 139.5 ng/cigarette of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK; 95% CI = 128.8-151.0), compared with 170.3 ng/cigarette (95% CI = 156.3-185.6) for men (p = .0007); benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) emissions were 18.0 ng/cigarette (95% CI = 17.0-19.0) for women and 20.5 ng/cigarette (95% CI = 18.8-22.3) for men (p = .01). The gender differences with regard to cigarette smoke yields of toxins were more profound in European Americans than in African Americans. On average, African American men's smoking habits produced the highest emissions of select toxins from cigarettes, and European American female smokers had the lowest exposure to carcinogens and toxins. Several studies have suggested that women may be more susceptible than men to the ill effects of carcinogens in tobacco and tobacco smoke, whereas other studies have not found differences in lung cancer risk between men and women. The present study suggests that gender differences in exposure to tobacco smoke cannot account for a higher rate of lung cancer in female smokers compared with male smokers."

Does Vitamin D from the sun play a role?,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2007 Mar,Outcomes,Human,15616,"Vitamin D derivatives can modulate proliferation and differentiation of cancer cells. Our main source of Vitamin D is ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced synthesis in skin following sun exposure. UV measurements show that the ambient annual UV exposures increase by about 50% from north to south in Norway. As judged from the incidence rates of squamous cell carcinoma, the same is true for the average personal UV exposures. Solar ultraviolet B (UVB) (280-320nm) exhibits a strong seasonal variation with a minimum during the winter months. The present work aims at investigating the impact of season of diagnosis and residential region, both influencing the Vitamin D level, on the risk of death from lung cancer in patients diagnosed in Norway. Data on all incident cases of lung cancer between 1964 and 2000 were collected. Risk estimates were calculated as relative risk (RR), with 95% confidence intervals using Cox regression model. The seasonal variation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was assessed from routine measurements of 15,616 samples performed at The Hormone Laboratory of Aker University Hospital. Our results indicate that season of diagnosis is of prognostic value for lung cancer patients, with a approximately 15% lower case fatality for young male patients diagnosed during autumn versus winter (RR=0.85; 95% CI, -0.73 to 0.99; p=0.04). Residing in a high UV region resulted in a further lowering of the death risk than residing in a low UV region. We propose, in agreement with earlier findings for prostate-, breast- colon cancer and Hodgkins lymphoma, that a high level of sun-induced 25-hydroxyvitamin D can be a prognostic advantage for certain groups of lung cancer patients, notably for young men. Lung cancer has for several decades been the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men in Norway and during the last two decades, became the second most common cause of cancer-related death in women . There are two main types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer for which chemotherapy is the primary treatment and non-small cell lung cancer, which in its early stages is treated primarily with surgery. Gender-related differences have been described in the literature with respect to survival after therapy, male gender being a significant independent negative prognostic factor . In Norway the 5 years relative survival for localized tumours is about 30% for females and 20% for males. Calcitriol, which is the most active form of Vitamin D, is involved in key regulatory processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in a wide variety of cells . Mechanisms for these actions have been proposed to be the interaction of active Vitamin D derivatives with a specific nuclear receptor (VDR receptor) and/or with membrane targets . In vitro studies, performed with lung cancer cell lines, have shown an inhibitive effect of Vitamin D derivatives on cell-growth and proliferation . Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated the capability of these compounds to suppress invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis in vivo , suggesting that administration of Vitamin D derivatives may be used as adjuvant therapy for lung cancer. Humans get optimal Vitamin D levels by exposure to sun or artificial ultraviolet B (UVB, 280-320nm) sources , and possibly also by consumption of food rich in this nutrient (fat fish, eggs, margarine, etc.) or of vitamin supplements . Among these sources, solar radiation appears to be the most important one . Thus, the Vitamin D status (assessed by the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcidiol) exhibits a strong seasonal variation that parallels the seasonal change in the fluence of solar UVB that reaches the ground. During winter, the UVB fluence rate in the Nordic countries (50-71 degrees N) is below the level required for Vitamin D synthesis in skin . The maximal level of calcidiol is reached between the months July and September, and is 20-120% higher than the corresponding winter level . Recently we hypothesised that the seasonal variation of calcidiol might be of prognostic significance for colon-, breast- prostate cancer as well as for Hodgkins lymphoma in Norway. Patients diagnosed during summer and autumn have a better survival after standard treatment than patients diagnosed during the winter season . This might be a consequence of a higher Vitamin D level. An American study investigated the effect of season of surgery and recent Vitamin D intake on the survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients. The authors reported a significant beneficial joint effect of summer season and high Vitamin D intake compared with winter season and low Vitamin D intake while Vitamin D intake alone did not affect prognosis. Similar results were recently reported from a large study in United Kingdom involving over a million cancer patients including over 190,000 patients diagnosed with lung cancer . Norway (58-71 degrees N) has a significant north-south variation in UV fluence. This makes the country suitable for studies relating cancer epidemiology to UV levels . We investigated whether variations in UV, and, consequently, in Vitamin D level, influence the prognosis of lung cancer, using season of diagnosis and residential regions as variables. Survival data obtained for patients diagnosed over a 40 years period were compared with variations in serum Vitamin D levels obtained from routine measurements performed in The Hormone Laboratory of Aker University Hospital during the period 1996-2001. Seasonal and gender variations in Vitamin D level have been estimated from the analyses."

To assess an interactions between two factors, odds ratios for interaction (ORis) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by case-only contingency table.A statistically significant ORi was observed between a family history of breast cancer in first-degree relatives (parent and siblings, not including children) and the sex of a patient (ORi: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.02-4.81). A stratified analysis by histologic subtypes showed a statistically significant ORi only for adenocarcinoma (ORi: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.19-8.98). No other family history of cancer, such as stomach, colon and lung cancer, showed a statistically significant ORi.This study suggests the possibility of gene-sex interaction in lung cancer."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain unclear. In the present study, we have evaluated the roles of CYP1A1 and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DDH) in the formation of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) DNA adducts in various lung cancer cell lines. Among six lung cancer cell lines tested, higher adduct levels were observed in CL-3 and CL1-1 cells, which had relatively high expression of both CYP1A1 and DDH isoform 1 (DHH1). To determine whether a reduction in DDH expression changed the adduct levels, an siRNA was used to knock down DDH1 expression in CL-3 cells. The BaP adduct levels in siDDH-CL-3 cells increased 1.4-2.2-fold relative to that of the parental CL-3 cells. We also examined BaP-like DNA adducts, and CYP1A1 and DDH1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 120 lung tumors. Detection of DNA adducts correlated with CYP1A1-positive tumors (P = 0.023), but not with DDH1-positive tumors. In addition, 28 of 33 tumors (85%) that were CYP1A1-positive and DDH1-negative contained detectable levels of DNA adducts, a proportion that was higher than for tumors from the other three categories of CYP1A1 and DDH1 expression (P = 0.012). Finally, a greater proportion of adduct-positive tumors from females were CYP1A1-positive/DDH1-negative (45.3%) than were tumors from males (27.3%).

Greater than expected improvements in male death rates with respect to heart disease, lung cancer, accidents and violence (excluding suicide) explain a large part of this phenomenon.

Women have lower mortality rates than men. The sex ratio of mortality is cause-specific and differs markedly between populations. Assuming that the genetic differences between the sexes are very similar between populations implies that the differences in the sex ratio cannot be explained by genetic factors. Gender differences in smoking levels exert a strong influence on the sex ratio of lung cancer, total cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The sex ratio of mortality decreases with age. The mortality rates between the genders are highly significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) both at younger and older age classes, except for lung cancer in the 45-74 y age class. This demonstrates that identical factors influence the mortality rates of both genders, but at a lower level in women."

Mortality trends depend on a number of factors including exposures, health system interventions, and possibly artefact (e.g. classification change, variations of data completeness). Descriptive data on mortality only allow for generation of hypotheses to explain observed trends. Some clues on the respective role of possible mortality determinants may be found comparing mortality with incidence and survival data.Mortality data for the periods 1978-1993 and 1994-2004 were supplied by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and the Regional Causes of Death Registry (ReNCaM) respectively. Sex and site-specific mortality time trends were analysed by the ""joinpoint regression"" method.For all sites combined, in both sexes, the standardised rate was first increasing before the end of the eighties and decreasing thereafter. Gastric cancer mortality showed a different trend by gender; that is the rate constantly decreased over the period among females while, for males, it was first increasing up to 1985 and decreasing thereafter. Liver cancer trend showed a pattern similar to gastric cancer. Large bowel cancer showed a gender specific trend, that is it was increasing among males and stable among females. Also lung cancer mortality varied by gender: it started to decline after 1989 among males but was steadily increasing over the study period among women. A decreasing trend for female breast cancer mortality began in 1994. Prostate cancer mortality trend is the only one showing two significant joinpoints: mortality decreased up to 1990, then it increased up to 1998 and, finally, was decreasing.Overall cancer mortality was decreasing in both sexes in Umbria and this favourable trend will probably continue and further improve since population screening against breast, cervix, and large bowel cancers were recently introduced. Besides gastric cancer, tobacco-related cancers and prostate cancer mainly contributed to mortality reduction in males, whereas breast cancer mainly contributed to declining mortality in females."

This could be related to sex differences in nicotine metabolism and related smoking behavior. This study tested the hypothesis that women metabolize nicotine more rapidly than men and that, among women, oral contraceptive users metabolize nicotine more rapidly than nonusers of oral contraceptives.Two hundred seventy-eight healthy volunteers who were twins and 16 who were siblings of twins, recruited from the Northern California Twin Registry, received an infusion of deuterium-labeled nicotine and cotinine with frequent blood sampling. The plasma clearances of nicotine and cotinine, the clearance of nicotine to cotinine (an index of cytochrome P450 [CYP] 2A6 activity), and the ratio of trans-3'-hydroxycotinine to cotinine (another indicator of CYP2A6 activity) were measured.The clearances of nicotine and cotinine, the clearance of nicotine to cotinine, and the trans-3'-hydroxycotinine/cotinine ratio were significantly higher in women than in men (nicotine clearance, 15.6 +/- 4.3 mL.min(-1).kg(-1) in men versus 18.8 +/- 6.6 mL.min(-1).kg(-1) in women; P < .001); they were also higher among women taking oral contraceptives than in those who were not taking oral contraceptives (nicotine clearance, 22.5 +/- 6.6 mL.min(-1).kg(-1) in women taking oral contraceptives versus 17.6 +/- 6.1 mL.min(-1).kg(-1) in those who were not; P < .05). Women who were menopausal or postmenopausal were not different from men. Among oral contraceptive users, nicotine metabolism was accelerated among those taking combined and estrogen-only contraceptives but not progesterone-only contraceptives.Sex hormones influence nicotine metabolism. Nicotine and cotinine metabolism is faster in women than in men and is faster in women taking oral contraceptives compared with those who are not. Accelerated nicotine metabolism appears to be a result of estrogen. Sex-related differences in nicotine clearance could affect smoking behaviors, as well as response to nicotine medications, and could be a marker for altered metabolism of nicotine-derived carcinogens."

In a subset of 256 smokers, there remained a lower prevalence of COPD in women compared to men (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.77; p = 0.003). Adjusted analysis to control for age and number of pack-years of smoking in this subset again showed a sustained reduction in the OR for women presenting with COPD (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.83; p = 0.009).When COPD was examined as an end point among patients who had newly diagnosed lung cancer, a significantly higher proportion of women had normal PFT results. Gender-based differences on PFT results should be considered during the screening of lung cancer, because the stratification of high-risk patients based on the presence of COPD may miss a significant proportion of women with lung cancer."
16678549,No," Neal L Benowitz,",Female sex and oral contraceptive use accelerate nicotine metabolism.,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2006 May,Pathophysiology,Human,294,"Several studies have reported that female smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer than male smokers. This could be related to sex differences in nicotine metabolism and related smoking behavior. This study tested the hypothesis that women metabolize nicotine more rapidly than men and that, among women, oral contraceptive users metabolize nicotine more rapidly than nonusers of oral contraceptives.Two hundred seventy-eight healthy volunteers who were twins and 16 who were siblings of twins, recruited from the Northern California Twin Registry, received an infusion of deuterium-labeled nicotine and cotinine with frequent blood sampling. The plasma clearances of nicotine and cotinine, the clearance of nicotine to cotinine (an index of cytochrome P450 [CYP] 2A6 activity), and the ratio of trans-3'-hydroxycotinine to cotinine (another indicator of CYP2A6 activity) were measured.The clearances of nicotine and cotinine, the clearance of nicotine to cotinine, and the trans-3'-hydroxycotinine/cotinine ratio were significantly higher in women than in men (nicotine clearance, 15.6 +/- 4.3 mL.min(-1).kg(-1) in men versus 18.8 +/- 6.6 mL.min(-1).kg(-1) in women; P < .001); they were also higher among women taking oral contraceptives than in those who were not taking oral contraceptives (nicotine clearance, 22.5 +/- 6.6 mL.min(-1).kg(-1) in women taking oral contraceptives versus 17.6 +/- 6.1 mL.min(-1).kg(-1) in those who were not; P < .05). Women who were menopausal or postmenopausal were not different from men. Among oral contraceptive users, nicotine metabolism was accelerated among those taking combined and estrogen-only contraceptives but not progesterone-only contraceptives.Sex hormones influence nicotine metabolism. Nicotine and cotinine metabolism is faster in women than in men and is faster in women taking oral contraceptives compared with those who are not. Accelerated nicotine metabolism appears to be a result of estrogen. Sex-related differences in nicotine clearance could affect smoking behaviors, as well as response to nicotine medications, and could be a marker for altered metabolism of nicotine-derived carcinogens."

For those causes showing a statistically significant increase a spatial analysis on a group of municipalities around Massa and Carrara has been carried out.Mortality for all causes, and for 30 specific causes.The study results confirm, for the years 1995-2000, the previous observation (1990-1994) of statistically significant excesses for mortality from all causes (SMR 109), all cancers (SMR 112), respiratory diseases (SMR 126), cirrhosis (SMR 226), liver (SMR 161) and lung cancer (SMR 115) in males. A statistically significant excess for larynx (SMR 158) and pleural cancer (SMR 178) is observed in the years 1995-2000, which was not present in 1990-1994. A mortality excess for cirrhosis is confirmed in females (SMR 158) and a new one emerges for liver cancer (SMR 144). The comparison between mortality data for the periods 1995-2000 and 1990-1994 has shown a statistically significant decrease in mortality for all causes and for several specific causes, a significant increase in liver (CMF males 1.35; CMF females 1.78) and blood cancer mortality is also detected (CMF females 1.44).This study confirms the negative health impact of environmental, occupational exposures in populations living in areas where high-risk factories are located. Adverse health effects are stronger in socially and economically deprived areas, and persist over many years after closing polluting industrial plants. The results of this study point out to the need of health promoting actions aiming at modifying lifestyle risk factors, ameliorating socio-economic conditions, and maintaining a constant control on environment, also through a specific environmental epidemiological surveillance to monitor the impact of reclamation procedures completed or in progress."

In 2000, the mortality rate for lung cancer among women was higher than that for breast cancer.To obtain overall risk for intensity of smoking for both males and females, a meta-analysis was performed on recent studies that assessed the morbidity and mortality associated with smoking.Using the PubMed database, a literature search was conducted for cohort and case-control studies on the effect of smoking on morbidity and mortality. Only studies that had quantified the risk of disease associated with smoking were included. Nineteen studies were selected, with data obtained on the disease affected by smoking, point estimates of risk, 95% CIs, sample size, type of study, and the number of patients of each sex. Meta-analyses were performed for low level of use, defined as 1 to 20 cigarettes per day, and for high level of use, >20 cigarettes per day.For low level of use, the rate ratio point estimate of 1.77 (95% CI, 1.40-2.24) for females was higher than that of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.23-1.64) for males, indicating a gender effect associated with smoking as a disease risk. The point estimate for females who smoked at high levels was 2.75 (95% CI, 2.14-3.52), well beyond the estimate of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.70-2.24) for males, indicating there was a substantial gender effect with high-level use. All point estimates for low and high levels of smoking were significant; those for each sex at high levels of smoking exceeded those found for low levels. The increase in risk from low to high levels of smoking was greater for females than for males.Few systems in the body were unaffected by smoking, and intensity was a risk factor for disease. Results were consistent with and strengthened previous research demonstrating an increase in overall risk with an increase in smoking intensity. In addition, gender differences were noted that may contribute to risk magnitude."

Smokers with > or =10 cigarettes per day and serum cotinine > or =25 ng/mL were eligible for the study. B(a)P-DNA adduct level was the outcome. The randomization was stratified by gender and cigarettes per day (< or =20 or >20). Smoking habits and blood samples were collected every 3 months during the 15-month treatment period. Samples were analyzed for B(a)P-DNA adducts (high-performance liquid chromatography), plasma cotinine, vitamin levels, and GSTM1 genotype. The intent-to-treat model adjusted for B(a)P-DNA and cotinine at randomization.Overall and among men, there was no effect of treatment on B(a)P-DNA adduct levels. Among treated women, B(a)P-DNA adducts decreased by 31% compared with women on placebo (P = 0.03). Among treated women with the GSTM1 genotype, there was a 43% decrease in adducts (P = 0.04).Our primary hypothesis that the mean level of smoking-related B(a)P-DNA adducts would be lower in all subjects in the vitamin treatment group compared with all placebo-treated subjects was not substantiated. However, oursecondary gender-specific analysis found a significant reduction in B(a)P-DNA adducts in women with vitamin treatment, suggesting that antioxidant supplementation maymitigate some of the procarcinogenic effects of exposuretoB(a)P.

Here, we investigated the relationship between EGFR mutation and clinicopathologic features.EGFR mutational status of 120 NSCLCs was determined mainly in EGFR exons 18 to 21 by direct sequence and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters.EGFR mutations were present in 38 cases (32%) and the majority of mutations were in-frame deletions of exon 19 (19 cases) and a missense mutation in exon 21 (18 cases). EGFR mutations were frequently associated with adenocarcinoma (P < 0.0001), never smoker (P < 0.0001), and female gender (P = 0.0001). Of interest, increasing smoke exposure was inversely related to the rate of EGFR mutation (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that smoking and histology were independent variables. Furthermore, gender difference was observed for the mutational location (P = 0.01) dominance of exon 19 for males and exon 21 for females. Twenty-one cases were treated with gefitinib and found that EGFR mutation was significantly related to gefitinib responsiveness (P = 0.002). In addition, median survival times of patients with and without EGFR mutations treated with gefitinib were 25.1 and 14.0 months, respectively. Patients with EGFR mutations had approximately 2-fold survival advantage; however, the difference was not significant.We show that EGFR mutations were significantly related to histology and smoke exposure and were a strong predictive factor for gefitinib responsiveness in NSCLC."

Additionally, ER hypermethylation in lung tumors has been associated with the exposure of specific carcinogens in animal study. The role of hypermethylation-induced ER transcription silencing in lung tumor progression and its prognostic value for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients remained unclear. In our study, ER hypermethylation of 123 lung tumors and adjacent normal parts were examined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Estrogen receptor mRNA expression in lung tumors was determined by RT-PCR. Our data indicated that ER hypermethylation was only detected in lung tumors, but not in adjacent normal lung tissues. This suggests that ER hypermethylation may be associated with lung tumorigenesis. Among the clinical parameters studied, only gender factor was correlated with ER hypermethylation with a higher frequency of ER hypermethylation being in male patients than in female patients (58 vs. 34%, p = 0.01). After being stratified by gender and cigarette smoking status, a similarly high prevalence of ER hypermethylation was found in male smoking and nonsmoking patients (60 vs. 61%) as compared to that of female nonsmoking patients (34%). To investigate if 17-beta estradiol (E2) was responsible for such gender difference in ER hypermethylation, a lung cancer A549 cell with ER hypermethylation and without ER mRNA expression was treated with E2 of various concentrations for defined time intervals to show that an E2 treatment could restore the expression of ER mRNA and eliminate ER hypermethylation. Western blot data also showed that acetylated histone 3 and histone 4 of chromatin were increased significantly by E2 treatment. Thus, E2 can make ER mRNA re-expression by eliminating ER hypermethylation. To elucidate the prognostic value of ER hypermethylation, Kaplan-Meier analysis was carried out to show that patients with ER hypermethylation had a poorer prognosis than those without ER hypermethylation. Such prognostic prediction, however, applied only to male (p = 0.0044) patients. Cox regression analysis further showed the feasibility of ER hypermethylation as an independent prognostic factor of NSCLC (p = 0.007). It is possible that antiestrogens may have different therapeutic values for male and female lung cancer patients."

Such prognostic prediction, however, applied only to male (p = 0.0044) patients. Cox regression analysis further showed the feasibility of ER hypermethylation as an independent prognostic factor of NSCLC (p = 0.007). It is possible that antiestrogens may have different therapeutic values for male and female lung cancer patients."

Several case-control studies suggested that women have greater risk of lung cancer compared with men at similar levels of cigarette smoking, whereas some large cohort studies failed to observe this association. Other studies indicated that lung cancer may have biological characteristics and mechanisms of carcinogenesis that are gender specific. Therefore, we hypothesized that women are more susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke exposure, as evidenced by a higher frequency of G:C-to-T:A somatic mutations in tumors from women in comparison with men at similar levels of tobacco smoke exposure. To investigate our hypothesis, we examined the TP53 mutational spectrum in a case-only (102 women and 201 men) series study where complete smoking information was available. A similar frequency and type of somatic TP53 mutations were observed in women and men. In conclusion, our study indicates that the TP53 mutation spectrum is similar in women and men. Our results are consistent with a recent large cohort study and summary of previous cohort studies, suggesting that women likely have equivalent susceptibility to lung cancer as men."

This inverse relationship between age and trial enrollment fraction was consistent across racial and ethnic groups. Although the total number of trial participants increased during our study period, the representation of racial and ethnic minorities decreased.

Data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. In addition, a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to adjust for potential confounding factors.In the period studied, lung resections were performed in 253 patients with NSCLC, of whom 114 had stage I tumors. Four patients were excluded because of death in the immediate postoperative period, and 1 committed suicide. The 5-year survival rate was 85.5% for women and 46.4% for men (P<0.0001). The median overall survival time was 44.7 months (interquartile range [IQR(25%-75%)], 17.4-72.3 months) and was longer in women than in men: 63.9 months (IQR(25%5%), 35.2-98.7 months) versus 32.3 months (IQR(25%-75%), 11.8-61.5 months), respectively (P<0.0001). Gender effect was still present after adjustment by Cox regression for several factors (age, smoking habits, hemoglobin, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, tumor size, tumor-node-metastasis stage, histology, postoperative complications, and surgery type). The adjusted hazard ratio in women was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.09-0.59; (P<0.0001) when compared with men.This study confirms previous findings that women live longer than men after surgery for stage I NSCLC. This effect persisted after adjusting for several factors. These results highlight the fact that analyses of long-term survival of NSCLC patients, usually generalized to men and women as a whole, may be an inadequate extrapolation. These results question whether analyses of long-term survival, which commonly group men and women together, provide an adequate prognosis of survival rates in women with NSCLC."

Hong Kong has a low female smoking prevalence rate and therefore the trend of the female incidence of lung cancer is particularly interesting because it can reflect the effects of the non-smoking related risk factors more clearly. The present study examined the trends of incidence rates for the major histologic types and smoking prevalence from 1983 to 2000 in Hong Kong with respect to gender. The prevalence of daily smokers decreased from 39.7% in 1982 to 22% in 2000 in males and from 5.6 to 3.5% in females. The time trends of the lung cancer incidence (overall or with respect to age and histology) were similar for both genders. The overall incidence decreased progressively throughout the study period, attributable to the decrease in squamous cell, small cell and large cell carcinoma. The decline occurred in all age groups but to a greater extent in the younger age groups. The incidence of adenocarcinoma increased until 1988-1990 and then stabilized. The initial increase was restricted to the older age groups. These temporal patterns suggested that the same etiological factors affected both genders to a different extent but manifested as similar changes in the direction of incidence over time. To confirm this hypothesis, further studies were needed to clarify the nature of these etiological factors for the non-smoking related lung cancer cases."

The present study examined the trends of incidence rates for the major histologic types and smoking prevalence from 1983 to 2000 in Hong Kong with respect to gender. The prevalence of daily smokers decreased from 39.7% in 1982 to 22% in 2000 in males and from 5.6 to 3.5% in females. The time trends of the lung cancer incidence (overall or with respect to age and histology) were similar for both genders. The overall incidence decreased progressively throughout the study period, attributable to the decrease in squamous cell, small cell and large cell carcinoma. The decline occurred in all age groups but to a greater extent in the younger age groups. The incidence of adenocarcinoma increased until 1988-1990 and then stabilized. The initial increase was restricted to the older age groups. These temporal patterns suggested that the same etiological factors affected both genders to a different extent but manifested as similar changes in the direction of incidence over time. To confirm this hypothesis, further studies were needed to clarify the nature of these etiological factors for the non-smoking related lung cancer cases."

Data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. In addition, a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to adjust for potential confounding factors.In the period studied, lung resections were performed in 253 patients with NSCLC, of whom 114 had stage I tumors. Four patients were excluded because of death in the immediate postoperative period, and 1 committed suicide. The 5-year survival rate was 85.5% for women and 46.4% for men (P<0.0001). The median overall survival time was 44.7 months (interquartile range [IQR(25%-75%)], 17.4-72.3 months) and was longer in women than in men: 63.9 months (IQR(25%5%), 35.2-98.7 months) versus 32.3 months (IQR(25%-75%), 11.8-61.5 months), respectively (P<0.0001). Gender effect was still present after adjustment by Cox regression for several factors (age, smoking habits, hemoglobin, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, tumor size, tumor-node-metastasis stage, histology, postoperative complications, and surgery type). The adjusted hazard ratio in women was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.09-0.59; (P<0.0001) when compared with men.This study confirms previous findings that women live longer than men after surgery for stage I NSCLC. This effect persisted after adjusting for several factors. These results highlight the fact that analyses of long-term survival of NSCLC patients, usually generalized to men and women as a whole, may be an inadequate extrapolation. These results question whether analyses of long-term survival, which commonly group men and women together, provide an adequate prognosis of survival rates in women with NSCLC."

In this study, 101 patients attending a rapid access clinic at Papworth Hospital with a diagnosis of lung cancer were asked to assess their own ECOG PS score on a scale between 0 and 4. Patients' scores were compared to the PS assessment of them made by their oncologists. Of 98 patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), weighted kappa statistics showed PS score agreement between patient and oncologist of 0.45. Both patient- and oncologist-assessed scores reflected survival duration (in NSCLC and SCLC) as well as disease stage (in NSCLC), with oncologist-assessed scores being only marginally more predictive of survival. There was no sex difference in patient assessment of PS scores, but oncologists scored female patients more pessimistically than males. This study showed that, with few exceptions, patients and oncologists assessed PS scores similarly. Although oncologists should continue to score PS objectively, it may benefit their clinical practice to involve their patients in these assessments."

The CYP3A4*1B allele has been associated with a two-fold higher promoter activity and with high-grade prostate cancers. The very frequent intron 3 polymorphism in the CYP3A5 gene (CYP3A5*3) results in decreased CYP3A5 protein levels. A case-control study was conducted in 801 Caucasian lung cancer patients that included 330 adenocarcinomas, 260 squamous cell carcinomas, 171 small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and 432 Caucasian hospital-based controls. CYP3A-genotyping was performed by capillary polymerase chain reaction followed by fluorescence-based melting curve analysis. A significantly increased SCLC risk for CYP3A4*1B allele carriers [odds ratio (OR) 2.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-4.55, P=0.02] was found. After dividing cases and controls by gender, an increased lung cancer risk for CYP3A4*1B carriers (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.94-9.90, P=0.06) for women but not for men (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56-1.81) was revealed.

For women, the respective OR was 8.00 (95% CI 2.12-30.30, P=0.005). Genotype frequencies were generally in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, except for CYP3A5 where a greater than expected number of CYP3A5*1 homozygotes was observed among cases (P=0.006).

Excess risks for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract and lung and colorectal adenocarcinoma were observed. Additionally, male hairdressers working in 1960 had an increased risk for urinary bladder cancer, which was highest in the 1960s with an SIR of 2.56 (95% CI 1.36-4.39) and decreased with the follow-up time.

The male-to-female (M:F) mortality rate ratio for ages 35-39 years decreased from 3.0 (95% CI = 2.7-3.4) around the 1915 birth cohort to 1.1 (95% CI = 1.0-1.1) around the 1960 birth cohort among whites and from 4.0 (95% CI = 3.2-5.0) around the 1925 birth cohort to 1.5 (95% CI = 1.3-1.7) around the 1960 birth cohort among blacks. Similarly, incidence rates for white men and women converged rapidly for adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, but less so for squamous cell carcinoma. These findings reflect the smoking patterns among white and black men and women: cigarette smoking prevalence at age 24 was essentially equal among white men and women born after 1960 but continued to be higher in black men than women. The convergence of lung cancer death rates among men and women born after 1960s supports the idea that males and females maybe equally susceptible to develop lung cancer from a given amount of cigarette smoking, rather than the hypothesis that women are more susceptible."

It might therefore be expected that such endogenously exposure to free radicals increases the individual cancer risk in patients with atherosclerotic diseases. We therefore studied the sex-specific risk of lung cancer and other cancers in atherosclerotic patients in a prospective study conducted in the Copenhagen area. The study cohort was linked to the Danish Hospital Discharge Register and we identified 2261 1-year survivors of atherosclerotic diseases through 1977 and 1993, while 26150 of the study subjects had no record of an atherosclerotic diagnosis. After linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry associations between atherosclerosis and cancer were analysed for each sex separately by means of Cox proportional hazard regression models. Atherosclerotic women had a significant RR of lung cancer of 3.26 (95% CI: 1.95-5.46) compared to non-atherosclerotic women after adjustment for age, calendar period, study population, smoking habits, school education and alcohol consumption. No significant risk of male lung cancer, RR=1.12 (95% CI: 0.77-1.64), or other smoking-related cancers in either sex was observed after multivariate adjustment. Atherosclerosis did not predict non-smoking-related cancers in general in either men, RR=0.91 (95% CI 0.69-1.20), or women, RR=0.93 (95% CI: 0.64-1.35). We hypothesize that oxidative stress due to episodes of ischemia/reperfusion increases the risk of lung cancer in atherosclerotic females because of a gender specific susceptibility to oxidative DNA damage."

By the early 1980s a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential had occurred in some countries, where it reached a maximum and thereafter followed a declining trend. Of particular interest to the present investigation is the anomalous experience of Japan, where unlike other high-income countries the female advantage in life expectancy has been expanding. We contrast the case of Japan with that of Sweden, where, like many other high-income nations, the sex differential in longevity has been narrowing in recent years. We observe that in Sweden, until the early 1980s, the sex gap in life expectancy (female-male) exceeded that of Japan; but this situation reversed in subsequent periods, when the Swedish differential narrowed and that of Japan widened. A decomposition analysis indicates that these divergent patterns since 1980 have resulted mainly from larger than expected reductions in male mortality in Sweden due to heart disease and from accidents and violence, lung cancer and ""other"" cancers. In Japan, death rates for men and women from heart disease--which is a leading cause of death--have tended to decline more or less at the same pace since the early 1980s; and with regard to lung cancer, and ""other"" neoplasms, male death rates in Japan have been rising while those of women have either declined or risen more slowly. Moreover, during the 1990s, male and female suicide rates rose in Japan, but the rates for men went up faster. Altogether, the net effect of these divergent mortality trends for men and women in Japan underlie much of the observed widening of its sex differential in longevity in recent years."

Over the last decade individual genetic variability of the estradiol metabolism has been described as a significant contributor to disease susceptibility with variations depending on ethnic background. Among others, genetic variations of genes encoding cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play an important role in this regard. Mutant alleles of the CYP 1A1 gene are major modulators of lung cancer risk among smokers, mediate gender differences in lung cancer susceptibility, and have been associated with an elevated risk for developing breast, prostate, colorectal, and oral squamous cell cancer. Variants of the CYP 1B1 gene modulate the risk for developing prostate, ovarian, lung, and breast cancer. Also, mutations in the CYP 1B1 gene are the major genetic determinant of congenital glaucoma. Mutant CYP 17 alleles are associated with serum and plasma levels of steroid hormones, use of hormone replacement therapy, and the development of endometrial, prostate, and breast cancer. Available data indicate that the protective effect against breast cancer of a later age at menarche is limited to wild-type CYP 17 allele carriers. Among women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, carriage of mutant CYP 17 alleles is sufficient to aggravate the clinical presentation of the disease. Molecular variants of the CYP 19 gene are associated with an increased risk for developing breast cancer, advanced breast cancer stages, and tumor aromatase production. Carriage of a mutant catechol-O-methyltransferase allele is associated with breast cancer, neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and modulates behavior among patients with schizophrenia, alcoholics and the general population. In summary, the available evidence points to genes that encode estrogen-metabolizing enzymes as strong hereditary determinants of the susceptibility to benign as well as malignant conditions."

The in vivo toxicity of 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide in BALB/c mice was dose-, route-, sex- and age-dependent. 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide was significantly less toxic to female than to male mice but the difference decreased with age. 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide and 9-aminocamptothecin produced similar inhibition (approximately 80%) of LS174T human colorectal carcinoma tumours. 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide cured a high percentage of CL1-5 human lung cancer xenografts with efficacy that was similar to or greater than 9-aminocamptothecin, irinotecan and topotecan. The potent anti-tumour activity of 9-aminocamptothecin glucuronide suggests that this prodrug should be further evaluated for cancer treatment."

Over the last decade individual genetic variability of the estradiol metabolism has been described as a significant contributor to disease susceptibility with variations depending on ethnic background. Among others, genetic variations of genes encoding cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play an important role in this regard. Mutant alleles of the CYP 1A1 gene are major modulators of lung cancer risk among smokers, mediate gender differences in lung cancer susceptibility, and have been associated with an elevated risk for developing breast, prostate, colorectal, and oral squamous cell cancer. Variants of the CYP 1B1 gene modulate the risk for developing prostate, ovarian, lung, and breast cancer. Also, mutations in the CYP 1B1 gene are the major genetic determinant of congenital glaucoma. Mutant CYP 17 alleles are associated with serum and plasma levels of steroid hormones, use of hormone replacement therapy, and the development of endometrial, prostate, and breast cancer. Available data indicate that the protective effect against breast cancer of a later age at menarche is limited to wild-type CYP 17 allele carriers. Among women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, carriage of mutant CYP 17 alleles is sufficient to aggravate the clinical presentation of the disease. Molecular variants of the CYP 19 gene are associated with an increased risk for developing breast cancer, advanced breast cancer stages, and tumor aromatase production. Carriage of a mutant catechol-O-methyltransferase allele is associated with breast cancer, neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and modulates behavior among patients with schizophrenia, alcoholics and the general population. In summary, the available evidence points to genes that encode estrogen-metabolizing enzymes as strong hereditary determinants of the susceptibility to benign as well as malignant conditions."

Random effects meta-analyses estimated the relative risk of lung cancer in filter and plain cigarette smokers (or with most and least filter use), in lower and higher tar smokers, in ever handrolled and manufactured only smokers, and in ever black tobacco and blond tobacco only smokers. From 43 gender-specific estimates, the risk was estimated to be 36% (95% confidence interval 27% to 44%) lower in filter than in plain cigarette smokers. The reduction was evident in both genders and in different continents. It was greater, 50% (33% to 63%, n = 11 estimates), for squamous-cell carcinoma but was also evident, 20% (-6% to 39%, n = 8), for adenocarcinoma. The risk was 23% (12% to 32%, n = 22) lower for lower tar than higher tar smokers. This reduction, seen in both genders, equates to a 2% to 3% risk reduction per milligram tar per cigarette. The risk was increased by 42% (21% to 66%, n = 15) for handrolled cigarette smoking and 75% (47% to 109%, n = 12) for black tobacco cigarette smoking. These estimates did not depend critically on results from specific studies or the limited confounding adjustment in some studies. Various problems with the epidemiological evidence are discussed, including the difficulty of obtaining compatible exposure indices from each study, the inadequate reporting of data from the largest studies, the likelihood of misreporting of cigarette type, and the inadequate control for nonsmoking confounding variables. Difficulties also arise in adjusting appropriately for aspects of smoking behavior that not only may differ between those choosing to switch or not to switch to lower tar but also may change as a result of switching. The overall data clearly show, however, that lung cancer risk is affected by the type of cigarette smoked. The suggestion that the switch to low tar cigarettes has led to an increase in the smoker/nonsmoker lung cancer relative risk and in the relative frequency of adenocarcinoma versus squamous carcinoma is shown to be weakly based. Although more data are needed relating to modern very-low-tar cigarettes, the evidence is consistent with tar reduction and the switch to filter cigarettes having reduced lung cancer risk. Indeed, the meta-analysis estimates may seriously understate the risk reductions associated with lifetime smoking of low-tar filter cigarettes."

A sex- and age-matched case-control study was designed to investigate such a relationship.Cases consisted of 236 male and 291 female incident cases with newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed primary carcinoma of the lung, and were compared to one or two individually matched controls.Cigarette smoking, occupations, and previous tuberculosis history were found to independently correlate with an elevated risk of squamous/small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma for male patients. However, there was little difference in the effect of these risk factors except smoking. The use of fume extractors in the kitchen, and the habit of waiting to fry after the fumes were emitted, separately explained the majority of the attributable fraction of female squamous/small cell carcinoma (28.2%) and adenocarcinoma (47.7%). With the exception of a kitchen with fume extractors and a clinical history of tuberculosis, the environmental causal factors of lung cancer were heterogeneous between these two histologic cell groups.Our results suggested that the causal factors of lung cancer might be specific for the type of tumor concerned. The gender-specific risk factors of lung cancer could partly explain the difference in cell-type distribution between men and women."

A total of 45,297 lung cancer cases were analysed. The overall age-adjusted incidence rates of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in men peaked in the 1980s and then slightly decreased, while corresponding rates in women increased steadily. The incidence of adenocarcinoma increased in both genders. The male-to-female incidence ratio for SCC was 12.4 in the 1960s and 3.6 in the 1990s. For adenocarcinoma the ratio was close to 1.5 throughout the period. Regression analysis indicated that the birth cohort of the 1940s was at the highest risk for adenocarcinoma in men and for all types of lung cancer in women. Lung cancer in parents was a risk factor for offspring. In conclusion, the data, particularly on women, suggest that modern cigarettes induce lung adenocarcinoma and SCC in a proportion of 1:0.6. This proportion was 1:3.7 among men diagnosed in the 1960s. The incidence ratio of 1.3 for adenocarcinoma between men and women in the 1990s is consistent with the smoking prevalence data a few decades ago, suggesting equal sensitivity of both genders to tobacco-induced lung cancer."

The primary aim of the present study was to estimate the effects of birth cohort, year of diagnosis (period), and age on the time trends of lung cancer incidence rates, and to analyze the gender-specific incidence of different histopathological types of lung cancer.Among men the age-standardized incidence rate increased steadily up to 1982, when a peak of 49 cases per 100,000 person-years was reached. Among women the incidence rate was lower and showed a monotonic increase throughout the observation period. The fastest rate of increase was noted among the youngest women. In women, but not in men, there was a steady increase in risk with each successive birth cohort. For both sexes there were large changes in the histopathological distributions of cases. The most notable was a major increase in adenocarcinomas.The overall age-adjusted incidence rate of lung cancer in Sweden has stabilized in men during the past two decades while rates are still increasing in women. In view of the continued high prevalence of smoking among young women, a future definite increase in the overall number of lung cancer cases in women can be expected."

For men, the highest percentages of excess mortality (between 40% and 60%) were found for smoking and alcohol related causes of death such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and cirrhosis while for women the highest percentages of excess mortality (between 40% and 60%) were found for diet related causes such as diabetes and ischaemic heart disease.Health inequality is a widespread phenomenon in the majority of the top leading causes of deaths of the nation. Increasing levels of deprivation indices are associated with mortality risk differently by both cause and gender. Results suggest that deprivation effects mainly captured by Index 2 may manifest largely as unfavourable health behaviours leading to gender specific sets of causes of deaths. Findings of this study are consistent with the idea that material deprivation determines health inequality through both an increase of general susceptibility to ill health, leading to excess mortality in a wide range of causes, and a set of specific factors, resulting in an increased risk of death from a specific set of causes in each gender."

Cigarette smoking cannot explain the high lung cancer mortality in this population because less than 10% of women in Taiwan are smokers. Therefore, environmental factors other than smoking may play an important role in lung cancer development in female nonsmokers. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of environmental carcinogen exposure in lung cancer development in Taiwanese female nonsmokers, based on DNA adduct formation. We collected nontumorous lung tissues resected from 62 nonsmoking lung cancer patients and 20 noncancer controls to investigate whether differences in susceptibility to DNA adduct formation exist between men and women. (32)P-postlabeling and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with polyclonal antibody against BPDE (7,8-dihydroxy-anti-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene)-DNA adduct were used to evaluate DNA adduct levels in lung tissues of study subjects. Our data showed that the DNA adduct levels of lung cancer patients determined by both assays were significantly higher than those of noncancer controls (P = 0.0001 for (32)P-postlabeling; P = 0.01 for ELISA). Moreover, DNA adduct levels in females were markedly greater than those in males (P = 0.014 for (32)P-postlabeling; P = 0.001 for ELISA). The difference in DNA adduct levels could not be explained by genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P-4501A1 (CYP1A1) or glutathione S-transferase (GSTM1), as determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. These results demonstrate that lung cancer patients have a higher susceptibility to DNA damage than that of noncancer controls.

Cancer is a result of multiple gene-environment interactions occurring over several decades. During tumor development the cell accumulates multiple genetic changes, which generate the transformed phenotype, i.e. a cell with increased genetic instability. Lung cancer is a useful model for the study of the interplay between genetic factors and environmental exposure since the primary etiology is well established. Several polymorphic enzymes that may be important determinants of susceptibility have been demonstrated. Data also provide evidence for sex differences in lung cancer susceptibility. Furthermore, certain chemical carcinogens may contribute to the carcinogenic process in the lung epithelial cells by inducing genomic instability either directly or indirectly through inflammatory processes."

The areas selected were located in three different regions (i.e., Piedmont, Tuscany, and Emilia-Romagna). The following cancer sites were selected for the study: stomach, colon, rectum, lung, skin melanoma, skin non-melanoma, breast, cervix and corpus uteri, ovary, bladder, kidney. Cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were also included. Altogether, 1,044 newly diagnosed cases aged 20-75 years were ascertained from hospital records from March 1990 to September 1992, and for 945 of them detailed information was collected by a standard questionnaire. The analyses of data were performed comparing each case series to a reference group drawn from among the other sites. Unconditional logistic regression models were used in the statistical analyses.Statistically significant increased risks in association with farming were estimated for skin melanoma (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-5.8) and bladder cancer (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.1). Lung cancer was also found increased but not at a statistically significant level (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.7-4.4). An OR lower than unity was observed for postmenopausal breast cancer (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.7).The present study suggests that women in farming might experience increased risk of cancers, not usually found in excess among male farmers, as well as a protective effect for postmenopausal breast cancer.

Utilization of estrogen receptor assays in breast carcinoma is well established, but the role of such evaluation in other cancers largely is unknown. In this study, immunohistochemical expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and the ER-related protein p29 was correlated with survival of patients with nonsmall cell carcinoma of the lung.All patients with a tissue diagnosis of primary nonsmall cell bronchogenic carcinoma diagnosed over a 6-year period at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont were reviewed. Assays for p29 and ER using a streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method were performed on each tumor. Results were correlated with clinical data, including survival.Of 111 tumors examined, 109 (98%) were positive for p29 whereas none of the tumors reacted with ER (ER1D5). The relation between p29 expression and survival time was different for men and women. A statistically significant negative relation for women was observed; this relation was most pronounced in patients with Stage I and II tumors. A positive but not statistically significant relation was observed for men.The ER-related protein p29 commonly is expressed in nonsmall cell carcinomas of the lung. The relation between p29 and survival time is different for males and females, suggesting the presence of gender specific factors that may influence tumor growth and overall patient survival, especially in patients with early stage lung carcinoma."

Mortality data, census data, a postal survey of living circumstances, historic and contemporary data on air quality and a historic land-use survey were used. Analysis was based on two conurbations in England, Teesside and Sunderland. Housing estates in Teesside were selected based on socioeconomic criteria and distinguished by proximity to steel and chemical industries; they were grouped into three zones: near (A), intermediate (B), and farther (C), with a single zone in Sunderland. We included 14,962 deaths in 27 estates. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for lung cancer [International Classification of Diseases #9 (ICD-9) 162] and cancers other than lung (ICD-9 140-239, excluding 162), and sex ratios were calculated. Mortality from lung cancer was well above national levels in all zones. For men, a weak gradient corresponding with proximity to industry at younger ages reversed at older ages. In women 0-64 years of age, stronger gradients in lung cancer mortality corresponded with proximity to industry across zones A, B, and C (SMR = 393, 251, 242, respectively). Overall rates in Teesside were higher than Sunderland rates for women aged 0-64 years (SMR = 287 vs. 185) and 65-74 years (SMR = 190 vs. 157). The association between raised lung cancer mortality and proximity to industry in women under 75 years of age could not be explained by smoking, occupation, socioeconomic factors, or artifact. Explanations for differences between men and women may include gender-specific occupational experiences and smoking patterns. Our judgment is that the observed gradient in women points to a role for industrial air pollution."

Detailed information on lifetime residential, occupational, and smoking history was obtained by structured telephone interviews with knowledgeable informants. Interviews were completed for 82% of 183 eligible cases and 88% of the targeted number (366) of controls. Estimated historical environmental exposures to smelter emissions, based on atmospheric diffusion modeling of measured SO2 concentrations, were linked with residential histories to derive individual profiles of residential exposure. Occupational histories were characterized by potential exposure to smelter emissions, asbestos, and ionizing radiation. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare study factors in cases and controls with adjustment for potential confounding factors: gender, Hispanic ethnicity, and smoking. In overall and gender-specific analyses, no statistically significant associations were observed between lung cancer risk and any of the measures of residential exposure to smelter emissions considered (town of residence at time of death, highest level of exposure, and duration or cumulative exposure above background levels), or any of the estimated occupational exposures (definite or potential asbestos, potential ionizing radiation, definite or potential smelter). Among male residents of some, but not all, towns, there was some evidence of a positive association between lung cancer risk and reported copper smelter-related employment (reported as definite), with the highest risk observed for Miami, Arizona.

9152470,No," G Gatta,",Variations in the survival of adult cancer patients in Italy.,Tumori,1997 Jan-Feb,Epidemiology,Human,90431,"As part of the ITACARE project, the present study analyzed and compared population-based data on the survival of adult cancer patients in Italy, according to sex, age, period of diagnosis and geographical area.Nine Italian population-based cancer registries provided data on all their cancer patients (total 90,431 cases) followed for at least 5 years and diagnosed during the period 1978-1989. About 10% of the Italian population is covered by these registries. The data was analyzed by means of a multivariate model.The major findings were that there was a general improvement in 5-year relative survival over the study period (from 33% to 39%) and that there were significant differences in survival between different areas of the country, particularly for cancer sites which respond well to treatment. In general, the area covered by the Ragusa (Sicily) registry was characterized by significantly worse survival than other registry populations. Other important findings were that for all malignant cancer sites 5-year relative survival decreased with age from 50% for the youngest age class (15-44 years) to 27% for the oldest age class (75+ years) and that women have a better prognosis for most cancer sites (overall 5-year relative survival in women 48% vs 32% in men).The significant regional differences in survival may reflect unequal provision of care, particularly between northern-central Italy and the south. The reasons for the general survival improvement with time are not completely understood, whereas the marked overall sex difference is related to the fact that the commonest cancer in women (breast cancer) is eminently more treatable than the commonest malignancy in men (lung cancer). The unfavorable trend with increasing age may be due to increasing difficulty in applying complete therapy protocols as general health declines, sometimes in relation to an advanced cancer stage at diagnosis."

Analysis of covariance procedures were utilised to test for differences in levels of physical functioning and physical role limitations according to cancer site and treatment modality, adjusting for differences in age, comorbid conditions and retrospective physical functioning. Physical functioning and physical role limitations were measured using two subscales of the Medical Outcomes Studies MOS 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Physical functioning prior to diagnosis, and to a lesser degree comorbidity, contributed significantly to current levels of physical functioning and physical role limitations. Patients with lung cancer reported lower physical functioning and physical role limitation scores than patients with prostate cancer, and patients treated with surgery only reported lower physical functioning and physical role limitation scores than patients treated with neither surgery nor radiation. No gender differences were observed among the reduced sample consisting of patients with colon or lung cancer. It is important not only that physicians and oncologists are cognizant of the fact that some cancers (particularly lung cancer) may be more physically debilitating than others, but that the patient's history of comorbid conditions and pre-existing physical limitations may be important factors in predicting current physical functioning."

We examined the relationship between diet and lung cancer development in 137 lung cancer cases (93 African Americans and 44 Mexican Americans) and 187 controls (78 African Americans and 109 Mexican Americans). Cases reported a higher daily mean total fat intake (p < 0.001), whereas controls had a higher daily mean intake of dietary fiber (p < 0.001) and fruits (p = 0.02). Ethnic differences in diet were also observed: Mexican Americans consumed less total fat (p < 0.02) and more fiber (p < 0.001) and vegetables (p = 0.08) than African Americans. Additionally, men consumed more total fat (p = 0.08) and less fiber (p = 0.001), fruits (p < 0.001), and vegetables (p = 0.002) than women. Multivariable analysis, after adjustment for the effects of pack-years of smoking, age, total energy intake, sex, and ethnicity, demonstrated a positive association between high total fat consumption and lung cancer risk (p < 0.01) and an inverse association between high fruit consumption and lung cancer risk (p = 0.05). In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that diet, particularly high fat consumption and low fruit and vegetable consumption, contributes (independent of cigarette smoking) to the excess lung cancer risk in African-American men, who have the highest lung cancer rates in the United States."

However, tobacco consumption dropped by 35% in Canada during the 1980s.Using data collected during a Quebec health survey, we evaluated the prevalences of tobacco use by birth cohort. Since mortality has been decreasing for both sexes, we computed gender-specific cohort mortality indices for tobacco-related causes of death. In the analysis, we took into account the inevitable time lag between adopting the behavior and becoming the victim of a smoking-attributable disease.Results indicate a systematic decrease in tobacco use from older male cohorts to younger ones across all ages; however, for females an increase in tobacco use has been observed from one cohort to the next but there seems to be hope for a future trend toward breaking the habit. While a decline in tobacco-related mortality has been observed among men (e.g., death from ischemic heart disease), female lung cancer mortality increased considerably. Finally, we present an indicator measuring the years of potential life lost for some tobacco-related causes of death.The cohort approach allows us to observe birth-cohort-specific trends, thereby more easily relating past behavior to current mortality levels. In terms of prevention, increasing female mortality from lung cancer should become a major concern and a motivator in the fight against tobacco use."

Study parameters were age, race, tobacco and alcohol history, gender, weight-loss pattern, histology, TNM stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and therapy. Influences of study variables on Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were subsequently determined using univariate and multivariate analyses.Overall median survival after diagnosis was significantly shorter for men with NSCLC than for women with the disease (40 vs. 78 weeks, P = 0.001). Men lost significantly more weight over their disease course than women (12.2 vs. 5.4 pounds, P = 0.006) and experienced an eightfold faster rate of initial weight loss (0.25 vs. 0.03 pounds per week, P = 0.001).

Comparison with clinicopathologic parameters demonstrated that the p53 protein was detected more frequently in younger patients (younger than 50 years, p = 0.014), whereas no correlation was found with sex, tumor differentiation, tumor histologic type, or TNM stage. Surprisingly, follow-up analysis revealed that p53 staining was associated with an increased rate of disease-free survival, especially in patients with early stage tumor disease (p = 0.004) and in male patients (p = 0.023). Counter to previous studies in other solid tumors, immunocytochemical detection of p53 expression does not predict a poor clinical outcome in non-small-cell lung cancer. In early-stage lung cancer it might be associated with an improved disease-free survival, which suggests that the majority of the detected protein inherits the wild-type tumor suppressor function."

Poisson's log-linear regression model revealed that the mortality in both sexes depended significantly on three time factors: age, year of birth and historical period. The dependence of mortality on the above factors was analyzed by Osmond-Gardner's method. The mortality increased in both sexes with age. The risk of death in male generations born between the beginning of the 19th century and the First World War declined, however, in generations born after 1915 it increased again with consecutive years of birth. In women the risk of death increased with the year of birth. The impact of five-year periods on mortality increased slowly, however, in women only from the first half of the seventies."

Major differences were observed for all common cancer sites, including stomach (49/100,000 males in Costa Rica, 38 in the USSR and Japan vs 5/100,000 in the United States), intestines (over 25/100,000 males in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and New Zealand vs 10-15/100,000 in Japan and Southern Europe and less than 5/100,000 in most Latin American and Asian countries), lung (over 70/100,000 in Belgium, Scotland, The Netherlands, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and less than 20/100,000 in most Latin American and Asian countries; over 20/100,000 females in Britain, Hong Kong, the United States and Denmark vs less than 5/100,000 in France, Spain and again most areas of Asia and Africa providing data; breast (over 25/100,000 females in Great Britain, New Zealand, Belgium, The Netherlands and Uruguay, vs less than 10/100,000 in Japan, Hong Kong and most Latin American countries). Thus, there was over a fivefold variation in total cancer mortality for both sexes, the highest rates being in Hungary (237/100,000) and Czechoslovakia (229/100,000) for males, and in Denmark (142/100,000) and Scotland (138/100,000) for females. Although problems of validity and reliability of cancer death certification, mostly in developing countries, may in part explain this variation, these substantial differences are at least in part real and essentially reflect, besides the impact of breast cancer in females and of stomach and colorectal cancer in both sexes, the different spectrum of the tobacco-related lung cancer epidemic in the two sexes and in various areas of the world."

For underdeveloped countries, little information is available, but analogue proportions can be supposed. In the nations of the industrialized world males have a significantly higher mortality rate, which shortens their life expectancy in comparison with that of woman. Since about 1970 a deceleration of this development has been observed. The diseases responsible for this fact are ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, accidents, and other traumatic incidences, but also infectious diseases. Concerning the origins of ischemic heart disease, the influence of sex hormones especially on the lipid profile are being discussed; nevertheless, for the enhanced coronary risk of males environmental and behavioral factors seem to be more important than biological reasons. As for carcinosis being a reason for the mortality of males, lung cancer is in the foremost position. Cigarette consumption, as well as the higher exposure to cancerogenic substances related to typically male professions, are held responsible for this. As for other types of cancer, environmental factors depending on gender are strongly considered as a reason for different rates of mortality. Furthermore, sociological explanations for these differing frequencies are being discussed. Occupational differences and the different positions held in working life by each gender are believed to be responsible for the higher rate of mortality among males. Also, risktaking behavior seems to be found more often among males, than among females. A variety of hypotheses based on genetics have been given to explain the different gender-specific rates of mortality, but none of them has yet been proven correct.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

(A sex mortality ratio is the ratio of male to female death rates.) Previous analyses have shown that during the mid-twentieth century sex mortality ratios increased for all adult age groups. During the 1980s sex mortality ratios continued to increase for 25-34 year olds, but showed mixed trends for other adult age groups. For example, for older adults aged 55-64, sex mortality ratios increased in Southern and Eastern European countries and Japan, but sex mortality ratios decreased in Northern European and Anglophone countries. Trends in several causes of death contributed to these trends in sex mortality ratios. For example, for 25-34 year olds, increases in men's suicide rates and HIV or AIDS mortality contributed to the increases in sex mortality ratios. For older adults, it was hypothesized that decreasing sex differences in cigarette smoking in recent decades would result in decreasing sex differences in lung cancer and ischemic heart disease mortality during the 1980s. The predicted decrease in sex differences in lung cancer mortality was observed in many countries; women had more unfavorable lung cancer mortality trends than men in the Anglophone countries and Northern and Central Western European countries. In contrast, very little evidence was found for the predicted decrease in sex differences in ischemic heart disease. The paper presents additional data concerning the contributions of trends in specific causes of death to changes in sex mortality ratios and briefly reviews evidence concerning probable causes of the observed mortality trends. It appears that recent trends in sex mortality ratios have been influenced by changing sex differences in smoking and a variety of additional factors, such as the effects of improvements in health care interacting with inherent sex differences in vulnerability to ischemic heart disease."

Male nicotine-dependent smokers were consistently found in greater numbers among blue collar workers throughout the study period. Initially, female nicotine-dependent smokers were more often found among blue collar workers, but in recent years became more frequent among white collar workers.These trends provide clues to the future epidemiological distribution of lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases.

2258274,Yes," E T Fontham,",Protective dietary factors and lung cancer.,International journal of epidemiology,1990,Review,Human,n.a.,"Since the first report of a protective effect of dietary vitamin A on lung cancer risk was issued in 1975, a succession of retrospective (case-control) and prospective (cohort) epidemiological studies have examined the association. Food frequency questionnaires have been used to assess dietary intake of food groups and to generate indices of specific dietary components, in particular retinol and carotene. Serum levels of retinol, carotenoids, and other micronutrients have been determined as well, and related to risk of lung cancer. The dietary studies have been notably consistent, finding an approximate 50% reduction in risk associated with high compared to low consumption of carotene-containing fruits and vegetables. Unresolved issues include gender differences, histological specificity and the interaction with cigarette smoking as well as the role of other possible protective factors found in these foods--indoles, vitamin C, trace minerals. Most studies in which serum beta-carotene was assayed in prospectively collected blood samples have found lower levels of beta-carotene in people who subsequently developed lung cancer. Unlike carotene, blood retinol levels do not reflect dietary intake under normal conditions and, as might be expected, have failed to show a consistent relation with risk of lung cancer. Although epidemiological studies have not strongly supported the role of preformed retinol as a protective agent, animal studies have provided convincing evidence that retinol and synthetic retinoids are protective against epithelial tumours including those of the lung. A number of on-going clinical trials are testing the efficacy of retinol, beta-carotene, synthetic retinoids and alpha-tocopherol for preventing cancer of the lung, especially in high risk groups such as heavy smokers, miners and asbestos workers. It is hoped that these trials will help explain the nature of the observed protective effect of fruit and vegetables."

As in other industrialized countries, men in the FRG, compared to women, have higher mortality rates in all leading causes of death. The sex differences are most prominent in coronary heart disease, lung cancer, fatal accidents, suicide and liver cirrhosis. For example, in the age groups 35 to 55 the male/female ratio in the mortality rates was 6 to 7 for coronary heart disease, 3 to 4 for lung cancer, and 4 for fatal accidents. The cause-specific death rates and the results from corresponding epidemiological studies indicate that genetic disadvantages of men are reinforced by factors of the social environment and 'deleterious' individual behavior. Thus a great part of the sex differences in total mortality could be influenced and should not be judged as inevitable."

Male smokers (44%) had started smoking earlier (age 18) than female (14%, age 30), consumed more tobacco and more often inhaled tobacco smoke. Peptic ulcer, chronic bronchitis and lung cancer were examples of diseases more common in males. ECG evidences of myocardial ischemia were more common in males, while anginal pain showed the same prevalence. Cholecystectomy and antihypertensive treatment were more common among females. When adjustments were made for duration of smoking, amount of tobacco consumed, significant sex differences were still observed for ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia (dominance in males), peptic ulcer (dominance in males), intermittent claudication (dominance in females) and treatment for hypertension (dominance in females). The majority of disorders predominant in males were found to be related to smoking, while those predominating among females showed the same sex difference when adjustments were made for smoking habits. Future increasing segments of females addicted to tobacco smoking will obviously markedly influence sex difference in morbidity."
3083471,Yes, I Waldron,The contribution of smoking to sex differences in mortality.,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",1986 Mar-Apr,Review,Human,na,"The contribution of smoking to sex differences in mortality is estimated on the basis of data from 12 studies of the mortality of nonsmoking men and women, together with mortality data for comparable general population samples. Most of the data are for samples drawn from the U.S. population from the late 1950s to 1980. The findings from different studies are generally consistent, once methodological factors are taken into account. The findings indicate that, for total mortality, the proportion of sex differences attributable to smoking decreases from about two-thirds at age 40 to about one-quarter at age 80. Over the adult age span, it appears that about half of the sex difference in total mortality is attributable to smoking. Findings for ischemic heart disease mortality show a similar pattern. For lung cancer, it appears that about 90 percent of the sex difference in mortality is attributable to smoking. The estimated contributions of smoking include both the effects of sex differences in smoking habits and the effects of sex differences in the increase in mortality caused by smoking. The quantitative results should be interpreted with caution, since several lines of argument suggest that multivariate analyses controlling for other relevant factors would produce lower estimates of the contribution of smoking to sex differences in mortality. Despite this limitation, the findings analyzed in this review, together with additional evidence from related research, strongly support the conclusion that cigarette smoking makes a major contribution to men's higher mortality, but other factors also play an important role."

Similar relationships prevail in most developed nations. The sex differential in mortality has been increasing since the early 1900s , especially for those 15-24 and 55-64 years of age. Since 1970, however, that trend has slowed for persons 45-74, and in 1980 the sex differential was actually lower than in 1970 among those 55-64. Although the female sex advantage in respect to most causes of death has been increasing, the differential for coronary heart disease has recently stabilized; and the lung cancer mortality rate among women is now increasing faster than that among men. Recent statistics for these two important causes of death may indicate that the previous, more favorable trend in women than in men may be reversing in response to changes in lifestyle. Women's health may be improving at a slower rate because they are exposed to more job stresses and other risk factors, such as cigarettes, than before; alternatively, men's health may be improving at a faster rate because they are exercising more, smoking cigarettes less, and following healthier diets in recent decades. Despite their continuing mortality advantage, women experience more illness than men. This may reflect women's greater utilization of medical services, and physicians' diagnostic patterns, as well as women's greater willingness to acknowledge and report illness. Sex differences in illness persist, however, when physical examinations are used for assessment in population-based samples. Women appear to have higher rates of conditions that rarely cause death, for example, rheumatoid arthritis; whereas men tend to have more fatal conditions, such as coronary heart disease. At least two categories of lifestyle characteristics are associated with male-female differences in health: (a) social roles, such as marriage, parenthood, and employment; and (b) behaviors, such as cigarette smoking and Type A behavior. Preliminary evidence indicates that some of these lifestyle characteristics may act synergistically on health. Several aspects of lifestyle thus underlie sex differences in morbidity and mortality. There is also evidence that biological factors influence male/female mortality differences, particularly in infancy and prenatal life. A substantial sex differential remains, however, even after adjusting for numerous lifestyle and biological variables.

Male overmortality is highest in Finland and the USSR, followed closely by France, Poland, the USA and Canada. The differential is lowest in Japan, Ireland and in south-eastern Europe. The sex mortality ratio is highest at ages 15-24 years with a second peak generally occurring around age 60. The excess mortality of males at the younger ages is due largely to motor vehicle accidents while higher death rates from heart disease and lung cancer in particular account for a substantial proportion of male excess mortality during the later years of working life. During the course of the 20th century, the impact of sex differences in mortality from the infectious and parasitic diseases has declined, as has the contribution from maternal mortality. Males have also benefited from a decline in industrial accidents but this has been more than countered by rising death rates from heart diseases, lung cancer and motor vehicle accidents."
