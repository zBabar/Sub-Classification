The baseline characteristics of women who prematurely terminated CR participation were also explored.Baseline physiological and psychosocial indices of women ≤ 55 years compared with older women eligible for CR were evaluated 1 week before enrolling in either a traditional CR or a gender-specific, motivationally enhanced CR.A greater proportion of young women (n = 65) compared with their older counterparts (n = 187) were diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction during their index hospitalization. They demonstrated lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, higher total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios, and greater body weight compared with older women and were more likely to be active smokers. Young women compared with older women reported significantly worse health perceptions, quality of life, optimism, hope, social support, and stress and significantly more symptoms of depression and anxiety. Women who prematurely terminated CR participation were younger, more obese, with worse quality of life, and greater symptoms of depression and anxiety compared with women completing CR.Notable differences in physiological and psychosocial profiles of young women compared with older women enrolled in CR were evident, placing them at high risk for nonadherence to secondary prevention interventions as well as increased risk for disease progression and subsequent cardiac adverse events. Continued existence of these health differentials represents an important public health problem and warrants further research to address these age-related and sex-specific health disparities among women with coronary heart disease."

Compared with men, women were older, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to present in Killip Class III/IV and experience post-infarction angina or HF. After adjusting for baseline differences, both short-term and longer-term mortality were similar in men and women. However, women were more likely than men to experience the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, MI, HF, stroke, and resuscitation from cardiac arrest [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI); 1.06-1.24, P=0.001], mainly owing to an increased risk of hospitalization for HF (adjusted HR 1.36; 95% CI 1.22-1.52; P<0.001). In a subset of patients who underwent echocardiographic study (n=603), women had smaller left ventricular volumes indexed by body size than men but similar ejection fractions and similar changes in ventricular volumes from baseline to 1 month and 20 months.In VALIANT, the risk of HF following MI was higher in women than men after adjusting for age and comorbidities, although the risk of other fatal and non-fatal outcomes were similar. The higher long-term risk of HF in women appears to be independent of the extent of left ventricular systolic dysfunction or remodelling compared with men."

Many studies on CVD have included mostly men, and the knowledge about coronary artery disease (CAD) in women has largely been extrapolated from studies primarily focused on men. The influence of various risk factors is different between men and women; untoward effects of smoking of CAD are greater in women than men. Furthermore, the effect of the menopause is important in women, with higher incidence of plaque erosion in young women versus greater incidence of plaque rupture in older women.

We evaluated left ventricle remodeling in female and male rats post-MI.Rats were submitted to anterior descending coronary occlusion. Echocardiographic evaluations were performed on the first and sixth week post-occlusion to determine myocardial infarction size and left ventricle systolic function (FAC, fractional area change). Pulsed Doppler was applied to analyze left ventricle diastolic function using the following parameters: E wave, A wave, E/A ratio. Two-way ANOVA was applied for comparisons, complemented by the Bonferroni test.

Previous studies regarding gender-specific differences in CS are conflicting and there are insufficient data for the presence of gender-associated differences in the contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention era. Aim of this study was therefore to investigate gender-specific differences in a large cohort of AMI patients with CS undergoing contemporary treatment.In the randomized Intra-aortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock II (IABP-SHOCK II) trial, 600 patients with CS complicating AMI undergoing early revascularization were assigned to therapy with or without intra-aortic balloon pump. We compared sex-specific differences in these patients with regard to baseline and procedural characteristics as well as short- and long-term clinical outcome.Of 600 patients 187 (31%) were female. Women were significantly older than men and had a significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure at presentation (p < 0.05 for all). Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were more frequent in women, whereas smoking was more frequent in men (p < 0.05 for all). Women showed a higher mortality within the first day after randomization (p = 0.004). However, after multivariable adjustment this numerical difference was no longer statistically significant. No gender-related differences in clinical outcome were observed after 1, 6 and 12 months of follow-up.In this large-scale multicenter study in patients with CS complicating AMI, women had a worse-risk profile in comparison to men. No significant gender-related differences in treatment as well as short- and long-term outcome were observed."

At 30 days, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as death, reinfarction, new-onset severe heart failure, or rehospitalization for heart failure, were more common in women (11.1% vs 5.4%, hazard ratio 2.09, 95% CI 1.03-4.27, P = .04). After multivariable adjustment, age, but not sex or time to reperfusion, was an independent predictor of MACE.In the INFUSE-AMI randomized trial, women with anterior STEMI experienced a higher rate of MACE, attributable to older age. Despite longer delay from symptom onset to reperfusion therapy, there was no difference between women and men in infarct size or reperfusion success."

The average score of the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale at baseline was 23.4 for men and 27.0 for women (P<0.001). Higher stress in women was explained largely by sex differences in comorbidities, physical and mental health status, intrafamily conflict, caregiving demands, and financial hardship. After adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics, women had worse recovery than men at 1 month after acute myocardial infarction, with mean differences in improvement score between women and men ranging from -0.04 for EuroQol utility index to -3.96 for angina-related quality of life (P<0.05 for all). Further adjustment for baseline stress reduced these sex-based differences in recovery to -0.03 to -3.63, which, however, remained statistically significant (P<0.05 for all). High stress at baseline was associated with significantly worse recovery in angina-specific and overall quality of life, as well as mental health status. The effect of baseline stress on recovery did not vary between men and women.Among young and middle-aged patients, higher stress at baseline is associated with worse recovery in multiple health outcomes after acute myocardial infarction. Women perceive greater psychological stress than men at baseline, which partially explains women's worse recovery."

The purpose of this literature review is exploring in depth the experience of AMI in women.We selected and analyzed 44 articles on five factors strongly affecting women's well-being after AMI: the delay in seeking treatment for symptoms, medical treatment, therapeutic adherence, social support and coping strategies.The studies have attributed gender differences in the delay in seeking care for symptoms partly to a lack of information, but especially to socially built factors, such as the stereotypic belief of cardiac diseases as ""male diseases"". Studies on the medical treatment show that women are less likely to undergo diagnostic tests and clinical treatment compared to men, but women's older age may counterbalance the gender effect. Compared to men, therapeutic adherence appears lower in women, who find lifestyle changes more difficult to achieve; however, women rely more on social support, affecting positively their well-being. Also, women use more emotion-focused, evasive or fatalistic coping strategies; they are likely to minimize the severity of symptoms, to try to control the disease and to protect the significant others from the negative consequences of the infarction.Most studies highlight gender differences in the experience of AMI and in the patterns of influence of the factors we analyzed."

However, studies investigating the distribution and prognostic implications of high-sensitivity troponin levels in men and women separately are currently lacking.Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels were determined using a high-sensitivity assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) in 1,677 male and 1,073 female NSTE-ACS patients participating in the GUSTO IV study. The prognostic associations of cTnI to outcome (30-day composite end point of recurrent myocardial infarction and 1-year mortality) were assessed in multivariable models, using cTnI both as a continuous variable and dichotomized at different sets of single and gender-specific 99th percentiles.Median cTnI levels were 947 and 175 ng/L in men and women, respectively (P < .001). The adjusted odds ratios for cTnI (ln) were similar in men and women. The adjusted odds ratios for cTnI above the tested 99th percentiles levels in contrast were twice as high in women compared with men. This was a consequence of differences in the cTnI distribution and risk gradients across cTnI levels, in particular due to lower event rates in women without cTnI elevation. Gender-specific cutoffs did not improve risk prediction.Despite overall lower levels, cTnI above the tested 99th percentiles exhibited stronger prognostic information in women with NSTE-ACS compared with men. This likely reflects differences in the pathophysiology and the clinical presentation in NSTE-ACS. Our data, thus, emphasize that women with symptoms of unstable coronary artery disease encompass a broader risk panorama than men."

At the molecular level, circadian clocks in distinct cells, including cardiomyocytes, generate 24-h cycles of biochemical processes. Possible imbalance or impairment in the cell clock mechanism may alter the cardiac metabolism and function and increase the susceptibility of cardiovascular diseases. One of the key components of the human clock system PERIOD3 (PER3) has been recently demonstrated to affect circadian expression of various genes in different tissues, including the heart. The variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism (rs57875989) in gene Period3 (Per3) is related to multiple phenotypic parameters, including diurnal preference, sleep homeostasis, infection and cancer. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of this polymorphism in AMI with ST elevation (STEMI). The study subjects (314 patients of Caucasian origin with STEMI, and 332 healthy controls) were genotyped for Per3 VNTR polymorphism using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. A gender difference in circadian rhythmicity of pain onset was observed with significant circadian pattern in men. Furthermore, the Per3(5/5) variant carriers were associated with higher levels of interleukin-6, B-type natriuretic peptide and lower vitamin A levels. By using cosinor analysis we observed different circadian distribution patterns of AMI onset at the level of genotype and allelic frequencies. Genotypes with at least one 4-repeat allele (Per3(4/5) and Per3(4/4)) (N = 264) showed remarkable circadian activity in comparison with Per3(5/5) (N = 50), especially in men. No significant differences in genotype and/or allele frequencies of Per3 VNTR polymorphism were observed when comparing STEMI cases and controls. Our results indicate that the Per3 VNTR may contribute to modulation of cardiac functions and interindividual differences in development and progression of myocardial infarction."

Seven hundred eighty-nine consecutive patients (625 men) with first anterior STEMI were included in the analysis. All patients underwent an echocardiographic study within 48 hours of PCI. Women were older and more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal failure, and a higher Killip score. Women had prolonged ischemic time, which was driven by prolonged symptom-to-presentation time (2.75 [interquartile range 1.5 to 4] vs 2 [interquartile range 1 to 3.5] hours, p = 0.005). A higher percentage of women had moderate or worse LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction <40%; 61.6% vs 48%, p = 0.002). In a univariable analysis female gender was associated with moderate or worse LV function (p = 0.002). However, after accounting for variable baseline risk profiles between the 2 groups using multivariable and propensity score techniques, ischemic time >3.5 hours, leukocytosis, and pre-PCI Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade <2 were independent predictors of moderate or worse LV dysfunction, whereas female gender was not. Data on LV function recovery at 6 months, which were available for 45% of female and male patients with moderate or worse LV dysfunction early after PCI, showed no significant gender related difference in LV function recovery. In conclusion, women undergoing PCI for the first event of anterior STEMI demonstrate worse LV function than that of men, which might be partially attributed to delay in presentation. Hence greater efforts should be devoted to increasing women's awareness of cardiac symptoms during the prehospital course of STEMI."

The sex gap diminishes with increasing age and does not appear to exist to the same extent among patients with non-STEMI or unstable angina. Although it is clear that younger women with acute myocardial infarction have higher mortality than do men in the short term; whether this difference is present in the long term remains unclear. Furthermore, women with ACS face delays in diagnosis and treatment, undergo less invasive management, have more bleeding complications, and receive less evidence-based medical therapy than do their male counterparts. Finally, women with ACS consistently report lower health-related quality of life than do men. To date, our understanding of the sex differences in ACS remains limited.

The 30-day mortality rates declined similarly for women (19.4% to 13.9%) and men (13.0% to 9.3%) (sex-year interaction p=0.33). Yet, younger women continued to have excess mortality risk, compared with younger men, even in the most recent period [odds ratio: (2008-09)=1.61 (95% onfidence interval: 1.25, 2.08)].While the overall AMI hospitalization and 30-day mortality rates significantly declined in women and men, hospitalization rates in women ≤55 years increased and their excess risk of 30-day mortality persisted. These findings highlight the need to intensify strategies to reduce the incidence of AMI and improve outcomes after AMI in younger women."

The extent of myocardial ischemia using a 17-segment left ventricular (LV) model was compared to quantitative coronary angiography (QCA).Age (70 ± 12 vs 66 ± 12 years), troponin T level (0.53 ± 0.66 vs 0.75 ± 1.32 µg/l), Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score (3.2 ± 1.4 vs 3.5 ± 1.4), LV ejection fraction and cardiovascular risk factor burden did not differ between genders. As expected, women had less severe findings on coronary angiography but the extent of myocardial ischemia by contrast echocardiography was comparable in women and men. In multivariable analysis, the risk of having prognostically severe angiographic CAD increased by 29% in women and by 49% in men for every additional LV segment with ischemia, independent of TIMI risk score (both p < 0.01).The present contrast echocardiography study in NSTEMI patients demonstrates that women with NSTEMI have the same extent of LV myocardial ischemia as men in spite of less prevalent angiographic CAD. The findings may help explain why less severe angiographic findings in women with NSTEMI are not accompanied by lower mortality."

Seven-year vital status was also ascertained by data linkage with the National Mortality Index.The registry included 449 women and 1593 men with a first myocardial infarction. Compared with men, women were older, had a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, and were more likely to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors but were less likely to receive beta-blockers or thrombolysis. No differences were observed in use of invasive procedures. More women had non-ST-segment elevation and unclassified myocardial infarction than men (37.9% vs 31.3% and 9.8% vs 6.1%, respectively; both P<.001). Case-fatality at 28 days was similar in women and men (5.57% vs 4.46%; P=.39). After multivariate adjustment, the odds ratio of 28-day mortality for men was 1.06 (95% confidence interval: 0.49-2.27; P=.883) compared with women. After multivariate adjustment, men had higher 7-year mortality than women, hazard ratio 1.93 (95% confidence interval: 1.46-2.56; P<.001).There are demographic and clinical differences between men and women with a first myocardial infarction. The short-term prognosis of a first myocardial infarction in this century is similar in both sexes. However, the long-term vital prognosis after a first myocardial infarction is worse in men than in women.

Most studies focus on protection by estrogen, with less attention on androgen receptor-mediated androgen actions. Our aim was to determine the role of androgens in the sex differences in cardiac damage during myocardial infarction. Mature age-matched male and female Sprague Dawley rats, intact or surgically gonadectomized (Gx), received testosterone (T) or 17β-estradiol (E2) via subdermal SILASTIC (Dow Corning Corp.) implants; a subset of male rats received dihydrotestosterone. After 21 days, animals were anesthetized, and hearts were excised and subjected to ex vivo regional ischemia-reperfusion (I-R). Hearts from intact males had larger infarcts than those from females following I-R; Gx produced the opposite effect, confirming a role for sex steroids. In Gx males, androgens (dihydrotestosterone, T) and E2 aggravated I-R-induced cardiac damage, whereas in Gx females, T had no effect and E2 reduced infarct area. Increased circulating T levels up-regulated androgen receptor and receptor for advanced glycation end products, which resulted in enhanced apoptosis aggravating cardiac damage in both males and females. In conclusion, our study demonstrates, for the first time, that sex steroids regulate autophagy during myocardial infarction and shows that a novel mechanism of action for androgens during I-R is down-regulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL (B cell lymphoma-extra large), a key controller for cross talk between autophagy and apoptosis, shifting the balance toward apoptosis and leading to aggravated cardiac damage.

Several data show a higher platelet reactivity in females and a higher prevalence of high platelet reactivity on aspirin and clopidogrel therapy. In primary prevention, the use of aspirin is associated with a higher reduction of risk for ischemic stroke in females and for myocardial infarction in males. In the setting of ACS, female gender is associated with a significantly higher risk of bleeding.

Only studies with at least 5 years of follow-up were reviewed. Of the 1877 identified abstracts, 52 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 39 were included in this review. Most studies included fewer than one-third women. There was significant heterogeneity across studies in patient populations, methodology, and risk adjustment, which produced substantial variability in risk estimates. In general, most studies reported higher unadjusted mortality for women compared with men at both 5 and 10 years after acute myocardial infarction; however, many of the differences in mortality became attenuated after adjustment for age. Multivariable models varied between studies; however, most reported a further reduction in sex differences after adjustment for covariates other than age. Few studies examined sex-by-age interactions; however, several studies reported interactions between sex and treatment whereby women have similar mortality risk as men after revascularization.Sex differences in long-term mortality after acute myocardial infarction are largely explained by differences in age, comorbidities, and treatment use between women and men. Future research should aim to clarify how these differences in risk factors and presentation contribute to the sex gap in mortality."

Data on hospitalizations for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction from 2000 to 2010 were extracted from hospital discharge record databases (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes) in the Lombardy Region of Italy. The impact of female gender on in-hospital mortality was assessed by multivariable regression after adjusting for invasive approach use (i.e., coronary angiography, angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft), age, and co-morbidities. A total of 89,562 patients, men (66.5%) and women (33.5%), were enrolled. The use of an invasive approach increased over time in both sexes although it was higher in men (from 54.9% in 2000 to 91.9% in 2010 in men; from 36.8% in 2000 to 72.0% in 2010 in women). This pattern was driven by the subgroup of patients aged ≥75 years, whereas differences between sexes were not observed in patients <65 years and were small in patients aged 65 to 74 years. In-hospital mortality presented a small decrease from 7.6% in 2000 to 6.2% in 2010 in men (p for trend = 0.004), whereas it remained higher and substantially constant over time in women (16.6% in 2000, 15.5% in 2010, p for trend = 0.09). At multivariable regression, female gender did not emerge as an independent predictor of mortality (p = 0.13). However, a significant gender-age interaction was found, with female gender being a significant predictor of increased mortality in patients aged ≥75 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.33) while predicting a reduced mortality in patients aged <75 years (OR 0.93, p for interaction <0.0001). The use of an invasive approach was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 0.23, p <0.0001), the magnitude of mortality reduction being higher in men than in women and in patients aged <75 years than in those aged ≥75 years. In conclusion, a weak temporal trend in mortality reduction is observed in men only, which is driven by patients aged ≥75 years. In-hospital mortality remains higher in women than in men, although female gender is not a significant predictor of mortality. Despite temporal increases in the use of an invasive approach, women are more often treated conservatively. "

Outcomes included 1-year risk of major adverse cardiac events and bleeding according to Global Utilization of Strategies To Open Occluded Arteries (GUSTO) and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) definitions. Among 6218 patients, 27.5% (n=1712) were female. Compared with men, women were older, had more comorbidities, and had lower functional status. Use of multivessel PCI and drug-eluting stents was similar between sexes, while women received less prasugrel. Unadjusted cumulative incidence of 1-year major adverse cardiac events was higher for women than for men (15.7% versus 13.6%, P=0.02), but female sex was no longer associated with higher incidence of major adverse cardiac events after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15). Female sex was associated with higher risks of post-PCI GUSTO bleeding (9.1% versus 5.7%, P<0.0001) and postdischarge BARC bleeding (39.6% versus 27.9%, P<0.0001). Differences persisted after adjustment (GUSTO: hazard ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.64; BARC: incidence rate ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.56).Female and male myocardial infarction patients undergoing PCI differ regarding demographic, clinical, and treatment profiles. These differences appear to explain the higher observed major adverse cardiac event rate but not higher adjusted bleeding risk for women versus men."

Women were older (70 vs. 64 years) and were more likely than men to have had hyperlipidemia previously diagnosed (10% vs. 2%). During hospitalization, women were less likely to have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with men (57% vs. 74%), and women were more likely to have developed heart failure compared with men (19% vs. 10%). Women experienced higher in-hospital case-fatality rates (CFRs) than men (13% vs. 4%) and these differences were attenuated after adjustment for age and history of hyperlipidemia (OR: 2.64; 95% CI: 1.01, 6.89), and receipt of PCI during hospitalization (OR: 2.09; 95% CI: 0.77, 5.09).Our pilot data suggest that among patients hospitalized with a first AMI in Hanoi, women experienced higher in-hospital CFRs than men. Full-scale surveillance of all Hanoi residents hospitalized with AMI at all Hanoi medical centers is needed to confirm these findings.

Events were registered until the end of 2006. Hazard ratios (HR) (95% confidence intervals) were estimated using Cox regression by comparing normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2) with overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (≥30 kg/m2) patients. Underweight (<18.5 kg/m2) patients were excluded from the study.Of 4131 patients with complete data, 72% were males and 75% were diagnosed with significant CAD. The mean (standard deviation (SD)) age in the total population was 62 (10) years. Mean (SD) BMI was 26.8 (3.9) kg/m2, 34% was normal weight, 48% overweight and 19% obese. During follow up, a total of 337 (8.2%) experienced an AMI and 302 (7.3%) patients died, of whom 165 (4.0%) died from cardiovascular causes. We observed a significant interaction between BMI groups and gender with regards to risk of AMI (p = 0.011) and CV death (p = 0.031), but not to risk of all-cause mortality; obese men had a multivariate adjusted increased risk of AMI (HR 1.80 (1.28, 2.52)) and CV death (HR 1.60 (1.00, 2.55)) compared to normal weight men. By contrast, overweight women had a decreased risk of AMI (HR 0.56 (0.33, 0.98)) compared to normal weight women. The risk of all-cause mortality did not differ between BMI categories.Compared with normal weight subjects, obese men had an increased risk of AMI and CV death, while overweight women had a decreased risk of AMI. These findings may potentially explain some of the result variation in previous studies reporting on the obesity paradox."

Structural equation modeling showed that currently smoking men lost 4.2 more years more than did non-smoking men (P<0.001), and this was mediated through more prematurely occurring MIs. Female current smokers lost 1.9 years more than male current smokers and female ex-smokers lost 1.8 years more than male ex-smokers (both P<0.001).MI caused a substantial number of years of life lost, with a heavier loss in current smokers than in ex-smokers and non-smokers. The effect was predominantly related to the patient's age at the event. More years of life were lost among smoking women than among smoking men, indicating that smoking is most detrimental for the female gender."

Data were collected prospectively among all patients undergoing PPCI for AMI at a large UK tertiary cardiac center between April 2008 and October 2011. A sample of 2,864 patients (women: 844 [29.5%]) underwent PPCI, of which 141 (4.9%) had a confirmed diagnosis of CS.

The overall hospital mortality was 35.5% with no gender difference (male: 35.8% vs female: 35%, p >0.99). In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates that in the contemporary PPCI era, there is a reduction in the incidence of CS with reduced hospital mortality rates and no gender difference. The absence of a gender difference is remarkable because higher proportions of women presented with CS and were older than their male counterparts. Long-term follow-up data are required to determine if this difference is sustained."

The determinants of sex differences in presentation are unclear, and few clues are available as to why young, premenopausal women paradoxically have a greater incidence of adverse outcomes after acute myocardial infarction than men, despite having less-severe coronary artery disease. Although differential treatment on the basis of patient sex continues to be described, the extent to which such inequalities persist and whether they reflect true disparity is unclear. Additionally, much uncertainty surrounds possible sex-related differences in response to cardiovascular therapies, partly because of a persistent lack of female-specific data from cardiovascular clinical trials. In this Review, we assess the evidence for sex-related differences in the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of IHD, and identify gaps in the literature that need to be addressed in future research efforts."

Research has demonstrated a gender-specific response of cardiomyocytes to ischemia and a potential increase in myocardial salvage in women compared with men. Myocardial blush grade (MBG), an angiographic surrogate of myocardial perfusion, is an independent predictor of early and late survival after AMI. Whether the incidence and prognosis of myocardial perfusion differs according to gender among patients with AMI undergoing PCI is unknown. MBG and short- and long-term mortality were evaluated in 1,301 patients (male = 935; female = 366) with AMI randomized to primary angioplasty ± abciximab versus stent ± abciximab. Following PCI, >96% of patients achieved final Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 3 flow, of which MBG 2/3 was present in 58.3% of women versus 51.1% of men (p = 0.02). Worse MBG was an independent predictor of mortality in women at 30 days (7.4% for MBG 0/1 vs 2.4% for MBG 2/3, p = 0.04) and at 1-year (11.0% for MBG 0/1 vs 3.4% for MBG 2/3, p = 0.01); however, MBG was not associated with differences in mortality for men. In conclusion, impaired myocardial perfusion following PCI for AMI, indicated by worse MBG, is an independent predictor of early and late mortality in women but not in men. These findings imply an enhanced survival benefit from restoring myocardial perfusion for women compared with men during primary angioplasty and may have clinical implications for interventional strategies in women.

In this prespecified analysis, women in the CCTA arm had a greater reduction in length of stay, lower hospital admission rates, and lesser increased cumulative radiation dose than men in a comparison of ED strategies (P for interaction ≤0.02). Although women had lower acute coronary syndrome rates than men (3% versus 12%; P<0.0001), sex differences in length of stay persisted after adjustment for baseline differences, including acute coronary syndrome rate (P for interaction <0.03). Length of stay was similar between sexes with normal CCTA findings (P=0.11). There was no missed acute coronary syndrome for either sex. No difference was observed in major adverse cardiac events between sexes and ED strategies (P for interaction =0.39). Women had more normal CCTA examinations than men (58% versus 37%; P<0.0001), less obstructive coronary disease by CCTA (5% versus 17%; P=0.0001), but similar normalcy rates for functional testing (P=0.65). Men in the CCTA arm had the highest rate of invasive coronary angiography (18%), whereas women had comparable low 5% rates regardless of ED strategy.This trial provides data supporting an early CCTA strategy as an attractive option in women presenting to the ED with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.

Men and women were compared in the entire cohort and in subgroups divided by age (aged < 75 years vs aged ≥ 75 years) and revascularization availability at presenting hospital. Logistic regression was used to determine the adjusted effect of sex on mortality and to determine predictors of revascularization.The incidence of CS was higher in women (3.7% of female vs 2.7% of male AMI patients; P < 0.001). Women with CS were older than men (mean age: 75.5 vs 71.1 years; P < 0.001) and less likely to present to revascularization-capable sites (16% vs 19.2%; P < 0.001). Unadjusted 1-year mortality rates were higher in women (80.3% vs 75.4%; P < 0.001).

The strongest predictor of revascularization was presentation to a revascularization-capable site (odds ratio, 17.69; P < 0.001). After regression adjustment, there were no significant differences in mortality or revascularization between the sexes.Women with CS are older than men with CS and are less likely to present to revascularization-capable sites.

After two years, 18% of respondents reported depression together with fatigue and 30% reported fatigued without depression. Women scored higher than men on the fatigue dimensions reduced activity, reduced motivation and mental fatigue. Moreover, the physical dimension of health-related quality of life two years after myocardial infarction was predicted by experienced general fatigue at four months.Fatigue with or without coexisting possible/probable depression remains as a significant symptom two years after myocardial infarction in nearly half of the entire group.Fatigue is a problem following myocardial infarction.

Summarized data were analyzed.Of 5061 patients, 1142 (23%) were women. Women were more frequently diagnosed with non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI [43%]) than unstable angina (UA [29%]) or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI [29%]).

More men had a history of coronary artery disease. More women received angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and fewer had percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Gender differences in the subset of STEMI patients were similar to those in the entire cohort. However, gender differences in the subset of STEMI showed fewer women given b-blockers, and an insignificant PCI difference between genders. Thrombolysis rates between genders were similar.

Sex differences in cardiac hemodynamic parameters such as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) have not been examined and might play an important role. The objectives of the present study were to examine whether female sex is an independent determinant of PCWP during acute STEMI and whether an elevated PCWP contributes to all-cause 30-day mortality and re-infarction in women. The clinical, angiographic, and hemodynamic features of 470 consecutive patients with STEMI (n = 135 women) undergoing emergency coronary angiography with right-side heart catheterization were evaluated with respect to sex. Women had an elevated PCWP (20 ± 8 vs 16 ± 7 mm Hg, p <0.001) and reduced mixed venous oxygen saturation (67 ± 11% vs 71 ± 9%, p = 0.004). On multivariate analysis, female sex (β = 4.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.04 to 6.04, p <0.001), hypertension (β = 2.07, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.83, p = 0.021), and creatine kinase-estimated infarct size (β = 0.001, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.002, p ≤0.001) were independent predictors of an elevated PCWP. Female sex exerted a minor independent effect on 30-day mortality and re-infarction (odds ratio 2.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.46, p = 0.008). However, once PCWP was entered into the mediation model, sex was no longer significant, suggesting that the effect of sex on the post-STEMI outcomes is potentially mediated through PCWP (odds ratio 1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.12, p = 0.011). In conclusion, during acute STEMI, women have greater left ventricular filling pressures compared with men, independent of age, hypertension, and infarct size. The biologic explanation for this difference requires additional investigation, although it does not appear to contribute to the increased 30-day mortality and re-infarction rate observed in women. "

However, nowadays, coronary artery disease constitutes the leading cause of death in women, although there are a lot of gender-related differences regarding the presentation of acute myocardial infarction, its diagnosis, its treatment, short- and long-term mortality rates, and post-acute myocardial infarction complications. Generally, women have smaller and stiffer hearts and cardiac vessels, suffering a greater extent of atherosclerosis and endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction. They are usually older than men and they have more comorbidities such as hypertension, renal impairment, and diabetes mellitus. Moreover, female coronary artery disease, the diagnosis of which is more complicated due to more false negative results of some diagnostic methods in women, is more often presented with atypical symptoms and women's symptoms of typical or atypical angina are more severe. Furthermore, women delay significantly more in seeking care and they are more frequently undertreated. Finally, women are associated with generally poorer in-hospital and long-term prognosis having almost two-fold higher early mortality and they are more prone to complications such as bleeding complications, shock, and heart failure, as well as to post-myocardial infarction depression and poorer physical function and mental health.

National Health Insurance (NHI) files were used to obtain information on a cohort of 79,360 AMI patients aged 30-85 years in Taiwan from 1997 to 2007. The use of catheterization and revascularization (CATH/RAVS) and one-year mortality were compared between men and women in all adult patients, health professionals and their relatives, and non-health professional patients. Taiwanese women with AMI were significantly less likely than their male counterparts to receive CATH/RAVS, and showed greater one-year mortality. Similarly, women in the professional group were significantly less likely to receive CATH/RAVS. However, they did not have worse survival outcomes (hazard ratio: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.68-1.50) compared to men. Regarding mortality following CATH/RAVS, no gender disparities against women were observed in health professionals and their relatives, whereas significant gender disparities persisted in non-health professional patients.

STEMI infarct location was assessed by 12-lead electrocardiograms from the hospital record and was coded as anterior, inferior, lateral, and multilocation STEMIs using the Minnesota code. From 1987 to 2008, a total of 4,845 patients had an incident STEMI; 37.2% were inferior STEMI, 32.8% were anterior, 16.8% occurred in multiple infarct locations, and 13.2% were lateral STEMI. For inferior, anterior, and lateral STEMIs in both men and women, significant decreases were observed in the age-adjusted annual incidence and the associated 28-day case fatality. In contrast, for STEMI in multiple infarct locations, neither the annual incidence nor the 28-day case fatality changed over time. The age- and race-adjusted annual incidence and associated 28-day case fatality of STEMI in anterior, inferior, and lateral infarct locations decreased during 22 years of surveillance; however, no decrease was observed for STEMI in multiple infarct locations. In conclusion, our findings suggest that there is room for improvement in the care of patients with multilocation STEMI. "

After adjustment for important confounders (body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and physical activity) the associations with active and passive smoking were still statistically significant. Adjusting for active smoking when assessing the effect of passive smoking and vice versa, indicated that the effect of passive smoking in men may be explained by their own active smoking. In women, living with a smoker ≥30 years after the age of 20 increased the myocardial infarction risk by 40 %, even after adjusting for active smoking.

Gender differences were evaluated in the clinical outcomes of 6,929 consecutive patients with acute coronary syndromes from a large, contemporary PCI registry. Rates of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization at 1-year follow-up, are reported. Independent correlates of adverse outcomes were identified using multivariate proportional-hazards regression analysis. Women were older (p <0.001); had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (p <0.001), systemic hypertension (p <0.001), chronic renal insufficiency (p = 0.02), peripheral arterial disease (p <0.001), and congestive heart failure (p <0.001); had lower body surface areas (p <0.001); and had higher body mass indexes (p <0.001).

Still contrasting are data on the effect of gender on the outcome in patients with STEMI undergoing primary angioplasty. In particular, it is still unclear whether a larger infarct size might contribute to the explanation of the worse outcome in women. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate gender-related differences in infarct size as evaluated by myocardial scintigraphy in a large cohort of patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We included 830 patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The infarct size was evaluated at 30 days using technetium-99m-sestamibi. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relation between gender and infarct size (as percentage of patients above the median) after correction for baseline confounding factors. We also evaluated the presence of a potential age-gender interaction. A total of 183 patients (20.8%) were women. Female gender was associated with more advanced age and a greater prevalence of hypertension; previous infarction and smoking were more frequently observed in men. Female gender was associated with a smaller infarct size (p <0.001) that was confirmed after correction for baseline confounding factors (adjusted odds ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.7, p <0.001).

In the non-emergency reperfusion group (n = 675), in-hospital mortality occurred in 13.0% of the males and 22.9% of the females (P = 0.001). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis revealed female sex as an independent risk factor of death for STEMI patients during hospitalization (OR = 1.691, P = 0.007). After controlling for patients who died within 24 hr after admission, female sex was no longer an independent risk factor (OR = 1.409, P = 0.259).Female sex was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality of STEMI patients, which is explained by an excess of very early deaths."

A sub-analysis of the TAXUS Japan Post-market Surveillance Study (TAXUS-PMS) was done to assess the influence of gender on clinical outcome. A total of 2,132 PES-treated Japanese patients (women, n=551) from this registry were analyzed. Subjects were stratified by gender to compare 1-year clinical outcome. PES-treated women were older and more likely to have insulin-treated diabetes and hypertension. In contrast, PES-treated men were more likely to be smokers, have a previous history of myocardial infarction, and lower ejection fraction. While cardiac death, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis were similar between men and women, major cardiac events tended to be lower in women than in men (6.4% vs. 8.8%, P=0.08). Although women had significantly smaller reference vessel size (2.46±0.53 mm vs. 2.59±0.60 mm, P<0.0001), the restenosis rate tended to be lower in women than in men (11.5% vs. 14.8%, P=0.11). Subsequently, the target lesion revascularization rate was significantly lower in women than in men (4.2% vs. 6.5%, P<0.05). Despite a higher risk profile, Japanese women treated with PES did not have a higher rate of repeat revascularization or major adverse clinical outcome than PES-treated men at 1 year. "

Given the strong relationship between sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and outcome, we hypothesized there may be a sex difference in SNA responses to MI. In anaesthetized, open-chest male, female and ovariectomized (OVX) female Wistar rats, mean arterial pressure, heart rate and renal SNA were recorded in response to ligation of the left coronary artery. In males, renal SNA increased by 30 ± 6% in the first minute of coronary occlusion (P < 0.05) and remained elevated at 18 ± 7% above baseline (P < 0.05) at 2 h following MI. In response to MI, ovary-intact females displayed no change in renal SNA, whereas OVX females displayed a significant increase, similar to that seen in the males (increases of 43 ± 11% at 1 min and 21 ± 7% at 2 h post-MI, P < 0.05 versus intact females). Arterial baroreflex control of renal SNA had a smaller range in females (ovary intact and OVX) than males; no changes in arterial baroreflex responses were observed 1 h post-MI in males or females. Denervating the arterial baroreceptors abolished the renal SNA response to MI in the males, whereas in ovary-intact females and OVX females the response was unaltered. These findings suggest that ovarian hormones are able to blunt the initial sympathetic activation post-MI in females and that the importance of the arterial baroreflex in mediating initial sympathetic activation post-MI is different between the sexes."

Mortality, stroke and composite event (stroke/death) were compared between procedures after matching of patients by propensity score. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was our secondary 'end' point.More than 90% of patients in both sexes were asymptomatic (27,439 women and 36,295 men). Compared to men, asymptomatic women experienced more strokes after CEA (women: 1.38%, men: 1.16%, P = 0.03) and higher AMI rates after both procedures (CEA; women: 0.75%, men: 0.51%, P = 0.0009, CAS; women: 0.96%, men: 0.28%, P = 0.01). Between procedures, symptomatic women undergoing CAS showed higher rates of mortality (CAS: 4.19%, CEA: 0.47%, P = 0.01) and combined (stroke/mortality) events (CAS: 12.09%, CEA: 6.05%, P = 0.02). In all other cohorts, no statistically significant difference was found between the procedures.Compared to CEA, CAS led to inferior in-hospital outcomes only in symptomatic women in the last decade in NYS. Men and asymptomatic women showed comparable outcomes after both procedures, whereas asymptomatic females were more prone to AMI after both interventions. These sex-associated differences should be taken into account for the treatment of carotid artery disease."

For each period, we present attack rates and trends analysis. Hospital lethality takes again in-patients and community lethality is calculated starting from all the cases.The total attack rate is rather stable between 1983 and 2007 for women (from 12 to 19 per 10,000 residents). For men, there is a distinct decline of the total attack rate since 1991 till 1993 (63 to 43 per 10,000 residents). We systematically observe a reduction in risk between men and women according to the age. For each 5-year period, this risk decreases significantly with age and this difference is strongest during the periods 1993-1997 and 1998-2002. The analysis shows also a significant decline in lethality between the 1983-1987 and 1993-1997 periods. Among women, lethality is systematically higher than in men in spite of the presence or the absence of antecedents of myocardial infarction.Favourable evolutions in the attack rates of acute coronary events in the study population appear clearly on the 25-year period of observation. The whole lethality rates decreased during the first 15 years of the register; after that, it stabilized."

Included were patients meeting criteria for an MI Alert (an institutional clinical practice guideline designed to expedite cardiac catheterization for STEMI patients). Data points (before and after initiation of a prehospital alert protocol) were compared and used as markers of therapy: time to ECG, receiving β-blockers, and time to the catheterization laboratory (cath lab). Differences in categorical variables by patient sex were assessed using the χ(2) test. Medians were estimated as the measure of central tendency. Quantile regression models were used to assess differences in median times between subgroups.A total of 1231 MI Alert charts were identified and analyzed.

This is of great importance, given that CVD has become the number 1 killer of women, and unlike for men, mortality rates do not seem to be declining. Many factors are cited as the causes of sex-based differences, including delays in recognizing symptoms, underutilization of diagnostic tests and treatments, as well as anatomic, physiological, and genetic factors. Evidence of fundamental biological differences in vascular function and the underlying pathologic processes is only beginning to elucidated, motivated by growing evidence of differences in clinical presentations and outcomes between men and women. The good news is that we are starting to see improvements in outcomes for women, such as after coronary revascularization; decrease in complication rates with the advent of new techniques, such as radial access for cardiac catheterizations; as well as increased participation of women in clinical trials. The underlying mechanisms of ischemic heart disease remain to be elucidated, and will help guide therapy and ultimately may explain the higher prevalence of : subendocardial myocardial infarctions, spontaneous arterial dissections, plaque erosion, increased vasospastic disorders, such as coronary microvascular disease, and pulmonary hypertension in women compared with men.

Short-term prognosis improved in women over the studied period; similar rates were observed in both sexes in the 2000s. After adjusting for age, co-morbidities and anterior location of MI, female sex had an odds ratio=1.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-2.17) of short-term severe MI or death over the studied period. Overall, sex differences in long-term prognosis remained similar over the studied period (hazard ratio=1.40; 95% CI 1.02-1.91). In conclusion, short-term prognosis improved over the past 30 years for first Q-wave MI patients, becoming similar for both men and women in the most recent decade. Long-term prognosis did not improve in either men or women, indicating that secondary prevention should be reinforced to achieve consistent reductions in the number of cardiovascular events."

All patients were followed up for at least 3 years or until the occurrence of a major event. The primary end point was all-cause death. The secondary end point was the combined occurrence of death or myocardial (re-)infarction (MI).The adjusted in-hospital and long-term clinical outcomes were similar between men and women. However, in-hospital revascularization significantly reduced long-term mortality and composite endpoint in men (P < 0.001), but not in women. After risk stratification by GRACE score, there was favorable effect of invasive strategy in high-risk women. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, GRACE score (hazard ratio; HR, 1.017; P < 0.001) and in-hospital revascularization (HR, 0.516; P = 0.008) were the independent predictors of death or MI in men. However, only GRACE score was the independent predictor of composite endpoint in women (HR, 1.012; P = 0.004).In Asian ethnic patients with NSTEMI, the in-hospital and long-term prognosis were similar between men and women.

The Japanese journal of clinical pathology,2012 May,CLIN,Human,na,,"In the present study, we evaluated the performance and clinical utility of a high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT) assay. The within- and between-assay variations (coefficients of variation: CV) in the low and high concentrations of troponin T in serum samples were 0.84% to 3.34%, respectively. Analysis of interferents showed that only hemoglobin negatively influenced the assay results. Blank assay was < 0.001 ng/mL, and a limit of quantification (10% CV) was found at 0.005 ng/mL. The correlation coefficient (r) between hs-cTnT and the conventional assay was 0.997 (p < 0.000). The high-sensitivity assay system could detect cTnT in 88% of samples in which the conventional assay could not detect any immunoreactivity. The 99th percentile in healthy subjects, determined using 559 samples from medical checkups, was 0.011 ng/mL. There was a gender difference (hs-cTnT levels were higher in men than in women), and hs-cTnT levels increased with age. Because hs-cTnT level exceeded 0.011 ng/mL approximately 2 hours after the onset of chest pain in patients with acute myocardial infarction, hs-cTnT can serve as a biomarker for early detection of myocardial infarction. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.491, p < 0.001) between hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP, and hs-cTnT levels increased with the progression of the disease state, as assessed using New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. These findings indicate that the hs-cTnT assay is sensitive enough to diagnose early-stage acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure."

Our goal was to assess the feasibility of using a business management query system to create an automated data report that could identify deficiencies in standards of care and be used to improve the quality of treatment we provide our patients.Over a 12-month period, key markers for patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) were tracked (e.g., time to electrocardiogram, door to medications). During this time, educational endeavors were initiated utilizing McKesson's Horizon Business Insight™ (McKesson Information Solutions, Alpharetta, GA) to illustrate gender differences in standard therapy. Subsequently, indicators were evaluated for improvement.Substantial improvements in key indicators for management of NSTEMI were obtained and gender differences minimized where education was provided.The integration of these information systems allowed us to create a successful performance improvement tool and, as an added benefit, nearly eliminated the need for manual retrospective chart reviews."

Ischemic heart disease was defined as the presence of (1) history of angina pectoris or angina equivalent symptoms and critical care unit admission, (2) myocardial infarction and/or electrocardiographic evidence of Q-wave myocardial infarction, (3) coronary revascularization and/or stenting, (4) positive myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography scan, (5) ischemic ST-segment or T-wave changes, and (6) positive stress testing.Patients with albuminuria had a lower glomerular filtration rate and a longer diabetes duration than patients without albuminuria. In the group of cases, there were a greater number of men with ischemic heart disease (120 of 370; 32.4%) compared to women (97 of 559; 17.4%) (P<0.001). The odds ratio of having ischemic heart disease according to the presence or absence of albuminuria was 1.25 [95% CI: 1.01-1.56] (P<0.05) in all studied populations, 0.79 [95% CI: 0.51-1.21] (P=0.14) in women, and 2.84 [95% CI: 1.68-4.79] (P<0.001) in men. We showed that diabetes duration, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and hemoglobin A(1c) influence albuminuria in women, while diabetes duration, fasting blood sugar, and diastolic blood pressure influence albuminuria in men.Men with albuminuria are at increased risk of ischemic heart disease compared to women.

Analyzing nationwide multicenter prospective registries in Korea, the aim of this study was to determine whether female gender independently imposes a risk for mortality. Data from 14,253 patients who were hospitalized for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction from November 2005 to September 2010 were extracted from registries. Compared to men, women were older (mean age 56 ± 12 vs 67 ± 10 years, p < 0.001), and female gender was associated with a higher frequency of co-morbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Women had longer pain-to-door time and more severe hemodynamic status than men. All-cause mortality rates were 13.6% in women and 7.0% in men at 1 year after the index admission (hazard ratio for women 2.01, 95% confidence interval 1.80 to 2.25, p < 0.001). The risk for death after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction corresponded highly with age. Although the risk remained high after adjusting for age, further analyses adjusting for medical history, clinical performance, and hemodynamic status diminished the gender effect (hazard ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.17, p = 0.821). Propensity score matching, as a sensitivity analysis, corroborated the results. In conclusion, this study shows that women have a comparable risk for death after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction as men. The gender effect was accounted for mostly by the women's older age, complex co-morbidities, and severe hemodynamic conditions at presentation."

Do women have distinctive characteristics?].,Giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006),2012 Jun,REVIEW,Human,na,,"More women die every year from cardiovascular disease than men from any other cause. Several fundamental variations have been reported in the mechanisms underlying coronary artery disease, which suggest that its genetic basis varies by gender. Such differences are not limited to gonadal hormones and can be seen in the physiology of atherosclerosis, including plaque components, endothelial function and hemostasis. It is possible to speculate that genetic factors are different in men and women and probably involve biological pathways that have not yet been identified. To date, studies performed by means of the candidate gene approach have identified several genetic variants associated with coronary artery disease in women. However, these scientific data have not been translated into clinical practice. It has recently become possible to search for common gene variants that affect the susceptibility to myocardial infarction on the basis of our knowledge of common single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes across the human genome using genome-wide genotyping technologies. Currently more than 20 gene regions have been associated with ischemic heart disease using this approach. However, so far we do not know several genetic variants differently associated with risk of ischemic heart disease in men and women. A challenge for the near future will therefore be to identify genetic variants that maximally differentiate males from females, and also to identify possible relationships between genes and environment and genes and hormones in both sexes."

Gender-specific associations during 12 years of follow-up for all-cause mortality and 9.5 years for myocardial infarction (MI) and ischaemic stroke were assessed (Cox proportional hazard ratios, HRs).During follow-up, 591 MIs, 293 ischaemic strokes and 1262 deaths occurred. In women, HR for all-cause mortality was increased in the upper cystatin C quartile (≥0.93 mg/L) compared with the lowest quartile (≤0.73 mg/L); 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.84. A significant interaction with gender was observed. One SD (0.17 mg/L) increase in cystatin C was associated with 9% higher risk of death in women, also when persons with a cancer history were excluded. Crude HRs for MI and ischaemic stroke were increased in both genders, but the associations did not persist after multivariable adjustments. No independent associations with end points were observed in non-gender-specific analyses.Cystatin C was not independently associated with fatal and non-fatal MI or ischaemic stroke in the general population.

Men were more likely than women to suffer from AMI after cardiac surgery (11.8% vs. 5.6%), as a result of the higher frequency of STEMI (6% of men vs. 1.8% of women; P < 0.001) in both age groups. A troponin-I (Tn-I) peak was significantly higher in patients ≥ 70 years old. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients ≥ 70 (7.3%) than in those < 70 years old (3.3%), because of the increased mortality observed in men with non-AMI (2.1% vs. 6.3%) and women with STEMI (0% vs. 28.6%) and non-STEMI (0% vs. 36.8%, P < 0.05). Old age was associated with a higher frequency of non-STEMI, Tn-I peak, mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU).

T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI was used to assess myocardial salvage, infarct size, and microvascular obstruction. The primary clinical end point was mortality within 6 months after the index event. The amount of myocardium at risk and final infarct size did not differ significantly between women and men. Consequently, myocardial salvage was similar between groups (P=0.36). Women had a higher in-hospital (3% versus 10%; P=0.03) and 30-day (5% versus 11%; P=0.05) mortality rate than did men. Six months after infarction, no significant sex differences in survival were obvious (11% versus 7%; P=0.21). After adjustment for baseline differences (age, diabetes, hypertension), female sex was not an independent predictor of mortality and major adverse cardiac events.The efficacy of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (myocardial salvage) in patients with STEMI is not sex dependent. Although women STEMI patients had worse unadjusted in-hospital and 30-day clinical outcomes than did men, multivariate analysis revealed that the observed sex-based differences in early death after STEMI were likely related to differences in baseline risk and clinical characteristics."

However, after adjustment for baseline confounders and bleeding, female gender was associated with a lower risk of 1-year death. Thus, adjusted 1-year mortality was similar in women compared to men without bleeding (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.19) but lower in women compared to men with bleeding (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98, p for interaction of gender by bleeding = 0.0016). The highest adjusted 1-year mortality was observed in men with bleeding (HR 2.42, 95% CI 2.20 to 2.66) followed by women with bleeding (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.33) and women without bleeding (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.19, referent men without bleeding). In conclusion, in patients with fibrinolytic-treated STEMI, women had a higher incidence but lower mortality with bleeding than men. These data highlight the importance of understanding factors associated with gender-related differences in bleeding and represent an opportunity for improving outcomes of women and men with fibrinolytic-treated STEMI."

Female patients were older than male patients [(68.2 ± 9.1) years vs. (60.3 ± 12.1) years]. On admission, heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and Killip class were higher and the delay between onset of chest pain and arrival at hospital was longer in female patients than in male patients (all P < 0.01). Male patients often presented MI in anterior leads while female patients often presented MI in inferior and lateral leads. History of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and heart failure was significantly higher in female than in male patients (all P < 0.01). Incidence of high blood glucose was higher in female while high blood potassium was higher in male patients (P < 0.01). Rate of reperfusion therapy was lower and the use aspirin and diuretic was more frequent in female patients than in male patients, while frequency of clopidogrel, Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor, β-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lipid-lowering drug use was significantly higher in male than in female patients (all P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender was a predictor for less PCI therapy (P < 0.01). Thirty-day all cause mortality (OR = 1.425, 95%CI: 1.163 - 1.747, P < 0.01) and combined end points (OR = 1.193, 95%CI: 1.010 - 1.410, P = 0.04) were significantly higher in female patients than in male patients.There are gender-related differences on therapeutic approach and short-term outcome in Chinese STEMI patients. The unfavorable demographic and baseline clinical profile could partially explain the less reperfusion therapy rate and worse prognosis in female patients."

Biomarker adjustment accounted for change from reliance on cardiac enzymes to widespread use of troponin measurements over time. During 1987-2008, a total of 30 985 fatal or nonfatal hospitalized acute MI events occurred. Rates of CHD death among persons without a history of MI fell an average 4.7%/y among men and 4.3%/y among women. Rates of both in- and out-of-hospital CHD death declined significantly throughout the period. Age- and biomarker-adjusted average annual rate of incident MI decreased 4.3% among white men, 3.8% among white women, 3.4% among black women, and 1.5% among black men. Declines in CHD mortality and MI incidence were greater in the second decade (1997-2008). Failure to account for biomarker shift would have masked declines in incidence, particularly among blacks. Age-adjusted 28-day case fatality after hospitalized MI declined 3.5%/y among white men, 3.6%/y among black men, 3.0%/y among white women, and 2.6%/y among black women.Although these findings from 4 communities may not be directly generalizable to blacks and whites in the entire United States, we observed significant declines in MI incidence, primarily as a result of downward trends in rates between 1997 and 2008."

All these factors can account for the higher in-ICCU mortality in women and strongly suggest that STEMI women deserve more intensive care due to a more severe haemodynamic derangement (as indicated by the higher use of inotropes, diuretics, and non-invasive ventilation) and to a more serious metabolic impairment (as inferred by higher glucose values)."

Relative risks (RR) of AMI incidence were estimated by mean equivalent household income at neighbourhood-level for strata of age and gender using Poisson regression models. Socioeconomic inequalities were also shown within the stratified age-gender groups by calculating the total number of events attributable to socioeconomic disadvantage.Between 1997 and 2007, 317,564 people had a first AMI. When comparing the most deprived socioeconomic quintile with the most affluent quintile, the overall RR for AMI was 1.34 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.32-1.36) in men and 1.44 (95 % CI: 1.42-1.47) in women. The socioeconomic gradient decreased with age. Relative socioeconomic inequalities were most apparent in men under 35 years and in women under 65 years. The largest number of events attributable to socioeconomic inequalities was found in men aged 45-74 years and in women aged 65-84 years. The total proportion of AMIs that was attributable to socioeconomic inequalities in the Dutch population of 1997 to 2007 was 14 % in men and 18 % in women.Neighbourhood socioeconomic inequalities were observed in AMI incidence in the Netherlands, but the magnitude across age-gender groups depended on whether inequality was expressed in relative or absolute terms.

While the prescription volumes for both men and women have, for some time, been similar or have even risen for the men, there are still characteristic differences between the sexes when it comes to the prescription of certain indication groups. Women are still prescribed clearly more drugs in the field of psychotropic medication, especially antidepressants, hypnotic drugs, and tranquilisers. As the American Beers criteria for quite some time now and, more recently, the German PRISCUS list have shown, the effects of such drugs are potentially dangerous, particularly for older women. The known adverse effects are, apart from dependence problems, restricted cognitive capacities, insecure or instable walking, and badly healing wounds from falling accidents that are followed by patient's nursing care dependency. In secondary prophylaxis after acute myocardial infarction, the characteristic prescription features of the various medicinal products that are used for both men and women (such as platelet aggregation inhibitors, beta-receptor blockers, ACE-inhibitors, statins) have become similar; women's still higher mortality risk appears to go back to the fact that too much time is spent before proper hospital treatment commences. In general, more attention should be paid to the right medication, the right length of treatment, and the right dosage of the medication prescribed to women; the evidence concerning women's supply of medicinal products should also be improved."

Diet was assessed by a validated modified diet history method, combining a 7-d registration of cooked meals and cold beverages, a 168-item food questionnaire (covering other foods and meal patterns), and a 1-hour diet interview. Sociodemographic and lifestyle data were collected by questionnaire. iCVD cases, which included coronary events (myocardial infarctions or deaths from chronic ischemic heart disease) and ischemic strokes, were ascertained via national and local registries. Nutrient-disease associations were examined by multivariate Cox regressions.During a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, we identified 1,089 male and 687 female iCVD cases. High fiber intakes were associated with lower incidence rates of iCVD in women and of ischemic stroke in men. In post-hoc analysis, we discovered statistically significant interactions between intake of fiber and saturated fat; these interactions also differed between men and women (p<0.001).In this well-defined population, a high fiber intake was associated with lower risk of iCVD, but there were no robust associations between other macronutrients and iCVD risk.

One-year mortality was gender equal, HR 0.95 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.05) and 0.96 (0.86 to 1.08), after adding evidence-based medicine to the multivariable adjustments.In spite of an intense gender debate, focus on guideline adherence and the change in reperfusion strategy, the last decade gender differences in use of reperfusion therapy and evidence-based therapy at discharge did not decline during the study period, rather the opposite. Moreover, higher mortality in women persisted."

In order to investigate a possible gender difference in the prognostic value of a reduced renal function, a comparison was made between the HRs of male and female patients and an interaction term was added to the model and tested for significance. Adjustments were made for age, body mass index, history of diabetes or hypertension, systolic blood pressure and heart rate, anterior myocardial infarction and time to treatment.In male patients, a reduced renal function was associated with increased 3-year mortality (adjusted HR 6.31, 95% CI 3.74 to 10.63, p<0.001). A reduced renal function was associated with a twofold increase in the mortality hazard in female patients (adjusted HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.94, p=0.006).In this large single-centre registry of STEMI patients undergoing PPCI, renal dysfunction as assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate had prognostic significance for mortality in both male and female patients."

Results are varied, however, and reliable, comprehensive data for changes in cardiac myocyte shape are not available.Young adult female and male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study and randomly assigned to the myocardial infarction and sham myocardial infarction groups. Myocardial infarction was produced by ligation of the left descending coronary artery. Four weeks after surgery, left ventricular echocardiography and hemodynamics were performed before isolating myocytes for size determination.In general, left ventricular functional changes after myocardial infarction were comparable. Females developed slightly, but significantly, more left ventricular hypertrophy than males, and this was reflected by the relative increases in left ventricular myocyte volume. In both males and females, however, myocyte hypertrophy was due exclusively to lengthening of myocytes with no change in myocyte cross-sectional area.This study demonstrates that post-myocardial infarction changes in LV function and myocyte remodeling are remarkably similar in young adult male and female rats."

The patients were divided into 2 groups: 1,810 patients < 70 years old and 867 patients ≥ 70 years old. Women were older and had a greater incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus and a lower incidence of current smoking and previous myocardial infarction in both groups. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly greater in women ≥ 70 years old age than in men ≥ 70 years old (16.2% vs 9.3%, respectively; p = 0.003) but was comparable between women and men in patients < 70 years old (5.7% vs 4.9%, respectively; p = 0.59).

Using an analysis of pairs, matched on a conditional probability of being male (propensity score), we assessed the effect of the baseline characteristics and management on 30-day mortality. Consecutive patients were included from January 2006 to December 2007. Two propensity scores (for being male) were calculated, 1 from the baseline characteristics and 1 from both the baseline characteristics and treatment. Two matched cohorts were composed using 1:1 matching and computed using the best 8 digits of the propensity score. Paired analyses were performed using conditional regression analysis. During the study period, 3,510 patients were included in the registry; 1,119 (32%) were women. Compared to the men, the women were 10 years older, had more co-morbidities, less often underwent angiography and reperfusion, and received less medical treatment. The 30-day mortality rate was 12.3% (130 of 1,060) for the women and 7.2% (167 of 2,324) for the men (p <0.001). The 2 matched populations represented 1,298 and 1,168 patients. After matching using the baseline characteristics, the only difference in treatment was a lower rate of angiography and reperfusion, with a trend toward greater 30-day mortality in women. After matching using both baseline characteristics and treatment, the 30-day mortality was similar for the men and women, suggesting that the increased use of invasive procedures in women could potentially be beneficial. In conclusion, compared to men, the 30-day mortality is greater in women and explained primarily by differences in baseline characteristics and to a lesser degree by differences in management. The difference in the use of invasive procedures persisted after matching by characteristics. In contrast, after matching using the baseline characteristics and treatment, the 30-day mortality was comparable across the genders."

Pulmonary congestion and hypertension were more likely in women with higher serum levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. A higher prevalence of current smoking and inferior wall involvement and lower serum HDL cholesterol level were observed in man. After adjusting for age, adverse in-hospital mortality for women was observed in both younger and older patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age, location of infarction, recanalization and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration were independent predictors for in-hospital mortality for overall patients, while age and recanalization were independent predictors for male gender, and pulmonary congestion and serum CRP concentration were independent predictors for female gender.

Data from two large population based registers, FINAMI and the Finnish National Cardiovascular Disease Register (CVDR) were used to determine whether the CF of incident MI events has declined less in women than in men. All patients aged 35 and over were included. CF was calculated for different time periods after the onset of the MI event, the main emphasis was in pre-hospital, 28-day, and 1-year CF. Figures were compared between two study periods: 1994-1996 and 2000-2002. A total of 6,342 incident MI events were recorded in FINAMI and 117,632 events in CVDR during the study periods. Comparison between the two study periods showed that the CF was generally declining. However, a slower decline in short-term CF was seen among young (aged<55 years) women (P for sex by study period interaction in pre-hospital CF=0.028 in FINAMI and 0.003 in CVDR, and for 28-day CF P=0.016 in FINAMI and <0.0001 in CVDR). In conclusion, the short and long-term prognosis of MI events has improved in both sexes. Pre-hospital CF has declined less among younger women than among men and among older women. This slower decline in early CF was responsible for the slower improvement in 28-day and 1-year prognosis in young women."

Primary end-point of the study was post-procedural epicardial and myocardial perfusion. Secondary end-points were the 30-day and 6-month composite occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE).Women with STEMI had higher risk factor profiles than men. Although PPCI achieved equal rates of successful epicardial reperfusion, women tended to have impaired microvascular reperfusion as reflected by lower rates of normal TIMI myocardial perfusion grade (P=0.007) and complete ST-segment resolution (P=0.079). After adjustment for the risk profiles, multivariable analysis showed that gender itself was not an independent predictor of impaired microvascular reperfusion. Both female gender and impaired myocardial reperfusion were independent predictors of 30-day MACE, whereas gender lost its prognostic significance for 6-month MACE. Multivariable analysis restricted to female patients identified incomplete ST-segment resolution as the strongest determinant of 30-day MACE.The differences in microvascular reperfusion after PPCI between women and men are attributed to higher risk profiles in women. Both female gender and impaired myocardial reperfusion were independent predictors of 30-day outcomes after PPCI, emphasizing the importance of successful microvascular reperfusion in the women with STEMI."

We therefore examined potential sex differences in the effect of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) on recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a community-based study of survivors of a first acute myocardial infarction (MI).This report focuses on 1226 incident MI cases (28.4% women) discharged alive from area hospitals in the Western New York Acute MI Study (1996-2004). Deaths and underlying cause of death were determined via query of the National Death Index (Plus) Retrieval Program with follow-up through December 31, 2004. Outcomes reported included fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or coronary revascularization surgery and total stroke. Traditional CHD risk factors and other explanatory variables were determined by clinical examination after the first acute event. Impaired fasting glucose was defined as fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125mg/dl. During a mean follow-up of 4.5 years, there were 91 recurrent events (26.1%) in women and 173 recurrent events (19.7%) in men. After multivariable adjustment, the hazard ratios for recurrent cardiovascular events were 1.96 (95% CI: 1.15-3.16) and 2.59 (1.56-4.30) in women with IFG and with diabetes, respectively, compared to normoglycemic women. Among men, neither IFG nor diabetes was independently related to risk of recurrence.In this study, IFG was a strong risk factor for recurrent cardiovascular events only among women. These results suggest that increased cardiovascular risk in MI survivors begins at lower glucose levels in women than men."

Analyses were conducted using univariate and multivariate statistical techniques.In this study, 608 (39%) patients were women with mean age 62 ± 12 vs. 57 ± 13 years (p < 0.001). More women were seen in the older age groups (age <55 years: 25% vs. 43%, 55-74 years: 60% vs. 49% and >75 years: 15% vs. 8%; p < 0.001). Women had higher frequencies of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, angina, and aspirin use, but less history of smoking. Women were significantly less likely to have ischemic chest pain, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI and were more likely to have dyspnea, unstable angina, ST depression and left bundle branch block. Both groups received ACS medications and cardiac catheterization equally; however, women received anticoagulants (88% vs. 79%; p < 0.001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (70% vs. 65%; p = 0.050) more and clopidogrel less (20% vs. 29%; p < 0.001). Women experienced more recurrent ischemia and heart failure but with similar in-hospital mortality (4.6% vs. 4.3%) even after adjusting for age (p = 0.500).Women admitted with ACS were older than men, had more risk factors, presented differently with no difference in hospital mortality. This is similar to Gulf RACE study except for mortality. Women received anticoagulants/ACEIs /ARBs more but were under-treated with clopidogrel."

The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. Prognosis was assessed using Kaplan-Meier approach. Multivariable analyses assessing hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression models in two steps controlling for (i) the Ontario Acute Myocardial Infarction Mortality Prediction Rules (OAMIMPRs) and (ii) the OAMIMPR and additional potential confounders.Of 2669 subjects, 45.8% were elders, 66.2% male and 10.9% Bedouin. The mortality rate was 12.3% (young 4.6%, elders 22%). Survival was significantly lower in FB compared with MB in the elderly stratum (P = 0.025). Multivariate analyses demonstrated similar risks for dying among the young. In the elders, the first multivariate analysis showed greater risk for mortality in FB. Using FB as the reference group, the HRs were as follows: HR((MB)) = 0.36 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14-0.9]; HR((FJ)) = 0.5 (95% CI: 0.27-0.9) and HR((MJ)) = 0.5 (95% CI: 0.28-0.91). In the second analysis, the HRs were as follows: HR((MB)) = 0.37 (95% CI: 0.14-0.93); HR((FJ)) = 0.58 (95% CI: 0.32-1.07) and HR((MJ)) = 0.56 (95% CI: 0.31-1.03).Elderly FB have poor 1-year prognosis following AMI compared with MB, MJ and FJ when controlling for the OAMIMPR model, yet when controlling for other potential confounders the differences are of borderline significance in relation to Jewish subjects.

Having had a stroke before admission increased HF risk by 37%, diabetes increased the risk by 76% and atrial fibrillation by 80%. Patients with any kind of valvular disease had a more than doubled risk. Women had a 6% higher incidence of HF than men, whereas men with an index admission for AMI who did not develop HF had higher mortality than women.In this national sample, we observed a steady decrease in the risk of being hospitalized with HF after an AMI. However, the 3-year risk of HF remains high, with nearly one-third of AMI patients aged 65-84 developing HF within 3 years."

Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2011 Feb,,Mouse,,,"Contractile dysfunction is common to many forms of cardiovascular disease. Approaches directed at enhancing cardiac contractility at the level of the myofilaments during heart failure (HF) may provide a means to improve overall cardiovascular function. We are interested in gender-based differences in cardiac function and the effect of sarcomere activation agents that increase contractility. Thus, we studied the effect of gender and time on integrated arterial-ventricular function (A-V relationship) following myocardial infarction (MI). In addition, transgenic mice that overexpress the slow skeletal troponin I isoform were used to determine the impact of increased myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity following MI. Based on pressure-volume (P-V) loop measurements, we used derived parameters of cardiovascular function to reveal the effects of sex, time, and increased myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity among groups of post-MI mice. Analysis of the A-V relationship revealed that the initial increase was similar between the sexes, but the vascular unloading of the heart served to delay the decompensated stage in females. Conversely, the vascular response at 6 and 10 wk post-MI in males contributed to the continuous decline in cardiovascular function. Increasing the myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity appeared to provide sufficient contractile support to improve contractile function in both male and female transgenic mice. However, the improved contractile function was more beneficial in males as the concurrent vascular response contributed to a delayed decompensated stage in female transgenic mice post-MI. This study represents a quantitative approach to integrating the vascular-ventricular relationship to provide meaningful and diagnostic value following MI. Consequently, the data provide a basis for understanding how the A-V relationship is coupled between males and females and the enhanced ability of the cardiovascular system to tolerate pathophysiological stresses associated with HF in females."

At multivariable backward stepwise logistic regression analysis, the following variables were independent predictors for in-ICCU mortality in the overall population: age (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.05-1.27; p < 0.003), admission glycemia (OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.41-3.56; p < 0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.88-0.97; p < 0.001), primary PCI failure (OR 4.70; 95% CI 1.70-12.98; p < 0.003). In elderly STEMI patients submitted to primary PCI, early mortality can be related to age, hemodynamic derangement (as indicated by LVEF), the rate of procedural success, and increased glucose values. No gender-related differences in management were detectable in our series. Our data strongly suggest that, in elderly patients in the acute phase of STEMI, since hyperglycemia is a modifying factor, glucose values deserve a more intensive treatment. Further studies, performed specifically in elderly STEMI patients, should be addressed to identify the glucose cut-off values able to influence the outcome."

Type of performed research differed, especially in disease management, which received little attention (17%) in stroke, while representing the major focus in MI (40%). In both areas, clinical presentation received little attention (3 and 5%). Although publications progressively increased in both fields, an 8- to 10-year time gap emerged for stroke compared to MI. Last authors in both areas were predominantly men, but female last authorship is increasing more significantly over time in the field of stroke. Research on sex and gender differences in MI and stroke is largely underfunded, particularly by the EU.The data demonstrate how sex-/gender-specific research differs between specialties, most likely due to the diverse interest, funding opportunities and authorship distributions identified."

Patients were interviewed about the baseline characteristics as well as potential triggers of chest pain experienced over the day before the diagnosed onset of disease. The start of diagnostic chest pain was used as a marker of disease onset. The hazard period was defined as 12-h period of onset of chest pain.Among probable triggers, only unsuspected sudden bad news and sexual activity had significant relationships with chest pain appearance during the hazard period. Among patients with the experience of bad news, the risk of chest pain occurrence during the hazard period was 6.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-31.8]. Also, among those who were exposed to sexual activity, this risk was 3.4 (95% CI 1.1-10.4).

Results from the study will be used to develop clinically useful risk-stratification models for young AMI patients, explain sex differences in outcomes, and identify targets for intervention."

Estrogen is thought to be protective, but clinical trials with hormone replacement failed to show protection. Here, we sought to identify novel mechanisms that might explain this sex-based difference. By diverging from the traditional focus on sex hormones, we employed a conceptually novel approach to this question by using a non-biased approach to measure global changes in gene expression following infarction. We hypothesized that specific gene programs are initiated in the heart following infarction that might account for this sex-based difference. We induced small, medium, and large infarcts in male and female mice and measured changes in gene expression by microarray following infarction. Regardless of infarct size, survival was better in females, while mortality occurred 3-10 days following infarction in males. Two days following infarction, males developed significant ventricular dilation, the best predictor of mortality in humans. Three days following infarction, we measured gene expression by microarray, comparing male versus female and sham versus surgery/infarction. In general, our results indicate a higher relative level of gene induction in females versus males and identified programs for angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune response. This pattern of gene expression was linked to less pathologic remodeling in female hearts, including increased capillary density and decreased fibrosis. In summary, our results suggest an association between improved survival and less pathologic remodeling and the relative induction of gene expression in females following myocardial infarction."

However, long-term trends in extent of prehospital delay and factors affecting patient's care-seeking behavior remain relatively unexplored, especially in men and women of different ages. The objectives of this study were to examine the overall magnitude and 20-year trends (1986 to 2005) in duration of prehospital delay in middle-aged and elderly men and women hospitalized with AMI.The study sample consisted of 5967 residents of the Worcester, Mass, metropolitan area hospitalized at all greater Worcester medical centers for AMI between 1986 and 2005 who had information available about duration of prehospital delay. Compared with men <65 years, patients in other age-sex strata exhibited longer prehospital delays over the 20-year period under study. The multivariable-adjusted medians of prehospital delay were 1.96, 2.07, and 2.57 hours for men <65 years, men 65 to 74 years, and men ≥75 years and 2.08, 2.33, and 2.27 hours for women <65 years, women 65 to 74 years, and women ≥75 years, respectively. These age and sex differences have narrowed over time, which has been largely explained by changes in patient's comorbidity profile and AMI-associated characteristics.Our results suggest that duration of prehospital delay in persons with symptoms of AMI has remained essentially unchanged during the 20-year period under study and elderly individuals are more likely to delay seeking timely medical care than younger persons."

Indeed, experimental studies and post-mortem and observational clinical studies suggest the presence of important differences in myocardial remodeling between females and males in response to different types of injures including aging, pressure and volume overload, and myocardial infarction. Interestingly, the remodeling process appears to be more favorable in women versus men; women are more likely to present heart failure with preserved systolic function and are at greater risk for low output syndrome acutely. These differences between men and women are widely held to be related to sex hormones such as estrogen, although the molecular effects of estrogen on ventricular cardiomyocytes are incompletely understood.

We, therefore, examined the effect of PCI on long-term outcome between women and men.Between 1999 and 2001, 500 consecutive patients at the Wuppertal Heart Centre were treated with PCI after acute STEMI. A long-term follow-up (up to 7 years) was achieved in 97% of the patients.In comparison to men, women were 7 years older (65 +/- 12 vs. 58 +/- 11) and had significantly more diabetes mellitus. The time between onset of symptoms and intervention tended to be longer in women than men.

Stepwise regression analysis did not identify female gender as an independent predictor of late mortality. The quality of life was comparable.There was no gender-related difference in the long-term outcome if patients were sytematically treated with PCI in STEMI. PCI in STEMI has a long-lasting positive effect in women and should, therefore, be considered the treatment of choice for women with acute myocardial infarction."

Class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) act as key modulators of heart disease by repressing the activity of the myocyte enhancer factor (MEF)2 transcription factor, which promotes pathological cardiac remodeling in response to stress. Although it is proposed that HDACs additionally influence nuclear receptor signaling, the effect of class II HDACs on gender differences in cardiovascular disease remains unstudied.We aimed to examine the effect of class II HDACs on post-myocardial infarction remodeling in male and female mice.Here we show that the absence of HDAC5 or -9 in female mice protects against maladaptive remodeling following myocardial infarction, during which there is an upregulation of estrogen-responsive genes in the heart. This genetic reprogramming coincides with a pronounced increase in expression of the estrogen receptor (ER)alpha gene, which we show to be a direct MEF2 target gene. ERalpha also directly interacts with class II HDACs. Cardioprotection resulting from the absence of HDAC5 or -9 in female mice can be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced neoangiogenesis in the infarcted region via upregulation of the ER target gene vascular endothelial growth factor-a.Our results reveal a novel gender-specific pathway of cardioprotection mediated by ERalpha and its regulation by MEF2 and class II HDACs."

A total of 44 articles (42 studies) were included in the present analysis. The majority of studies showed that in patients hospitalized with AMI, women and older persons were more likely to arrive at the hospital later than men and younger persons. Several factors associated with duration of prehospital delay, including sociodemographic, medical history, clinical, and contextual characteristics differed according to sex.The elderly and women were more likely to exhibit longer delays in seeking medical care after the development of symptoms suggestive of AMI compared with other groups. Further research is needed to more fully understand the reasons for delay in these vulnerable groups."

Recent studies in animals have provided some insight to explain the molecular basis by which sex hormones may be responsible for the female predisposition to long QT syndromes as well as the higher male predisposition to lethal arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. Recently discovered preferential transmission of long QT syndrome alleles to daughters as compared with sons, as well as sex differences in the activity of membrane transporters and in recently discovered myocardial cytochrome P450 enzymes, may explain the predisposition of women to acquired and drug-induced long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes. Important sex differences in the use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy have also been reported. Women appear to be underrepresented among patients who receive implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices.

After a median follow-up of 18 months, women showed an unadjusted higher risk of death (p=0.040), cardiac death (p=0.033), and the death/myocardial infarction (p=0.012). However, after multivariable adjustment, gender was no longer an independent predictor of death (hazard ratio=1.119 [0.804-1.558]), cardiac death (hazard ratio=1.045 [0.697-1.567]), or death/myocardial infarction (hazard ratio=0.531 [0.192-1.465]), given the predominant role of age, diabetes and EuroSCORE as independent predictors and confounders of the gender-based comparison.Women undergoing PCI for ULM present more often with an acute coronary syndrome, are treated less frequently with DES, and have more adverse events, but these gender biases are not confirmed after adjusting for confounders. Thus, stent-based PCI for ULM offers similarly favourable clinical results in women as well as in men."

One explanation may be that they tend to be treated less aggressively than men even when more aggressive treatment is warranted. The purpose of this analysis was to assess this issue.We used the Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes with Early Implementation (CRUSADE) Quality Improvement Initiative registry, an observational data collection that began in November 2001, with retrospective data collection from January 2001 to December 2006. A total of 32,888 subjects met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for our study, based on strong biochemical evidence of myocardial infarction and acute onset of typical cardiac chest pain. We stratified subjects into 16 cells for coronary intervention, based on 4 age groups and 4 cardiac catheterization findings (insignificant, 1-vessel disease, 2-vessel disease, 3-vessel disease). We also stratified subjects into 20 cells for medical treatment, based on 4 age groups and 5 medical treatments. In each cell we compared the rate of coronary intervention (coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention) or medical treatment (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blocker, and statins) for men vs women.Men demonstrated significantly higher rates (P < 0.05) of coronary intervention in 7 of the 16 cells and 9 of the 20 medical treatment cells, compared to no cells in which women had statistically higher rates than men.These findings suggest that men are more likely than women to receive coronary intervention and to be medically treated when presenting with evidence of non-ST-segment myocardial infarction, controlled for age, cardiac catheterization findings, and biochemical evidence of myocardial infarction."

The study was based on 505 men and 196 women with DM and 1,327 men and 415 women without DM consecutively hospitalized with a first-ever AMI from January 1998 to December 2003 recruited from a population-based MI registry. Patients were followed until December 31, 2005 (median follow-up time 4.3 years). In men and women, no significantly independent association between DM and short-term mortality was observed. After multivariable adjustment odds ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for 28-day case fatality were 1.45 (95% CI 0.90 to 2.34) in men with DM compared to men without DM and 1.44 (95% CI 0.66 to 3.15) in women with DM compared to women without DM. Conversely, in 28-day AMI survivors DM was significantly associated with long-term mortality in age-adjusted analyses, in which men with DM had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.57 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.10) for all-cause mortality compared to non-DM men; the corresponding HR in women with DM was 2.91 (95% CI 1.82 to 4.65). After multivariable adjustment the strong association in women with DM remained significant (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.27); however, in men with DM it became borderline significant (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.85). In conclusion, short-term mortality was not significantly increased in men and women with DM after a first-ever AMI, although estimates were relatively high, indicating a possible relation. However, long-term mortality was higher in patients with AMI and DM, particularly in women."

Sex steroids also play a crucial role in the occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), which is considered to be gender dependent and related to testosterone. Additionally, first-trimester exposure to excess levels of estrogens and progesterone has been linked to cardiovascular anomalies.The aim of this work was to study digit ratios in a Greek population and assess their clinical importance as markers of predisposition to MI.Two samples were used: a group of Greek men and women hospitalized with MI, and a control group of healthy Greek men and women of the same age. Finger lengths were measured twice for both hands using electronic calipers. In the results, digits were designated as 2D (second digit), 3D (third digit), 4D (fourth digit), and 5D (fifth digit).A total of 50 Greek men and 50 Greek women with MI were recruited (mean [SD] age, 69.3 [11.2] years for men; 69.7 [11.0] years for women). The control group consisted of 40 healthy Greek men and 40 healthy Greek women (mean age, 68.0 [11.8] years for men; 66.8 [10.7] years for women). In the control group, 2D:4D, 2D:3D, and 2D:5D ratios were significantly higher in women than in men (2D:4D: right hand, P < 0.001; left hand, P = 0.002; 2D:3D: right hand, P < 0.001; left hand, P = 0.003; 2D:5D: right hand, P < 0.001; left hand, P < 0.05). The mean values of 2D:4D ratios appeared to increase in the following order: healthy men < men with MI < healthy women < women with MI, although this difference was not statistically significant. In men with MI, 2D:4D and 3D:4D ratios were significantly higher than the respective ratios in healthy men (2D:4D: right hand, P = 0.001; left hand, P < 0.05; 3D:4D: right hand, P < 0.05; left hand, P = 0.001), but no significant differences were observed in the ratios between women with MI and healthy women.Digit ratios that include ring-finger length (ie, 4D) may be useful biomarkers for predisposition to MI in Greek men, but not in Greek women. Sexual dimorphism of digit ratios was present in both groups and was independent of the individuals' health status."

On ne sait pas si ces différences persistent. OBJECTIFS : Examiner les tendances dans le temps et les différences selon les sexes du cathétérisme coronarien et de la revascularisation après un infarctus aigu du myocarde (IAM). MÉTHODOLOGIE : Les chercheurs ont procédé à une analyse rétrospective de tous les patients de 20 ans ou plus hospitalisés en Colombie-Britannique en raison d'un IAM entre le 1 avril 1994 et le 31 mars 2003. L'analyse de régression segmentée a permis d'examiner le point d'inflexion de la tendance dans le temps des taux de cathétérisme 90 jours après un IAM. Le modèle de régression de Cox multivariable a permis d'évaluer les différences d'administration de cathétérisme et de revascularisation selon les sexes après un IAM. RÉSULTATS : Les taux de cathétérismes coronaires au bout de 90 jours ont considérablement augmenté pendant la période de l'étude, tant chez les hommes que chez les femmes (P<0,0001 en matière de tendance), l'augmentation étant plus marquée à compter de septembre 2000. Les femmes étaient moins susceptibles de subir un cathétérisme que les hommes, même après rajustement des différences de départ. Cet effet attribuable au sexe changeait selon l'âge et les soins à l'unité de soins intensifs ou de soins cardiaques (USI-USC). Notamment, l'hospitalisation à l'USI-USC éliminait la différence selon les sexes chez les patients de moins de 65 ans. Sous réserve d'avoir reçu un cathétérisme cardiaque après l'IAM, le sexe féminin ne s'associait pas à une diminution de la probabilité d'avoir reçu une revascularisation au bout d'un an (FC 0,96; 95 % IC 0,91 à 1,02). CONCLUSIONS : Malgré l'augmentation récente du taux de cathétérisme après un IAM, les femmes étaient moins susceptibles de subir un cathétérisme que les hommes. Fait intéressant, l'accès à l'USI-USC faisait disparaître la différence d'accès au cathétérisme chez les patients de moins de 65 ans.Studies before the turn of the century reported sex differences in procedure rates. It is unknown whether these differences persist.To examine time trends and sex differences in coronary catheterization and revascularization following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients 20 years of age or older who were admitted to hospital in British Columbia with an AMI between April 1, 1994, and March 31, 2003. Segmented regression analysis was used to examine the inflection point of the time trend in 90-day catheterization rates post-AMI. Multivariable Cox regression modelling was used to evaluate sex differences in receiving catheterization and revascularization following AMI.Ninety-day coronary catheterization rates increased significantly over the study period for both men and women (P<0.0001 for trend), with a steeper increase beginning in September 2000. Women were less likely to undergo catheterization than men, even after adjustment for baseline differences; this sex effect was modified by age and care in the intensive care unit or cardiac care unit (ICU⁄CCU). Specifically, ICU⁄CCU admission eliminated the sex difference among patients who were younger than 65 years of age. Conditional on receiving cardiac catheterization post-AMI, female sex was not associated with a lower likelihood of receiving revascularization within one year (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02).Despite recent increases in catheterization rates post-AMI, women were less likely to undergo catheterization than men. Interestingly, access to ICU⁄CCU care removed the sex difference in catheterization access in patients younger than 65 years of age."

The primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction or stroke at 180 days. The secondary outcomes were death, myocardial infarction, refractory ischemia, stroke or revascularization at 180 days.Among 815 patients (545 males, 270 females), the incidences of primary and secondary outcome were equivalent for both genders (P > 0.05). Males of the early intervention group had a greater incidence of the primary outcome (7.1% vs 14.8%, P = 0.00). The secondary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction or refractory ischemia occurring in 12.5% of males in early intervention group and 21.2% in delayed intervention group.

However, others have reported no significant differences after controlling for age, resulting in uncertainty about the existence of a true gender bias in cardiac care. In this study, a population-based cohort approach was used to calculate age-specific procedure rates by sex from administrative data. Chi-square tests and generalized linear modelling were used to assess gender differences and interactions. For all four procedures studied, rates were significantly higher for males than females (p<0.01). However, age-specific rates revealed few significant differences by gender and a sharp decrease in intervention rates with age for both males and females. Generalized linear modelling confirmed that patient age was a significant predictor of intervention rates, whereas sex was not. The significant gender difference in overall rates was completely confounded by the older age profile of female AMI patients compared to their male counterparts."

Use of ICDs for primary prevention in patients with myocardial infarction (2002-2007) or heart failure (2005-2007) also was examined.Among 9,246 eligible secondary prevention patients (age 66.3 +/- 14.3 years; 3,577 women [39%]) with cardiac arrest, men were more likely to undergo ICD implantation, with an age-, comorbidity-, and arrhythmia-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.66-2.23). Among 105,516 patients with myocardial infarction (age 68.3 +/- 12.7 years; 42,987 women [41%]), men were threefold more likely to undergo ICD implantation, with an adjusted HR of 3.00 (95% CI: 2.53-3.55). Among 61,160 patients with heart failure (age 76.2 +/- 12.0 years; 31,575 women [52%]), ICD implantation was more likely in men, with an adjusted HR of 3.01 (95% CI: 2.59-3.50). The odds of ICD implant for secondary prevention increased over time by 21% (95% CI: 13%-30%) in women and by 6% (95% CI: 2%-11%) in men, but rates of ICD use in men for primary prevention indications were persistently higher.Men were more likely to undergo defibrillator implant than were women for primary and secondary prevention.

Depression is, in part, genetically determined and inflammation has been implicated. Women are twice as likely to develop depression as men.We examined the association, separately in men and women, between seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP) gene and 12 SNPs in the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) gene and depression in 1368 white subjects (30.4% female) referred for cardiovascular evaluation. Depression was defined as a score of >or=10 in the Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Single marker analysis was assessed by the chi(2) test. Haplotype-specific associations were performed, using likelihood ratio tests. Empirical significance levels were determined by permutation tests.Depressed individuals, comprising 14.5% of the total, were more likely to be female, current smokers, have a history of diabetes and myocardial infarction. None of the SNPs in the ALOX5AP gene, either singly or in combination, was associated with depression. The 12 SNPs in the LTA4H gene were not individually associated with depression. However, a six-SNP haplotype in LTA4H gene, named HapE, showed a significant protective effect on depression in women, but not in men, after correcting for cardiovascular effects. The interaction between HapE and sex on depression was statistically significant.This study provides the first evidence for a sex-specific association of a novel haplotype in the LTA4H gene on depression. Although replication is needed, our study suggests that genetic variations may underlie sex differences in depression."
19546346,Yes," Bohuslav Ostadal,",Gender differences in cardiac ischemic injury and protection--experimental aspects.,"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",2009 Sep,Review,Mouse,,,"This review summarizes some available information on gender differences of myocardial injury with particular attention to experimental approach. It has been observed that significant gender differences exist already in normal heart. They involve among others cardiac growth, contractile function, calcium metabolism and function of mitochondria. Differences, characteristic of the normal myocardium, generate the logical presumption of the different reaction of the male and female heart to various pathogenic factors. Most of the experimental studies confirm the clinical observations: increased resistance of the female heart to ischemia/reperfusion injury was shown in dogs, rats, mice and rabbits. Furthermore, gender differences in the ischemic tolerance of the adult myocardium can be influenced by interventions (e.g. hypoxia) imposed during the early phases of ontogenetic development. The already high tolerance of the adult female heart can be increased by adaptation to chronic hypoxia and ischemic preconditioning. It seems that the protective effect depends on age: it was absent in young, highly tolerant heart but it appeared with the decrease of natural resistance during aging. Both experimental and clinical studies have indicated that female gender influences favorably also the remodeling and the adaptive response to myocardial infarction. It follows from the data available that male and female heart differs significantly in many parameters under both physiological and pathological conditions. Detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms of these differences are still unknown; they involve genomic and non-genomic effects of sex steroid hormones, particularly the most frequently studied estrogens. The cardiovascular system is, however, influenced not only by estrogens but also by other sex hormones, e.g. androgens. Moreover, steroid hormone receptors do not act alone but interact with a broad array of co-regulatory proteins to alter transcription. The differences are so important that they deserve serious consideration in clinical practice in search for proper diagnostic and therapeutic procedures."

INTERGENE was a population-based research program on risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Medical charts were reviewed for each patient to determine the symptoms of AMI, and the prevalence of each symptom was compared according to sex.The study included 225 patients with a first AMI: 52 women and 173 men. Chest pain was the most common symptom, affecting 88.5% (46/52) of the women and 94.8% (164/173) of the men, with no statistically significant difference between the sexes. Women had significantly higher rates of 4 symptoms: nausea (53.8% [28/52] vs 29.5% [51/173]; age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.78; 95% CI, 1.47-5.25), back pain (42.3% [22/52] vs 14.5% [25/173]; OR = 4.29; 95% CI, 2.14-8.62), dizziness (17.3% [9/52] vs 7.5% [13/173]; OR = 2.60; 95% CI, 1.04-6.50), and palpitations (11.5% [6/52] vs 2.9% [5/173]; OR = 3.99; 95% CI, 1.15-13.84). No significant gender differences were found in the proportions of patients experiencing arm or shoulder pain, diaphoresis, dyspnea, fatigue, neck pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, jaw pain, or syncope/lightheadedness. No significant differences were found in the duration, type, or location of chest pain. The medical charts listed numerically more symptoms in women than in men; 73.1% (38/52) of the women but only 48.0% (83/173) of the men reported >3 symptoms (age-adjusted OR = 3.26; 95% CI, 1.62-6.54).Chest pain is the most common presenting symptom in both women and men with AMI.

Another aim was to determine whether these early warning signs had any influence on the patients' acute symptoms of AMI.This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study of Norwegian patients (aged <or=75 years) hospitalized with their first AMI. A self-administered questionnaire was used to gather information on prodromal symptoms, defined as pain in the chest, pain in the shoulder or back, radiating pain or numbness in the arms, dyspnea, and fatigue. Symptoms were reported for the year before AMI and during the acute stage. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between prodromal symptoms and acute symptoms and the effect of medical history (hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia).The self-administered questionnaire had a 72% response rate; the study included 149 women and 384 men diagnosed with first-time AMI. Symptoms occurring during the year before AMI included pain in the chest in 45% (240/533), shoulder or back pain in 51% (270/533), arm pain in 38% (205/533), dyspnea in 33% (176/533), and fatigue in 62% (330/533). There were no statistically significant gender differences. The risk of experiencing chest symptoms in the acute phase was >5 times higher in women who had experienced prodromal symptoms in the chest (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.11; 95% CI, 1.38-18.88) and nearly 3 times higher in men (OR = 2.80; 95% CI, 1.17-6.70). The risk of experiencing shoulder or back pain was almost 5 times higher in men with prodromal shoulder or back pain (OR = 4.96; 95% CI, 3.01-8.19), but no statistically significant association was found in women. The risk of experiencing radiating arm pain or numbness in the acute phase was more than doubled in women with prodromal arm pain (OR = 2.68; 95% CI, 1.19-6.20) and more than tripled in men with prodromal arm pain (OR = 3.11; 95% CI, 1.90-5.07). The risk of experiencing dyspnea in the acute phase was more than doubled in women with prodromal dyspnea (OR = 2.67; 95% CI, 1.25-5.71) and >5 times higher in men with prodromal dyspnea (OR = 5.73; 95% CI, 3.42-9.62).

Hypertensive women, but not men, were less likely to experience chest symptoms in the acute phase (OR = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.82).Almost half of the study patients (45%) experienced prodromal chest symptoms the year before their first AMI. These prodromal symptoms predicted the symptoms that occurred during the acute stage of AMI, with some differences between the sexes."

Serum concentrations of progesterone, estradiol, C-reactive protein (CRP), and urea were measured at baseline (1996) and at 8-year follow-up (2004), and serum concentrations of cystatin and insulin were measured only at follow-up. The outcomes of interest were cardiovascular morbidity (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, congestive heart failure [CHF], cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, and thromboembolism), diabetes, and mortality throughout the observation period.At baseline, the study sample included 230 men and 195 women (mean [SD] age, 74.6 [2.6] years). At follow-up, 132 men and 145 women (mean age, 82.4 [2.5] years) met the inclusion criteria, of whom 128 men and 112 women did so at both baseline and follow-up. Serum progesterone concentrations, which did not differ significantly from reported concentrations for the age group, were significantly associated with mortality across the observation period (P < 0.001). At follow-up, higher serum progesterone was significantly associated with the occurrence of CHF (P < 0.01); this association remained robust after adjustment for CRP, cystatin, and insulin levels.In these elderly Swedish men and women, increased physiologic concentrations of progesterone were found to be associated with an increased prevalence of CHF, independent of inflammatory factors, markers of renal function, and insulin metabolism."

We examined whether such mortality differences have decreased in recent years.We investigated temporal trends in the hospital case-fatality rates of MI by sex and age from June 1, 1994, through December 31, 2006. The study population included 916,380 patients from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction with a confirmed diagnosis of MI.In-hospital mortality decreased markedly between 1994 and 2006 in all patients but more so in women than men. The mortality reduction in 2006 relative to 1994 was largest in women younger than 55 years (52.9%) and lowest in men younger than 55 years (33.3%). In patients younger than 55 years, the absolute decrease in mortality was 3 times larger in women than men (2.7% vs 0.9%). As a result, the excess mortality in younger women (<55 years) compared with men was less pronounced in 2004-2006 (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.67) than it was in 1994-1995 (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-2.24). The sex difference in mortality decrease was lower in older patients (P = .004 for the interaction among sex, age, and year). Changes in comorbidity and clinical severity features at admission accounted for more than 90% of these mortality trends.In recent years, women, particularly younger ones, experienced larger improvements in hospital mortality after MI than men. The narrowing of the mortality gap between younger women and men is largely attributable to temporal changes in risk profiles."
19833255,Yes," Leslee J Shaw,",Women and ischemic heart disease: evolving knowledge.,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2009 Oct 20,Review,Human,,,"Evolving knowledge regarding sex differences in coronary heart disease is emerging. Given the lower burden of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and preserved systolic function in women, which contrasts with greater rates of myocardial ischemia and near-term mortality compared with men, we propose the term ""ischemic heart disease"" as appropriate for this discussion specific to women rather than CAD or coronary heart disease (CHD). This paradoxical difference, where women have lower rates of anatomical CAD but more symptoms, ischemia, and adverse outcomes, appears linked to abnormal coronary reactivity that includes microvascular dysfunction. Novel risk factors can improve the Framingham risk score, including inflammatory markers and reproductive hormones, as well as noninvasive imaging and functional capacity measurements. Risk for women with obstructive CAD is increased compared with men, yet women are less likely to receive guideline-indicated therapies. In the setting of non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, interventional strategies are equally effective in biomarker-positive women and men, whereas conservative management is indicated for biomarker-negative women. For women with evidence of ischemia but no obstructive CAD, antianginal and anti-ischemic therapies can improve symptoms, endothelial function, and quality of life; however, trials evaluating impact on adverse outcomes are needed. We hypothesize that women experience more adverse outcomes compared with men because obstructive CAD remains the current focus of therapeutic strategies. Continued research is indicated to devise therapeutic regimens to improve symptom burden and reduce risk in women with ischemic heart disease."

Over a 6-month period in 2007, 8,169 consecutive patients (74% men, 24% women) presenting with acute coronary syndromes were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter study from 6 adjacent Middle Eastern countries. Women were 9 years older than men and more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Women were more likely to present with unstable angina and more often had atypical presentations of ST elevation myocardial infarction. Compared to men, women were significantly less treated with beta blockers and antiplatelet therapy, whereas reperfusion therapy was nonsignificantly less used in women. In all patients with acute coronary syndromes, women not only ranked higher on Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score but also had increased in-hospital mortality, 1.75 times that of men. This mortality difference persisted after adjusting for all confounders (odds ratios 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8, p <0.01). In conclusion, in addition to presentation with higher risk factors, female gender also independently predicted poorer outcomes in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction."

All cases meeting criteria for SCA were ascertained using multiple sources. Medical records were reviewed to identify clinical conditions that may contribute to SCA risk, and comparisons were made between male and female SCA cases using Pearson's chi-square tests for categorical variables, t tests for continuous variables, and multivariate logistic regression analysis.During 2002 to 2007, 1,568 adult SCA cases were identified (women 36% vs. men 64%; p < 0.0001) and women were older (mean age 71 +/- 14 years vs. 65 +/- 14 years, p < 0.0001).

The data were obtained from the CHECKMATE study. It included 924 patients with possible myocardial ischemia excluding subjects with ST-segment elevation. The Dade-Behring Stratus CS STAT near-patient instrument (Dade Behring, Inc, Newark, Del) was used to measure cTnI. We assessed baseline troponin accuracy using a standard MI definition. There were 125 subjects with a definite MI diagnosis. Baseline troponin was 44% sensitive and 97% specific in predicting MI, with no significant gender differences. In contrast, other positive cardiac markers, namely rising or falling creatine-kinase MB fraction and positive electrocardiogram, occurred more frequently in men. Sensitivity (SE) of baseline troponin was higher in subjects where baseline troponin was obtained longer than 2 hours after the chest pain onset. The study did not observe a significant difference in the assay SE or specificity by gender. This observation, plus the fact that other positive cardiac markers occurred more frequently in men, suggest the troponin test may help to improve the diagnosis of MI in women."

Re-infarction or stroke within 30 days were rare for both genders without gender-specific differences whereas bleeding necessitating blood replacement was significantly more frequent in women (16.8% vs. 5.9%, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, female gender was not independently associated with a higher risk of 30-day mortality (OR 0.964, P = 0.93).Women underwent PCI therapy for STEMI with the same frequency and the same angiographic success as men. Despite their more advanced age and the higher prevalence of co-morbidities, they did not have a significantly higher 30-day mortality rate than men. Female gender was not an independent risk factor of 30-day mortality. Longer pre-hospital delays before hospital admission in women indicate that awareness of risk from coronary artery disease should be further raised in women."

Gender-related differences have been found in the presentation, prevalence, and clinical outcomes of CAD in many studies. Compared to women, men present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction more often and have a higher prevalence of CAD. These findings indicate that gender may have an important influence on CAD. Appropriate diagnosis, prevention, recent patent inventions, and treatment will improve the care of all patients. It is therefore necessary to consider the differences in the features of ischemic heart disease between men and women when examining patients. Novel drugs for tailor-made therapy based on gender differences should be developed for the treatment of CAD in future."

The dependent variable was medical diagnosis reporting of diabetes, hypertension and myocardial infarct or stroke. Respondents were grouped into three categories: no disease; one chronic disease; and two or more. The associations between the dependent variable and sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral risk factors (smoking, consumption of fatty meat and whole milk, leisure-time physical inactivity, low fruit and vegetable intake and intake of added salt) and self-perceived health status were assessed in men and women using multinomial logistic regression.Chronic disease reporting was higher among older men and women with lower schooling, BMI > or = 30 kg/m2 and who were on a diet. There was an inverse association between number of risk behaviors and two or more chronic diseases (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54;0.76 among men and OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77;0.97 among women). Those men (OR: 33.61; 95% CI: 15.70;71.93) and women (OR: 13.02; 95% CI: 6.86; 24.73) who self-perceived their health as poor reported more chronic diseases. There was no statistical interaction between self-perceived health status and gender.An inverse association between number of risk behaviors and reporting of two or more chronic diseases suggests a reverse causality and/or higher survival rates among those who take better care of themselves. Men seem to have poorer perception of their health status compared to women, after adjustment for confounders."

The number of men and women undergoing surgical treatment was extracted and the male-female odds ratios calculated. Several risk factors and a risk adjustment technique (APR-DRG) were used to control for possible confounders. Backward stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for significant covariates.Crude analysis demonstrated that gender is a discriminating factor in the probability of surgery (OR 2.11, 95% CI 2.04 to 2.19), with similar findings among those with each main diagnosis. The odds ratios decreased after adjustment for age, co-morbidity and disease severity but remained significant.Men and women admitted to hospitals in a region of northern Italy with a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease are treated differently and this cannot be explained by age or severity of disease."

However, women have lower sympathetic output than men. We therefore examined matched groups of F-AMI (18) and M-AMI (18) patients 2-4 days following uncomplicated AMI, then 3 monthly to 9 months; matched normal control (NC) groups comprised M-NC (18) and F-NC (18). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was measured by microneurography. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was lower in the F-NC than M-NC (at least P < 0.05) and greater in the two AMI groups than their corresponding NC groups (at least P < 0.001). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was similar in the F-AMI and M-AMI groups indicating a post-AMI increase in women of about twice that in men (P < 0.0001).

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explicate the decision-making processes of ED nurses who triage men and women for MI.A qualitative, descriptive study was conducted using focus group methodology. A synthesized conceptual model was used to guide focus group discussions and to begin the process of developing a conceptually based, quantifiable measure of ED nurses' cardiac triage decisions. Participants' (N = 12) oral descriptions were audiotape recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the Krueger content analysis method.When making MI triage decisions and determining triage urgency status, ED nurses determine the underlying cause of patients' chief complaints based on clinical presentation, patient demographics, past medical history, as well as their own attitudes, perceptions and beliefs, nursing knowledge, and ED experience. Important patient cues include general appearance, vital signs, cardiac history, chest pain, and mode of transportation. Nurse's ultimate goal when making cardiac triage decisions is to have the patient receive a prompt electrocardiogram and prompt medical evaluation and to advocate for the patient.Nurses are knowledgeable of age and sex differences in MI presentation. However, some nurses hold cultural biases and stereotypes that may interfere with the timely delivery of emergency cardiac healthcare. Findings from this study will be used to develop a quantifiable measure of ED nurses' cardiac triage decision-making processes."

Clinical and angiographic characteristics, procedural and treatment patterns, and in-hospital outcomes were examined.Women presented more often with UA/NSTEMI than men (82% of women vs 77% of men, P < .0001). Despite having greater comorbidities, women in both ACS categories had fewer high risk angiographic features than men. Women were less likely to receive aspirin or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and were less often discharged on aspirin or statin. For in-hospital mortality, the adjusted odds ratio for men compared to women was similar (odds ratio 0.97, P = .5). Women had higher rates of cardiogenic shock, congestive heart failure, any bleeding, and any vascular complications. Importantly, rates of subacute stent thrombosis were less in women compared to men (0.43% vs 0.57%, P = .0003).Although women had fewer high-risk angiographic features than men, they continue to have higher rates of in-hospital complications. This suggests the need for gender-tailored techniques to minimize post-intervention complications and maximize application of evidence-based antiplatelet therapies."

Depressive symptoms predict adverse post-MI outcomes and are more prevalent among women than men. We examined whether depressive symptoms contribute to women's worse outcomes after MI.In a prospective multicenter study (PREMIER), 2411 (807 women) MI patients were enrolled. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire. Outcomes included 1-year rehospitalization, presence of angina using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, and 2-year mortality. Multivariable analyses were used to evaluate the association between sex and these outcomes, adjusting for clinical characteristics. The depressive symptoms score was added to the models to evaluate whether it attenuated the association between sex and outcomes. Depressive symptoms were more prevalent in women compared with men (29% versus 18.8%, P<0.001). After adjusting for demographic factors, comorbidities, and MI severity, women had a mildly higher risk of rehospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.40), angina (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.75), and mortality (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.64). After adding depressive symptoms to the multivariable models, the relationship further declined toward the null, particularly for rehospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.34) and angina (odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.63), whereas there was little change in the estimate for mortality (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.62). Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with each of the study outcomes with a similar magnitude of effect in both women and men.A higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in women modestly contributes to their higher rates of rehospitalization and angina compared with men but not mortality after MI. Our results support the recent recommendations of improving recognition of depressive symptoms after MI."

It is controversial whether these cell types are able to form novel functional myocardium. Alternatively, graft-related or immune-related paracrine mechanisms may preserve existing myocardium, improve neovascularisation, affect tissue remodelling or induce endogenous de novo formation of functional myocardium. We have applied an alternative somatic cell type, human cord-blood-derived unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs) in a porcine model of acute MI.USSCs were transplanted into the acutely ischaemic lateral wall of the left ventricle (LV). LV dimension and function were assessed by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) pre-MI, immediately post-MI, 48 hours and 8 weeks after USSC injection. Additionally, apoptosis, mitosis and recruitment of macrophages were examined 48 hours post-engraftment.Gender-specific and species-specific FISH/immunostaining failed to detect engrafted donor cells 8 weeks post-MI. Nevertheless, cell treatment effectively preserved natural myocardial architecture. Global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before MI was 60% (7%). Post-MI, LVEF decreased to 34% (8%). After 8 weeks, LVEF had further decreased to 27% (6%) in the control group and recovered to 52% (2%) in the USSC group (p<0.01). Left-ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) before MI was 28 (2) ml. 8 weeks post-MI, LVEDV had increased to 77 (4) ml in the control group. No LV dilation was detected in the USSC group (LVEDV: 26 (2) ml, p<0.01). Neither apoptosis nor recruitment of macrophages and mitosis were different in either groups.Transplantation of USSCs significantly improved LV function and prevented scar formation as well as LV dilation. Since differentiation, apoptosis and macrophage mobilisation at infarct site were excluded as underlying mechanisms, paracrine effects are most likely to account for the observed effects of USSC treatment."

However, available family risk scores do not reflect the age of disease onset, gender and family structures simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for a family risk score, the stratified log-rank family score (SLFS), which incorporates the age of disease onset of family members, gender differences and the relationship among family members. Via simulation, we demonstrate that the new SLFS is more closely associated with the true family risk for the disease and more robust to family sizes than two existing methods. We apply our proposed method and the two existing methods to a study of stroke and heart disease. The results show that assessing family history can improve the prediction of disease risks and the SLFS has strongest positive associations with both myocardial infarction and stroke."

Mean age within the various groups was: women nonsmokers 80.7 years, women smokers 66.2 years, difference 14.4 years (P<0.001); men nonsmokers 72.2 years, men smokers 63.9 years, difference 8.3 years (P<0.001). After adjustment for risk factors (hypertension, cholesterol levels, diabetes) and patient characteristics (history of angina, history of stroke) 13.7 years of the age difference in women were attributed to smoking; the corresponding figure in men was 6.2 years (P<0.001).First AMI occurred significantly more prematurely in women than in men smokers, implying that twice as many years were lost by women as by men smokers."
19452405,Yes," Christine S Zuern,",Platelet function and response to aspirin: gender-specific features and implications for female thrombotic risk and management.,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2009 Apr,Review,Human,,,"This article reviews gender-specific differences in platelet function and response to aspirin. In contrast with men, women under 65 years of age do not benefit from aspirin therapy in primary prevention of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the overall mortality after myocardial infarction is higher among women, which cannot simply be explained by age or individual treatment. Platelets play a central role in thrombo-ischemic events leading to myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Gender differences in platelet reactivity and ""aspirin resistance"" have been reported. Several studies using female platelets have shown increased platelet reactivity at baseline and a less effective inhibition of platelet aggregation by aspirin. The mechanisms underlying these differences are still to be elucidated, but influences of female sex hormones may play an important role. As a consequence, inhibition of platelet aggregation in women treated with aspirin may be insufficient, and female patients might benefit from higher maintenance dosages or the use of alternative antiplatelet medications. A potential future role of pharmacogenomics and laboratory monitoring of antiplatelet medications in predicting individual responsiveness is likely. Overall, primary prevention of myocardial infarction in women should be correlated with the individual risk score of the female patient. More studies focused on women are needed to optimize gender-specific therapy and, therefore, to improve clinical outcomes in women with atherosclerosis."

We searched the English-language literature indexed in MEDLINE, Scopus and EBSCOhost Research databases from 1988 through January 2009 using the indexing terms 'gender', 'short- and long-term outcomes' and 'acute coronary syndrome' and 'myocardial infarction'. Data comparing gender differences in outcomes after ACS showed that females have a higher mortality rate than males. Observational studies showed that guideline-recommended management strategies are used significantly less frequently in females than males. The undertreatment and worse outcome of female patients with ACS are probably multifactorial and have been reported in different ethnicities and cultures. However, there are conflicting data regarding to the impact of gender on early versus long-term outcomes, the benefit of early intervention in low- and high-risk females and the influence of unmeasured selection biases in the use of therapies in the observational data. These gender discrepancy trends warrant close follow-up, as this might reflect changes in primary and secondary prevention in the community. Furthermore, gender discrepancy gives an indication of healthcare quality and whether care is given in an unbiased manner. All high-risk females, and males with ACS, should receive optimal medical management, coronary angiography and revascularization whenever indicated."

A convenience sample of Jordanians with AMI were interviewed at the coronary care units of two teaching hospitals in Jordan.The Arabic version of the modified Response to Symptom Questionnaire was used to assess predictors of decision delay and patterns of health care-seeking behaviors. Decision delay was evaluated by assisting patients to triangulate time of symptom onset and time of decision to seek professional health care by placing both times in context of daily activities that participants could easily remember. Regression analysis was conducted to elicit predictors of decision delay.Decision delay time among Jordanian men (n=110) and women (n=24) with AMI was alarmingly long (medians 3.5 and 3.6 hours, respectively). Variables that correspondingly predicted decision delay among men and women were age, waiting for symptoms to go away, anxiety due to symptom presentation, and others' responses to patients' symptoms. While 16 other variables (cognitive, emotional, and clinical) independently predicted delay among men, equivalent evidence was not established among women due to the relatively small sample size.Similarities and differences existed between Jordanian men's and women's decision delay to seek health care for AMI. Decision delay time among Jordanians with AMI requires intervention that incorporates awareness of delay predictors. Future research needs to utilize adequate sample sizes of both sexes to obtain a better understanding of sex differences.To reduce decision delay among Jordanians, health educators should emphasize early symptom recognition and the value of prompt health care-seeking behaviors."

Male sex was associated with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 2.01, 95% confidence interval 1.35 to 2.97), death from ischaemic heart disease (2.80, 1.73 to 4.53), and all cause mortality (1.82, 1.33 to 2.49). Increasing age was associated with acute myocardial infarction (1.04, 1.02 to 1.06, per year of age increase), death from ischaemic heart disease (1.09, 1.06 to 1.11, per year of age increase), and all cause mortality (1.09, 1.07 to 1.11, per year of age increase). Smoking was associated with subsequent acute myocardial infarction (1.94, 1.31 to 2.89), death from ischaemic heart disease (2.12, 1.32 to 3.39), and all cause mortality (2.11, 1.52 to 2.95). Obesity was associated with death from ischaemic heart disease (2.01, 1.17 to 3.45) and all cause mortality (2.20, 1.52 to 3.19). Previous stroke was associated with all cause mortality (1.78, 1.13 to 2.80) and chronic kidney disease with death from ischaemic heart disease (5.72, 1.74 to 18.79).

Acute myocardial infarction after a diagnosis of angina was associated with an increased risk of death from ischaemic heart disease and all cause mortality (8.84 (5.31 to 14.71) and 4.23 (2.78 to 6.43), respectively). Neither of the invasive cardiac procedures significantly reduced the subsequent risk of all cause mortality.In this sample of people with incident angina from primary care, there were sex differences in survival and age and sex differences in the provision of revascularisation after a diagnosis. Acute myocardial infarction after a diagnosis of angina was strongly predictive of mortality. To minimise adverse outcomes, optimal preventive treatments should be used in patients with angina."

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the therapeutic capacity of MDSCs transplanted into myocardium is influenced by sex of donor MDSCs or recipient. Male and female MDSCs isolated from the skeletal muscle of 3-week-old mice were transplanted into recipient male or female dystrophin-deficient (mdx) hearts or into the hearts of male SCID mice following acute myocardial infarction. In the mdx model, no difference was seen in engraftment or blood vessel formation based on donor cell or recipient sex. In the infarction model, MDSC-transplanted hearts showed higher postinfarction angiogenesis, less myocardial scar formation, and improved cardiac function compared to vehicle controls. However, sex of donor MDSCs had no significant effects on engraftment, angiogenesis, and cardiac function. VEGF expression, a potent angiogenic factor, was similar between male and female MDSCs. Our results suggest that donor MDSC or recipient sex has no significant effect on the efficiency of MDSC-triggered myocardial engraftment or regeneration following cardiac injury. The ability of the MDSCs to improve cardiac regeneration and repair through promotion of angiogenesis without differentiation into the cardiac lineage may have contributed to the lack of sex difference observed in these models."

Concentration exceeding 2 mg/l represents an increased individual risk of myocardial infarction and stroke but strict application of this borderline is complicated by relations of CRP concentrations to other risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. In a large 1 % representative sample of the Czech population, a positive relation of hsCRP to BMI, a waist circumference and triglyceride concentration was documented. Substantial sex differences were found in its relationship to age. Whereas it is continuously increasing in men, this increase appears in women only after menopause. A substantial decrease of body weight and visceral fat volume by increased physical activity is accompanied by significant decrease of hsCRP in young obese women. This decrease was not related to a change of interleukin-6 concentration, although it is supposed to regulate CRP production. CRP concentration is partly under genetic control as a higher concentration in young siblings of probands with proved coronary atherosclerosis was documented. The participation of genes related to lipoprotein metabolism (genes for apolipoprotein CI and apolipoprotein E) influence hsCRP concentrations. We hypothesized that an increased concentration of hsCRP represents a certain marker of proinflammatory status related to central obesity and triglyceride metabolism and it might be related to individual properties of monocytes in atherogenesis."

Although cumulative incidence increased with age (p < 0.05), gender-differences tended to narrow. Adjusted incidence rates were higher in men (957 per 100 000 person-years) than in women (546 per 100 000 person-years) (p < 0.001) and increased with age (p < 0.001). The increase was progressive in women but not in men. Adjusted mortality rates were also higher in men than in women (p < 0.001), being three times higher in the age group of > or = 85 years old than in the age group of 65-74 years old (p < 0.001).Incidence of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction is high in the Spanish elderly population.

Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the association of scores on the Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS) component summary scales with clinical and sociodemographic variables.Women scored lower than norms on the Physical functioning, Role functioning-physical, General health, and Role functioning-emotional scales. Men scored higher on Bodily pain, and lower on the other 7 scales compared to norms. Women <70 years scored lower than men on 3 out of 8 scales and on PCS.

Age, time since the index MI, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), previous MI, and stroke predicted PCS scores in women. Education, COPD, infarct localization, number of indications for cardiovascular medication at discharge, medication for heart failure, and subsequent MI predicted PCS scores in men. Smoking status, education, and Q-wave MI were determinants for MCS scores in men.Patients had impaired HRQoL compared to sex- and age-specific norms 2.5 years after MI. Women had lower HRQoL scores than men, but relative to norms HRQoL was equally affected in both sexes. Men and women had different determinants of HRQoL."

There were no reference ranges for 2-dimensional (2D) speckle tracking synchrony, and it was unclear whether color tissue Doppler imaging and 2D speckle tracking synchrony indexes were comparable. One hundred twenty-two healthy volunteers and 40 patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) had LV systolic and diastolic synchrony, defined as the SD of time to peak systolic (2D-SDTs) and early diastolic (2D-SDTe) velocities in the 12 basal and mid segments using 2D speckle tracking, respectively. Mean 2D-SDTs and 2D-SDTe were 29.4 +/- 16.1 and 14.2 +/- 6.1 ms in healthy subjects, respectively. Gender and mean 2D systolic velocity independently predicted 2D-SDTs, and mean 2D early diastolic velocity independently predicted 2D-SDTe. Bland-Altman analysis showed suboptimal agreement between 2D speckle tracking and tissue Doppler imaging dyssynchrony indexes. 2D speckle tracking showed lower coefficients of variation for time to peak systolic and early diastolic velocities than tissue Doppler imaging. There were no significant differences in coefficients of variation for 2D speckle tracking systolic and diastolic synchrony for high versus low frame rates. Patients with NSTEMI had significantly lower ejection fraction, but higher LV mass and wall stress than healthy subjects. Only 2D-SDTs was significantly higher in patients with NSTEMI compared with healthy subjects (37.1 +/- 22.5 vs 29.4 +/- 16.1 ms; p = 0.02). In conclusion, 2D-SDTs was gender specific and influenced by global systolic function, and 2D-SDTe was influenced by global diastolic function. 2D speckle tracking and tissue Doppler imaging dyssynchrony indexes were not comparable. 2D speckle tracking may be a more sensitive discriminator of LV systolic dyssynchrony than tissue Doppler imaging."

Their substrates (beta-blockers, blockers of calcium channels such as nifedipine and verapamil, cyclosporine, and many others) are metabolized differently. Sex differences were observed after administration of digitalis, which is often overdosed in women. Furthermore, beta-blockers are found at higher plasma levels in women and ACE inhibitors cause more side effects in women than in men. In women, acetylsalicylic acid provides effective primary prophylaxis against stroke but not myocardial infarction. In men, these drugs have opposite effects.

Patients without a previous hospitalization for ICD9-CM codes 410* and 412* during the previous 60 months were considered as incident cases. Crude, age-specific and age-standardized incidence rates (standard: total Italian population at the 2001 census) were calculated. A number of data quality indicators were also evaluated.age-standardized incidence rates show different levels of incidence in the areas included in the study. Both for males and females, higher incidence is observed in Rome and Turin (males: respectively 260.5 and 260.2 cases/100,000; females: 105.6 cases/100,000 in both areas). The lowest incidence is observed in Taranto (males: 219.5 cases/100,000; females: 87.0 cases/100,000). Quality indicators suggest a good comparability of incidence estimates among the studied areas. In particular, in both genders, the differences observed in the incidence rates are consistent with the differences of current AMI mortality rates.although limitations in data comparability among the studied areas and in the quality of disease coding cannot be completely excluded, results suggest that the algorithm we used provides estimates of AMI incidence rates comparable among the studied areas.

Mortality of patients treated with TL was significantly higher in women than in men (15% vs 9%, p = 0.043). There was no significant gender difference in mortality in the PCI group (8.2% of women vs 6.2% of men, p = 0.409). Mortality of women treated with on-site TL was nearly twice as high as mortality of women transported for pPCI (p = 0.043). After adjustment in a multivariate model the odds ratio for mortality in women was 0.74 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.05; p = 0.556).Long-distance transportation of women with STEMI from a community hospital to a tertiary PCI centre is a significantly more effective treatment strategy than on-site TL. Gender did not determine survival in patients transported for pPCI."

Despite the significant problem of cardiac disease among women, surveys of women's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about the risks of heart disease have continually identified substantial gaps in women's knowledge. Overall, knowledge of heart disease, identification of risk factors for coronary artery disease, signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was poor for both men and women. The perception that women are less knowledgeable than men about heart disease was not consistent in the literature reviewed. In fact, in some studies, women were more knowledgeable than men in the identification of risk factors and less common symptoms of AMI."

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of aspirin separately for men and women of different ages with various levels of cardiovascular disease risk.A Markov model was developed to predict the number of cardiovascular events prevented, quality-adjusted life-years, and costs over a 10-year period. Event rates were taken from Dutch population data, and the relative effectiveness of aspirin was taken from a gender-specific meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results. In 55-year-old persons, aspirin prevented myocardial infarctions in men (127 events per 100,000 person-years) and ischemic strokes in women (17 events per 100,000 person-years). Aspirin implies a net investment and a quality-adjusted life-year gain in men 55 years of age; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 111,949 euros per quality-adjusted life-year (1 euro=$1.27 as of June 2007). Aspirin was cost-effective for 55- and 65-year-old men with moderate cardiovascular risk and men 75 years of age (10-year cardiovascular disease risk >10%). Conversely, aspirin was beneficial for women 65 years of age with high cardiovascular risk and women 75 years of age with moderate cardiovascular risk (10-year cardiovascular disease risk >15%). Results were sensitive to drug treatment costs, effectiveness of aspirin treatment, and utility of taking aspirin.Aspirin treatment for primary prevention is cost-effective for men with a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of >10% and for women with a risk of >15%. This occurs much later in life for women than men. Therefore, opportunities for the primary prevention of aspirin seem limited in women, and a differentiated preventive strategy seems warranted."

In this study, it was hypothesized that the management and outcomes of MIs would not differ by gender after proper adjustment for age, access to care, MI characteristics, and co-morbidities. Data from a published MI validation study, which sampled 2,200 MI hospitalizations in Medicare beneficiaries with the prescription drug benefit for detailed hospital chart review, were used. Gender differences in the use of MI-related procedures and recommended cardiovascular medications as well as short- and long-term mortality were assessed using multivariate regression. A total of 1,625 patients were identified (80% women) with confirmed MIs for whom complete clinical information was available. Compared with men, women were older and had higher body mass index. Women were more likely to have diabetes, renal dysfunction, and depression, but less likely to have had previous MIs, chronic lung disease, cancer, and to use tobacco. The characteristics of the index MIs were similar, except for non-Q-wave MIs being more common in men. The management of the MIs during admission was similar. During follow-up of up to 6.6 years, men were 40% more likely to die than women (95% confidence interval 21% to 62%), but no mortality difference was observed in patients aged 65 to 74 years (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 1.36), whereas in those aged > or =75 years, men were more likely to die than women (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 1.82). In conclusion, for older patients, the management of MIs did not significantly differ between men and women. Men, especially those aged > or =75 years, however, had worse short- and long-term prognoses compared with women of a similar age. The mortality was highest and the gender effect was more pronounced during the MI hospitalizations."

Atheroma burden in the left main and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) arteries was significantly greater in men than women (median, 23.0% vs. 14.1%, P = 0.002; median, 40.1% vs. 29.3%, P = 0.001, respectively). Atheroma eccentricity in the proximal LAD artery was significantly higher in men than women (median, 0.89 vs. 0.80, P = 0.04).

Sex was an independent predictor of atheroma burden in the left main and proximal LAD arteries (both P < 0.05) by multivariate analysis.Men have greater atheroma burden, more eccentric atheroma, and more diffuse epicardial endothelial dysfunction than women. These results suggest that men have more severe structural and functional abnormalities in epicardial coronary arteries than women, even in patients with early atherosclerosis, which may result in the higher incidence rates of CAD and ST-segment myocardial infarction in men than women."

During the seven year period between 2000 and 2006, 3434 patients were treated for myocardial infarction in the Split Clinical Hospital, 2336 (68%) males and 1098 (32%) females with a 12% total mortality (427 patients). The annual number of hospitalized persons has been increasing during that period (474 in yr. 2000 us. 547 in yr. 2006), while mortality decreased from 15% in 2000 to 9.6% in 2006. Female patients had significantly higher hospital mortality than male patients, (228 or 21% vs. 202 or 9%, p<0.05). Women also had significantly higher total AMI mortality (23.7% vs. 15,7%, p <0.05). Anterior myocardial infarction with ST elevation in precordial leads had significantly higher mortality (19%) compared to patients with lateral (11%), inferior (10%) myocardial infarction with ST elevation and also NSTEMI (4%) mortality p<0.05. Female patients more frequently die in hospital, 84% (230) than out of hospital 16% (43). From the total number of AMI deaths (388) in male patients, 56% (217) were in hospital and 44% (171) out of hospital (p<0.001). Men had significantly higher prehospital mortality rate than women (81% vs. 19%, p<0.05). Men also more frequently died from ventricular fibrillation (22% vs. 10%, p<0.05), while women died more frequently of heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and myocardial rupture (33% vs. 15% p<0.05). Regarding the total number of deaths from myocardial infarction men had significantly higher prehospital mortality compared to women (178 or 7.3% vs. 43 or 3.7%, p<0.05). Anterior myocardial infarction had a significantly higher rate in patients dying pre-hospital (58%), in contrast to inferior (36%) and lateral myocardial infarction with ST elevation (6%) p<0.05. We have concluded that male patients die more frequently within the first few hours of AMI mostly due to malignant arrhythmias, while female patients died in sub acute stage due to heart failure while being hospitalized. Nevertheless total mortality of AMI remains significantly higher in women."

We examined the effects of demographic, angiographic and clinical variables on the duration of hospitalisation and in-hospital mortality separately in men and in women.Women constituted 30.7% of patients treated with PCI because of AMI, 39.6% of those with UA and just 25.8% of those with SA. Women were significantly older than men, had a higher BMI, and more often suffered from hypertension and diabetes. The duration of hospitalisation was the same in men and women if the reason for PCI was SA or UA, however, in case of AMI women were hospitalised significantly longer than men. In the univariate analysis gender had no influence on in-hospital mortality regardless of the reason for PCI treatment. Among the variables subjected to multivariate analysis female gender, age, BMI, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, indication for PCI, final TIMI flow in the target vessel and cardiogenic shock as a complication of AMI were shown to affect mortality. Significant effects on in-hospital mortality for women were exhibited only by cardiogenic shock. Among men, indication for PCI, age, diabetes and final TIMI flow in the target vessel also had a significant influence on in-hospital mortality.Stable angina is a reason for performing PCI more rarely in women than in men. Women with CAD are older than men and have more risk factors. The in-hospital mortality among patients treated with PCI because of SA is independent of gender. Cardiogenic shock appeared to be the only factor that influences in-hospital mortality in women. In the case of men such an influence is also observed for indication for PCI (AMI, UA or SA), diabetes and final TIMI flow in the target vessel."

Women develop MI approximately 10 years later than men, a difference that could be explained by the genes coding for the estrogen receptors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ESR2 gene may affect susceptibility for MI in a sex-dependent manner.A nested case-control design was used to analyze 3 polymorphisms of the ESR2 gene and their associated haplotypes in 710 myocardial infarction cases from the REGICOR (Registre Gironí del Corazón) study and 2379 controls randomly selected in a representative population of a Spanish cross-sectional study.The rs1271572 T allele was significantly more common in patients who developed MI (P < 0.001). No association was observed for rs1256049 or rs4986938. Assuming a dominant model of inheritance, the association, as determined by logistic multivariate regression after adjustment for conventional cardiac risk factors, remained statistically significant in men [odds ratio (OR) 1.65, 95% CI 1.18-2.30; P = 0.003) but not in women (P = 0.754).

The prevalence of stressful psychosocial factors is higher among patients before acute myocardial infarction than among healthy controls.Patients diagnosed with first-time acute myocardial infarction were recruited from five Norwegian hospitals over a 13-month period in 2003-2004. Of 738 eligible patients, 149 women and 384 men completed a self-administered questionnaire (response rate 72%).Depression, high family stress, high work stress and major life events had no statistically significant impact on patient delay or total pre-hospital delay. Depression, sleep disturbances and high family stress were reported among more women than men in the year prior to the event. Women and men aged 65 years and younger were more likely to report major depression and major life events than those older than 65. Low education and low partner education predicted prolonged patient delay in men but not in women. Low partner education also predicted prolonged total pre-hospital delay in men.The process between symptom onset and hospital admittance is complex, and more knowledge about factors influencing this process is vital to reduce pre-hospital delay. Significant others should be included in information-giving in relation to myocardial infarction as they seem to play a vital role in patients' decision-making processes."

The primary end point was all-cause 1-year mortality. Differences in risk between men and women were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression.The number of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome was 20,206 and 15,583 before and after adoption of the guidelines, respectively. An invasive strategy during the index hospitalization was more frequent in men in both the pre- (47.6% vs 33.6, P <.001) and post- (55.7% vs 40.9%, P <.001) transition periods. Secondary prevention was intensified in the post-transition period in both sexes. Multivariate analysis adjusting for differences in baseline clinical characteristics between men and women and invasive strategy demonstrated that female sex was associated with increased 1-year mortality during the pretransition period (hazard ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval, 1.24-1.45), but was not a significant factor in the post-transition period (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.14).The transition to the 2000 European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology guidelines was associated with a reduction in the sex-based mortality difference in patients with acute coronary syndrome despite the fact that an early invasive strategy and secondary prevention continued to be underutilized in female patients in both periods."

Reviewing preoperative data could provide insight into the outpatient treatment of patients presenting for surgical procedures. As gender-based disparities have been demonstrated in the treatment of patients with cardiac disease, we hypothesized that there would be gender disparities in the outpatient pharmacologic management of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery.We analyzed electronic medical records of ambulatory patients with CAD (prior myocardial infarction [MI], coronary artery bypass surgery, and angioplasty with or without stenting, angina) presenting for elective noncardiac surgery between 1/2004 and 6/2006 (30 mo) at an inner city hospital.Of 21,039 ambulatory patients seen in the preanesthesia clinic, 6.4% (1346) had CAD. Patients with CAD: Men were more likely to be taking beta-blockers (P < 0.002), statins (P < 0.0001), aspirin (P < 0.0001), and antiplatelet medications (P < 0.04), although there was a trend of increased use of aspirin (P < 0.01) by women over the course of the study. Patients with history of prior MI: Men with a prior MI were more likely to be taking beta-blockers (P < 0.0001) and statins (P < 0.02), although there was a trend of increased use of beta-blockers (P < 0.0005) and aspirin (P < 0.03) by women over the course of the study. Quarterly prevalence rates for outpatient medication use were greatest for beta-blockers and least for aspirin. Patients were more likely to be taking a statin, aspirin, or oral antiplatelet medication if they were receiving chronic beta-blocker therapy (P < 0.0001 for each medication).Aggregating anesthesia management information systems data provides an epidemiological perspective of community care of patients presenting for surgery. We found that gender disparities in outpatient medical treatment of patients with CAD, which previously favored men, have diminished primarily as a result of increased use of these medications in women. Nonetheless, despite evidence supporting the use of risk-reduction strategies, our patients are undertreated with standard medical therapies."

Crude rates and hazard ratios for total and incident events were examined with and without adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. After 5 years, there were 127 cardiovascular disease events, 48 myocardial infarctions or cardiovascular disease deaths, and 28 strokes or stroke deaths. Total and incident cardiovascular disease event rates were higher in each quartile of CAC and CCA-IMT, but not of ICA-IMT. For total cardiovascular disease, the adjusted hazard ratio for the fourth versus first quartile of CAC was 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.9) and for CCA-IMT was 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.1). The CCA-IMT was more strongly related to stroke risk than was CAC, although CAC was also an important predictor of stroke. No significant gender differences were found, although relative risks appeared to be stronger in women, especially for stroke. In conclusion, in adults >70 years of age, CAC and CCA-IMT had similar hazard ratios for total cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease.

Although some studies have shown that there are gender differences between men and women in terms of how they cope with having a myocardial infarction (MI) and heart disease, few have explored how women actually experience MI and what influences their help-seeking behaviour. Those studies that have, suggest that women often fail to recognize the signs of MI and delay seeking treatment for symptoms of MI longer than men do. This qualitative study explores the female experience of MI, focusing on some of the thought processes and coping strategies used by women when having an MI. Using a grounded theory research approach, 25 post-MI female patients were interviewed about their experiences during acute MI. Through analysing and coding data, a number of categories emerged that provide insight into the health seeking behaviour of women at the onset of MI. Emergent categories were: a delay in seeking help (main category); an engendered perception of heart disease (sub-category); not recognizing symptoms (sub-category); maintaining control through self-medication (sub-category). Analysis of the data suggests that when experiencing an MI, women delay seeking help for a number of reasons, including not recognizing symptoms, perceiving heart disease as a 'male' problem and preferring to self-medicate."

After multivariable adjustment, sex differences in in-hospital mortality rates were no longer observed in the overall AMI cohort (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.04; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.10) but persisted among STEMI patients (10.2% versus 5.5%; P<0.0001; adjusted OR=1.12; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.23). Compared with men, women were less likely to receive early aspirin treatment (adjusted OR=0.86; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.90), early beta-blocker treatment (adjusted OR=0.90; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.93), reperfusion therapy (adjusted OR=0.75; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.80), or timely reperfusion (door-to-needle time </=30 minutes: adjusted OR=0.78; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.92; door-to-balloon time </=90 minutes: adjusted OR=0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95). Women also experienced lower use of cardiac catheterization and revascularization procedures after AMI.Overall, no sex differences in in-hospital mortality rates after AMI were observed after multivariable adjustment. However, women with STEMI had higher adjusted mortality rates than men. The underuse of evidence-based treatments and delayed reperfusion among women represent potential opportunities for reducing sex disparities in care and outcome after AMI."

Multi-variable analysis was performed using Cox's proportional hazard regression, adjusting baseline clinical and angiographical variables.There were 405 women (20%). Thrombolysis was most frequently performed in group I (50%), balloon angioplasty in group II (71%), and stent in group III (66%), with no difference in the allocation of reperfusion therapy between men and women. Three-year mortality was significantly higher in women than in men in group I (27% vs 18%, p=0.03) and group II (23% vs 15%, p=0.048). In group III, there was no significant difference in 3-year mortality (12% vs 10%, p=0.66) between women and men. Women were associated with higher age, more diabetes, more hypertension, fewer current smokers, and less previous infarction than men. Multi-variable analysis showed that sex was not an independent predictor of 3-year mortality in the three groups.Women with AMI who were treated mostly with primary intervention using stent in the contemporary era had similar mortality to men."

Owing to gender differences in mortality, specifically characterising patients below the age of 65 years, a more detailed analysis was performed within this cohort of 25 555 patients. In this group, 5786 (23%) were women and 4473 (18%) had diabetes. Differences in clinical and other parameters were adjusted for using a propensity score model.Long-term mortality in diabetic patients aged <65 years was significantly higher in women than men (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.55). Compared with diabetic men, women had an increased risk factor burden (hypertension 49 vs 43%; RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.20; heart failure 10 vs 8%; RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.53). Diabetic women aged <65 years were less frequently treated with intravenous beta-blockade during the acute hospital phase and with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at hospital discharge. However, this under-use was not associated with the mortality differences, nor was female gender by itself.Women below 65 years of age with diabetes have a poorer outcome than men after a myocardial infarction. This relates to an increased risk factor burden. It is suggested that greater awareness of this situation and improved prevention have the potential to improve what is an unfavourable situation for these women."

Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2008 Aug,Pathophysiology,Mouse,na,,"Recent awareness of cardiovascular diseases as a number one killer of the middle-aged women has prompted interest in sex differences leading to heart failure (HF). Therefore, we evaluated cardiac function in female and male mice following myocardial infarction (MI) using the Millar pressure-volume (P-V) conductance system in vivo, at time points corresponding to early (2 wk), late compensatory hypertrophy (4 wk), and decompensation (10 wk) to HF. A significant deterioration of the load dependent and independent hemodynamic measurements occurred in both female and male mice during the early phase of hypertrophy. Later, compensatory hypertrophy was marked by a normalization of volumes to control levels in females compared with males. The most notable differences between sexes occurred in the measurements of cardiac contractility during the decompensation to HF. In females, there was a significant improvement in contractility compared with males, which was apparent in the load-independent measurements of preload recruitable stroke work (10 wk post-MI, female=48.7+/-8.0 vs. male=25.2+/-1.8 mmHg, P<0.05) and maximum dP/dt vs. maximum end-diastolic volume (10 wk post-MI, female=359+/-58 vs. male=149+/-28 mmHg.s(-1).microl(-1), P<0.05). Despite these differences, there were no differences in the heart weight to body weight ratio and infarct size between the sexes. These data demonstrate that compensatory hypertrophy is associated with an improvement in contractility and a delayed decompensation to HF in females. However, compensatory hypertrophy in males appears to be undermined by a steady decline in contractility associated with decompensation to HF."

Multiple genes and their interaction with various environmental factors influence the pathogenesis of MI that is thought to be tightly regulated by inflammatory pathways. Recent progress in genetic analysis includes the use of large-scale genome-wide association studies that have proven to be powerful tools even in the analysis of multifactorial phenotypes. However, certain genes are only sparsely represented on the available gene chips and additional candidate gene approaches are necessary. One such example is the CNR2 gene, encoding the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), which has been implicated in mediating anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in vivo. We therefore hypothesized that genetic variations within the CNR2 gene are associated with the development of MI or classic cardiovascular risk factors. In a large case-control study, 1,968 individuals from the German MI family study were examined with 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering CNR2 and the adjacent genes. The association of these SNPs with MI or cardiovascular risk factors, such as arterial hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus, was determined. In allelic and genotypic models, none of the SNPs showed a significant association with MI. Separate analyses for men and women revealed no gender-specific relationship between common genetic variations within the CNR2 gene and MI. Moreover, no significant association between CNR2 gene variants and common cardiovascular risk factors was observed. We therefore provide evidence in a large German population that common polymorphisms within the CNR2 gene confer no susceptibility to MI or to cardiovascular risk factors."

CAD was defined as a documented history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, or an abnormal coronary angiogram (stenosis of >50% in an epicardial coronary artery), or angina plus abnormal imaging stress test.Males had higher triglyceride level (P<0.001) but lower total cholesterol (P<0.001) and HDL-cholesterol level (P<0.001) compared to women.

The median age of first acute MI was higher in women than men (65 vs. 56 years; P < 0.0001). Nine modifiable risk factors were associated with MI in women and men. Hypertension [2.95(2.66 -3.28) vs. 2.32(2.16-2.48)], diabetes [4.26(3.68-4.94) vs. 2.67(2.43-2.94), physical activity [0.48(0.41-0.57) vs. 0.77(0.71-0.83)], and moderate alcohol use [0.41(0.34-0.50) vs. 0.88(0.82-0.94)] were more strongly associated with MI among women than men. The association of abnormal lipids, current smoking, abdominal obesity, high risk diet, and psychosocial stress factors with MI was similar in women and men. Risk factors associations were generally stronger among younger individuals compared to older women and men. The population attributable risk (PAR) of all nine risk factors exceeded 94%, and was similar among women and men (96 vs. 93%). Men were significantly more likely to suffer a MI prior to 60 years of age than were women, however, after adjusting for levels of risk factors, the sex difference in the probability of MI cases occurring before the age of 60 years was reduced by more than 80%.Women experience their first acute MI on average 9 years later than men. Nine modifiable risk factors are significantly associated with acute MI in both men and women and explain greater than 90% of the PAR. The difference in age of first MI is largely explained by the higher risk factor levels at younger ages in men compared to women."

More recently age and gender differences in cardiac mortality and to a lesser extent morbidity have been presented. To date spatial differences between the seasonal patterns of cardiac disease has not been presented. Literature relating to seasonal patterns in cardiac disease in the southern hemisphere and in Australia in particular is scarce. The aim of this paper is to describe the seasonal, age, gender, and spatial patterns of cardiac disease in Melbourne Australia by using acute myocardial infarction admissions to hospital as a marker of cardiac disease.There were 33,165 Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) admissions over 2186 consecutive days. There is a seasonal pattern in AMI admissions with increased rates during the colder months. The peak month is July. The admissions rate is greater for males than for females, although this difference decreases with advancing age. The maximal AMI season for males extends from April to November. The difference between months of peak and minimum admissions was 33.7%. Increased female AMI admissions occur from May to November, with a variation between peak and minimum of 23.1%. Maps of seasonal AMI admissions demonstrate spatial differences. Analysis using Global and Local Moran's I showed increased spatial clustering during the warmer months. The Bivariate Moran's I statistic indicated a weaker relationship between AMI and age during the warmer months.There are two distinct seasons with increased admissions during the colder part of the year. Males present a stronger seasonal pattern than females. There are spatial differences in AMI admissions throughout the year that cannot be explained by the age structure of the population. The seasonal difference in AMI admissions warrants further investigation. This includes detailing the prevalence of cardiac disease in the community and examining issues of social and environmental justice."

Inflammatory cell infiltration and myofibroblast transformation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activity, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-I expression, and neovascularization were examined by immunohistochemistry, zymography, Western blot, and laser scanning confocal microscopy, respectively. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography on day 14.We found that: (1) neutrophil infiltration during the early phase of MI (1-4 days) was much lower in females than in males and was associated with lower MMP-9 activity and higher TIMP-1 protein expression, indicating less-exaggerated inflammation and extracellular matrix degradation in females; (2) myofibroblast transformation, as indicated by expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, was significantly greater in females than in males at day 7 of MI (P<0.05), indicating facilitated collagen deposition and scar formation; and (3) neovascularization (vascular area in the infarct border) was markedly increased in females, and was associated with better preserved cardiac function and less left ventricular dilatation.Our data suggest that less-exaggerated early inflammation and augmented reparative fibrotic response, indicated by enhanced myofibroblast transformation, may contribute greatly to low rupture rates in females during the acute and subacute phases of MI, whereas enhanced neovascularization may lead to better preserved cardiac function post-MI."

Differences between women and men have been identified throughout the entire spectrum of ischemic heart disease, from risk factors to presentation and from diagnosis to treatment and outcomes. In the setting of an acute coronary syndrome or acute myocardial infarction, women are significantly more likely than men to report multiple non-chest pain symptoms, including dyspnea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, neck pain, and jaw pain. Investigations into the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease in women have broken away from the traditional thinking that coronary artery disease simply equals epicardial stenosis. In women, the new paradigm of coronary artery disease also focuses on diffuse atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and microvascular disease. Further research focusing on sex differences in cardiovascular disease is needed, but enough is currently known to offer a sex-based approach, which may ultimately lead to improved outcomes."

We hypothesized that damage to the collagen matrix of infarcted myocardium is the central mechanism of rupture and therefore responsible for the difference in the incidence of rupture between genders. We examined left ventricular (LV) remodeling during the acute phase post-MI in 129sv mice. Following induction of MI, we monitored rupture events and assessed the extent of LV remodeling by echocardiography. Muscle tensile strength, content of insoluble and soluble collagen, expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and density of inflammatory cells were determined in the infarcted and non-infarcted myocardium. We then tested the effects of MMP inhibition on rupture. Compared to female mice, males with MI displayed greater extent of LV remodeling, reduced muscle tensile strength, loss of insoluble collagen, local inflammatory response and MMP-9 activation, changes associated with a 3 times higher incidence of rupture than in females. MMP-9 expression by circulating blood mononuclear cells was also increased in male mice with acute MI. Treatment of male mice with an MMP inhibitor reduced MMP activity and halved rupture incidence. Our findings demonstrate that the differences in the severity of inflammation, MMP activation and damage to collagen matrix account for gender difference in cardiac rupture. Our study illustrates the breakdown of fibril collagen as a central mechanism of cardiac rupture."

Reductions in mortality, MI, and stroke predominantly contributed to the reduction in cardiovascular events in men taking statins. Women did not have a reduction in mortality or stroke, suggesting that the reductions in cardiac events may have been predominantly due to reductions in need for revascularization and/or unstable angina.Statins reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in men and women, but women on statins may not have reductions in mortality and stroke like their male counterparts."

Adult Sprague Dawley rats were divided into vehicle treated reperfusion injury group male (I/R-M), female (I/R-F), ovariectomised (I/R-OVR) and progesterone treatment (I/R-M+PG, I/R-F+PG, I/R-OVR+PG) groups, respectively. I/R injury was produced by occluding the left descending coronary artery (LCA) for 1 h and followed by re-opening for 1 h. Progesterone (2 mg kg(-1) i.p.) was administered 30 min after induction of ischemia. Hemodynamic parameters (+/-dp/dt, MAP), heart rate, ST-segment elevation and occurrence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) were measured during the I/R period. The myocardial infarct area, oxidative stress markers, activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and creatine kinase (CK) were determined after the experiment along with the assessment of the effect on apoptotic activity by using DNA fragmentation analysis. Histological observations were carried out on heart tissue. Treatment with progesterone significantly (P<0.05) reduced infarct area, lipid peroxidation (LPO) level and activity of MPO in females (I/R-F+PG) as compared to ischemic females (I/R-F). Progesterone significantly (P<0.001, P<0.05) inhibited serum CK activity and incidences of VT in female rats. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly elevated (P<0.05) in I/R-F+PG group. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was less in I/R-F+PG group when compared to I/R-F group. The ischemic male and ovariectomised (I/R-M and I/R-OVR) counterparts did not show any significant change after progesterone treatment. In conclusion, the cardioprotective effect of progesterone on myocardial I/R injury induced damage is based on gender of the animal. The protective effect could be mediated by attenuation of inflammation and its possible interaction with endogenous estrogen."

They studied the location and distribution of craniofacial and intraoral pain in detail.Craniofacial pain was the only complaint during the ischemic episode in 11 patients (6 percent), three of them who had acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Another 60 patients (32 percent) reported craniofacial pain concomitant with pain in other regions. The most common craniofacial pain locations were the throat, left mandible, right mandible, left temporomandibular joint/ear region and teeth. Craniofacial pain was pre-ponderantly manifested in female subjects (P = .031) and was the dominating symptom in both sexes in the absence of chest pain.Craniofacial pain commonly is induced by cardiac ischemia. This must be considered in differential diagnosis of toothache and orofacial pain.Because patients who have AMI without chest pain run a higher risk of experiencing a missed diagnosis and death, the dentist's awareness of this symptomatology can be crucial for early diagnosis and timely treatment."

This difference has been ascribed to their older age, more frequent comorbidities, and less frequent use of revascularization. The aim of this study is to assess these factors in relation to excess mortality in women.All hospital admissions in France with a discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction were extracted from the national payment database. Logistic regression on mortality was performed for age, comorbidities, and coronary interventions. Nonparametric microsimulation models estimated the percutaneous coronary intervention and mortality rates that women would experience if they were ""treated like men."" Data were analyzed from 74,389 patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction, 30.0% of whom were women. Women were older (75 versus 63 years of age; P<0.001) and had a higher rate of hospital mortality (14.8% versus 6.1%; P<0.0001) than men. Percutaneous coronary interventions were more frequent in men (7.4% versus 4.8%; 24.4% versus 14.2% with stent; P<0.001). Mortality adjusted for age and comorbidities was higher in women (P<0.001), with an excess adjusted absolute mortality of 1.95%. Simulation models related 0.46% of this excess to reduced use of procedures. Survival benefit related to percutaneous coronary intervention was lower among women.The difference in mortality rate between men and women with acute myocardial infarction is due largely to the different age structure of these populations. However, age-adjusted hospital mortality was higher for women and was associated with a lower rate of percutaneous coronary intervention. Simulations suggest that women would derive benefit from more frequent use of percutaneous coronary intervention, although these procedures appear less protective in women than in men."

In analyses of gender differences in benefits of PCI 1 month after the STEMI, significant gender differences were found in the SF-36 mental component summary scale, with men having better scores after primary PCI and women having better scores after fibrinolysis (P=0.03). At 12 months, similar gender differences in treatment benefit were found in the SF-36 scales for general health (P=0.01), mental health (P<0.01), and the mental component summary scale (P=0.01), as well as in the scales for anxiety (P=0.04), depression (P=0.02), and global quality of life (P<0.01); men had better scores after primary-PCI and women had better scores after fibrinolysis.Compared to fibrinolysis treatment in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, women do not seem to benefit from primary PCI to the same degree as men. Since previous studies have found no gender differences in clinical outcomes, this result may be specific to HRQoL."

The study base included all Swedish citizens aged 45-70 in Stockholm County during 1992-94, 550 female and 1201 male cases, and 776 female and 1538 male controls. The use of an occupational classification as the base for categorizing socioeconomic position was compared with socioeconomic position based on detailed self-reported information on job titles and work tasks.Women are categorized into fewer occupational categories than men and the socioeconomic heterogeneity within occupational categories is substantial for women as has been reported by others. However, despite more occupational categories for male types of jobs the socioeconomic heterogeneity within occupational categories is actually larger for men, implying larger misclassification among men. In simulations with different levels of socioeconomic misclassification among women, the effects on the gender comparison of socioeconomic differences in disease risk were small and they were mostly compensated for by less misclassification among men.The findings do not support the assumption that misclassification of socioeconomic position among women due to a restricted working market and a crude occupational classification for female jobs is an important issue when comparing measures of socioeconomic inequalities in health between men and women."

The findings demonstrated that the most commonly reported symptom in both genders was chest pain. More than 90% of women and men experienced chest pain, with no difference between the genders. More women than men had nausea as well as pain located in their arms, back, jaw, and throat. More men than women attributed their symptoms to be cardiac in origin. Experiencing pain in the shoulders, attributing symptoms to be noncardiac, consulting a family member, and contacting several medical practitioners increased prehospital delay. During the year before the event, women were more likely to experience fatigue than men. The conclusion of this study is that women experienced a greater diversity of symptoms than men.

Further, long-term differences have not been addressed widely. The present study examined gender differences in short- and long-term prognoses after AMI in The Netherlands. A nationwide cohort of 21,565 patients with a first hospitalized AMI in 1995 was identified through linkage of the National Hospital Discharge Register and the population register. Crude short- and long-term mortalities were significantly higher in women than in men (28-day hazard ratio [HR] 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58 to 1.82; 5-year HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.46 to 1.59).

When differences in other covariates were also taken into account, the risk differences remained virtually the same. To account for differences in reperfusion procedures, we repeated the analyses in 1,176 patients who underwent acute reperfusion therapy (angioplasty/thrombolysis). Comparable, but not statistically significant, gender differences were observed (28-day HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.74; 5-year HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.08). In conclusion, our findings in an unselected cohort covering a complete nation indicate that the worse short- and long-term prognoses after an AMI in women compared with men may largely be explained by differences in age, whereas differences in co-morbidity, origin, infarct location, and reperfusion therapy seem to contribute little."

The effect of gender and its interaction with age, risk factors and thrombolytic therapy on overall mortality and mechanisms of death were examined using logistic regression.Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was higher in women (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.47-2.15). Adjustment that included both age only and age and other baseline differences (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, AMI type, AMI site, mean peak CK value, thrombolytic therapy) decreased the magnitude of the relative risk of women to men but did not eliminate it (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03-1.54 and OR 1.31 95% CI 1.03-1.66, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that female gender was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality after the first AMI. Women were dying more often because of mechanical complications - refractory pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock (P=0.02) or electromechanical dissociation (P=0.03), and men were dying mostly by arrhythmic death, primary ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (P=0.002). Female gender was independently associated with mechanical death (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.35-2.58; P=0.01) and anterior AMI was independently associated with arrhythmic death (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.86; P=0.01).Our results demonstrate significant differences in mechanisms of in-hospital death after the first AMI in women and men, suggesting the possibility that higher in-hospital mortality in women exists primarily because of the postponing AMI death due to the gender-related differences in susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias following acute coronary events."

Coronary heart disease is underdiagnosed, undertreated, and under-researched in women. Women with suspected heart disease are less likely than men to receive indicated diagnostic tests and procedures; sex-based biases in treatment of myocardial infarction persist; and women continue to be underrepresented in cardiovascular research. An accumulating body of literature points to 3 major explanations: sex-based physiology, provider bias, and psychosocial influences. Women's acute and prodromal signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction have been described, yet women have difficulty recognizing and acting on these indications. Primary and secondary prevention of heart disease in women is imperative; although the science is lacking in several areas, existing evidence on diet, hormone therapy, aspirin, physical activity and obesity, and diabetes can serve as the basis for interventions. Potentially, large impacts could be made on women's morbidity and mortality if current scientific knowledge were implemented.

Hypercholesterolemia was an independent risk factor for AMI in men (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.98; p < 0.05), but not in women.Hypertension, diabetes, current smoking, family history and hypercholesterolemia are associated with AMI in Japanese patients, and the importance of the risk factors for AMI differs between men and women. Hypertension, current smoking, diabetes and family history are the most important risk factors in men, whereas current smoking, diabetes, hypertension and family history are the most important risk factors in women. Hypercholesterolemia is an independent risk factor for AMI in men, but not in women. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical study to define the relative importance of risk factors for AMI in Japanese patients."

Heart and circulatory physiology,2006 May,Pathophysiology,Human,na,,"Cardiac rupture can be fatal after myocardial infarction (MI). Experiments in animals revealed gender differences in rupture rate; however, patient data are controversial. We found a significantly higher rupture rate in testosterone-treated female mice within 1 wk after MI, whereas castration in males significantly reduced rupture. We hypothesized that testosterone may adversely affect remodeling after MI, exaggerating the inflammatory response and increasing cardiac rupture, whereas estrogen may be cardioprotective, attenuating early remodeling and reducing rupture rate. We studied the effect of gender and hormone manipulation on morphological and histological changes during early remodeling after MI in 4-wk-old male and female C57BL/6J mice and how these events could affect cardiac function. Females were randomly divided into 1) sham ovariectomy + placebo (s-ovx + P), 2) s-ovx + testosterone (T), 3) ovx + P, and 4) ovx + T; males were divided into 1) sham castration + P (s-cas + P), 2) s-cas + 17beta-estradiol (E), 3) cas + P, and 4) cas + E. At 6 wk after gonadectomy and hormone manipulation, MI was induced. Mice were randomly killed 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 days after MI. The left ventricle was weighed and sectioned for evaluation of MI size, infarct expansion index (IEI), and neutrophil infiltration. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in conscious mice in the 14-day group before organ harvest. Cardiac rupture rate and IEI were significantly higher in testosterone-treated females and noncastrated males than in controls; these effects were accompanied by enhanced neutrophil infiltration and pronounced deterioration of cardiac function and left ventricular dilatation. Ovariectomy in females and estrogen supplementation in males did not confer significant protection from cardiac rupture, IEI, or neutrophil infiltration. We concluded that, in mice, high testosterone levels enhance acute myocardial inflammation, adversely affecting myocardial healing and early remodeling, as indicated by increased cardiac rupture, and possibly causing deterioration of cardiac function after MI, and, conversely, estrogen seems to have no significant protective effect in the acute phase after MI."

The REPLACE-2 trial demonstrated that bivalirudin with provisional glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GpIIb-IIIa) blockade is noninferior to heparin with planned GpIIb-IIIa blockade during PCI, with regard to ischemic and bleeding end points.The aim of this study was to define sex-based clinical ischemic and bleeding outcomes from the REPLACE-2 trial.A retrospective sex-based subgroup analysis of the REPLACE-2 trial comparing clinical ischemic and inhospital bleeding end points was conducted.Compared with men in REPLACE-2, women were older, had more diabetes, congestive heart failure and hypertension, and less prior revascularization and myocardial infarction. Female sex was a univariate predictor of death and bleeding complications. Among women treated with either bivalirudin or heparin, there was no significant difference in the individual or composite ischemic end points of death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization at 30 days or 6 months. Protocol-defined major bleeding, minor bleeding, and access site bleeding were less frequent with bivalirudin compared with heparin. Multivariable modeling found no significant interactions between sexes, with the composite ischemic end point, major bleeding, or 1-year mortality.Women remain at higher risk for poorer outcomes with contemporary PCI, likely because of comorbidities. Bivalirudin with provisional GpIIb-IIIa confers similar protection against ischemic end points compared with heparin and planned GpIIb-IIIa blockade and significantly reduces the inherent bleeding risk of women undergoing contemporary PCI."

Both race/ethnicity and gender are associated with differences in the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of Medicare recipients with these conditions. In the AMI group, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients of both genders were less likely to receive aspirin or beta-blockers than non-Hispanic Whites. These differences persisted for Hispanic women and men even when they presented with ESRD or diabetes. Rates for smoking cessation counseling were among the lowest among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics with AMI-diabetes and non-Hispanic blacks with AMI-hypertension/ESRD. Gender comparisons within racial groups for the AMI and AMI-diabetes groups show that among non-Hispanic Whites, women were less likely to receive aspirin and beta-blockers. No gender differences were noted among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic Medicare recipients. In the CHF group, Hispanics were the racial/ethnic group least likely to have an assessment of left ventricular function (LVF), even if they had diabetes and had lower rates of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy or even if they had combined CHF-hypertension/ESRD. Gender comparisons in both the CHF and CHF-hypertension/ESRD groups show that non-Hispanic White women were less likely to have an LVF assessment than non-Hispanic White men. Among all subjects, having comorbidities with AMI was not associated with higher markers of quality cardiovascular care. Closing the many gaps in cardiovascular care must target the specific needs of women and men across racial and ethnic groups."

Compared with men, women were significantly older; had higher incidences of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, Killip class > or =2, and cardiogenic shock; had a higher blood glucose level and a lower serum creatinine level on admission. Other baseline characteristics, including the incidences of ST-segment elevation AMI, anterior infarction, 3-vessel disease, initial or final Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade did not significantly differ between the sexes. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in women than in men (9.4% vs 5.2%, p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, age, Killip class, blood glucose level, serum creatinine level, and final TIMI grade were independent predictors of in-hospital death, but female gender was not (odds ratio 1.01, p=0.69).Our findings suggest that in patients undergoing primary stenting for AMI, women have higher in-hospital mortality than men, but female gender itself is not independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality after adjustment for baseline differences."

We sought to examine the neglected topic of sex differences in workup and outcomes in the general population presenting with chest pain.We examined 439 consecutive patients admitted via the emergency department with ongoing chest pain. Cardiac testing was defined as any cardiac catheterization or stress test. Positive testing was defined as a 70% or greater stenosis in an epicardial coronary artery on catheterization, or a positive stress test result. Follow-up was obtained via telephone contact at 4 months following discharge.Further cardiac testing was deemed necessary in 68% (164/241) of women and 77% (153/198) of men (P=0.038). Among women undergoing further testing, only 21% (35/164) had positive tests, whereas 41% (62/153) of men had positive tests (P=0.002). At 4 months, women were less likely to have suffered the combined endpoint of subsequent myocardial infarction, revascularization, or death, than men (15 vs. 23%, P=0.027). Events were more likely to occur in patients who had further testing, and especially in those who had positive testing.These data suggest that women admitted with chest pain are less likely to have active coronary artery disease, and much less likely to have poor outcomes at 4 months than men. This apparent 'gender protection' effect warrants further study."

Therefore, using data from TAMIS-II, we studied the influence of gender on the delivery of cardiac management according to 2 age groups (< 65, >or= 65). TAMIS-II is a prospective study of all consecutive patients admitted to the 15 acute care hospitals in the Tokai region with the diagnosis of AMI from 2001 to 2003. A total of 169 younger women, 1246 younger men, 616 older women, and 1240 older men were included. Data on patient demographics, in-hospital course, comorbid conditions, electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound-echocardiogram (UCG), treadmill test (TMT), coronary angiography (CAG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital or discharge medications (thrombolytics, vasopressors, aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, nitrates) were collected. After controlling for these baseline variables, only lipid-lowering therapy tended to be more frequent in women than in men among the elderly (OR 1.55, 95%CI 1.00-2.38).

We assessed whether this was due to patterns of hospital admission or less frequent revascularization even when resources are available. Using New York City hospital discharge records from 1995 to 2002, we determined revascularization rates for patients who were hospitalized for AMI. Rates of admission to hospitals capable of revascularizing and revascularization use were assessed by gender. Odds ratios of admission and procedure use were determined after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and accounting for availability of revascularization in neighborhoods of residence. Of 93,978 patients with AMI (43.7% women), 27% were revascularized (32% and 20% for men and women, respectively, p <0.001). Moreover, women were less likely than men to be admitted to hospitals capable of revascularization (45% vs 52%, p <0.001) and to undergo revascularization (54% vs 60%, p <0.001) when admitted to capable hospitals. These differences were similar for residents of neighborhoods with or without revascularization services. Odds ratios for men versus women were 1.22 (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.26) for admission to revascularizing hospitals and 1.28 (95% confidence interval 1.22 to 1.34) for using revascularization among patients in revascularization hospitals. The in-hospital mortality advantage of men over women persisted after revascularization (9.6% vs 14.5%). In conclusion, less revascularization after AMI among women was associated with less frequent admission to hospitals capable of revascularization and less frequent revascularization even when admitted to performing hospitals. However, improving revascularization among women does not eliminate the gender disparity of in-hospital death after AMI."

The objective of this study was to investigate the relative benefits of the GAP program in men and women.By using a predesign-postdesign, standard orders, and a discharge tool to improve evidence-based indicator rates and long-term mortality in patients with AMI in Michigan, this study compared the success of GAP in men vs women. Logistic regression was used to develop predictive models for death at 30 days and 1 year in men and women.Use of evidence-based care, including use of beta-blockers and aspirin in men and women at hospital discharge and lipid-lowering agent use in men, was higher in the post-GAP sample (P<.01 for all). Use of the discharge tool promoted by the GAP program was independently protective against death at 1 year in women (adjusted odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.79), and a trend existed for similar results in men (adjusted odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-1.06). However, the tool was used slightly less often with women (27.9% vs 33.96%; P=.003).The GAP program increased the use of evidence-based therapies in male and female patients. In addition, the GAP discharge tool may decrease mortality rates at 1 year in patients with AMI; however, the tool was used less often with women. Greater use of the GAP discharge tool in women might narrow the post-MI sex mortality gap."

Further experiments showed that blocking the K(ATP) channels in ischemia, and not reperfusion, was sufficient to increase infarct size in female rats. These data demonstrate that sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels are centrally involved in mechanisms that underlie sex differences in the susceptibility of the intact heart to I/R injury."

Women with MI were slightly less likely to receive aspirin and slightly more likely to receive ACE inhibitors. Among patients with equivocal indications, men were significantly more likely than women to undergo cardiac catheterization, whereas there were no sex differences among patients with strong indication. Women were more likely than men to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention and less likely to receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Short-term mortality rates after MI and readmission rates after heart failure did not vary significantly by gender; however, risk of mortality after heart failure was slightly lower for women.

This study evaluated the impact of gender on treatment strategies and outcomes in patients with NSTE ACS in a high-volume, single-site tertiary center. We identified 1,197 consecutive patients with NSTE ACS (381 women, 816 men) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention during their index hospitalizations. Patients were stratified by gender and baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics, and in-hospital and 9-month clinical outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. There were clear differences in baseline characteristics between men and women with ACS at presentation. Women were, on average, slightly older than men, with more hypertension and morbid obesity, but there were no differences in racial backgrounds or the prevalence of diabetes or dyslipidemia, nor were there treatment disparities in pharmacologic interventions. Women and men with ACS had similar rates of percutaneous coronary intervention on index admission. Women had a greater incidence of bleeding complications requiring blood transfusions. Overall, in-hospital and 9-month event-free survival were equivalent for the 2 genders. In conclusion, in this single-site observational study, patients with NSTE ACS who underwent angiography followed by percutaneous coronary intervention demonstrated no significant gender differences in treatment or in-hospital or 9-month event-free survival. From these results, interventional strategies should not be based on gender."

The baseline characteristics, periprocedural complications, angiographic success, procedural success, and major in-hospital complications (death, myocardial infarction, and emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery) after PCI were compared between men and women. Women were more likely to be nonwhite and older, with a greater prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (all p <0.001) compared with men.

Chi-square analysis was used to determine differences by gender and age.Three hundred eighty-five patients with STEMI were identified. Thirty-eight percent were women and 71% were over 60 years of age. Of the 270 (70%) who did not receive BB, 141 (52%) had contraindications to BB use. The total BB eligible group was 244 (63%).

Patients underwent rest thallium-201/stress technetium-99m sestamibi gated myocardial perfusion SPECT and were followed up for 35 +/- 14 months. The upper limit of the end-systolic volume (ESV) index was 27 mL/m2 in women and 39 mL/m2 in men, and the upper limit of the end-diastolic volume index was 60 mL/m2 in women and 75 mL/m2 in men. The lower limit of the EF was 51% in women and 43% in men. Gated SPECT variables provided incremental prognostic information in both genders. Women with severe ischemia and an EF lower than 51% or an ESV index greater than 27 mL/m2 were at very high risk of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (3-year event rates of 39.8% and 35.1%, respectively), whereas women with severe ischemia but an EF of 51% or greater or an ESV index of 27 mL/m2 or less were at intermediate or high risk (3-year event rates of 10.8% and 15.2%, respectively).Poststress EF and ESV index by gated myocardial perfusion SPECT provide comparable incremental prognostic information over perfusion in women and men. After separate criteria for abnormal EF and ESV index in women are used, the combination of severe ischemia and abnormal EF or ESV index identifies women at very high risk of cardiac events."

The purpose of this research was to determine whether there were gender disparities in the use of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Pennsylvania in 2000 and, if so, whether outcomes were affected.Data included 10,170 patients treated with PCI and 21,181 patients medically managed in Pennsylvania hospitals. Multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression to estimate the impact of gender on PCI. In addition, we performed retrospective matching on propensity scores to compare outcomes for women who were treated with PCI to comparable groups of women and men.After controlling for age, race/ethnicity, severity at admission, location of infarct, and source of admission, women had 24% lower odds than men of receiving PCI (P<0.0001). In a propensity score-matched sample of 3023 women who received PCI and 3023 women who did not, women who received PCI were significantly less likely to die (2.3% vs. 10.4%, P<0.0001). In a second propensity score-matched sample of 3329 women and 3329 similar men who received PCI, the difference in mortality was not statistically significant (1.59% vs. 1.92%, P=0.39).These results suggest that the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI in women could be reduced by increased use of PCI and that more women admitted for AMI should receive consideration for PCI."

Data were analysed thematically according to the theoretical framework.The development of a serious model of the illness and the decision to seek help was influenced by the experience of severe, unusual symptoms especially if of sudden onset; the absence of co-morbidities and similarities to the known experience of others. Perceived lack of susceptibility to the disease and a belief that symptoms were benign may have resulted in a delay in seeking help. Coping strategies were initially aimed at relieving symptoms before seeking help from families and friends. This resulted in a call for professional help.Health promotion strategies need to emphasis the uniqueness of the individual's experience.

The differences between men and women in heart disease, such as signs and symptoms presentation, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, are becoming more apparent in the literature. There is a dearth of research regarding gender differences among Jordanian myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the differences between Jordanian men and women in signs and symptoms presentation of MI and follow-up care. A convenience sample of 83 patients (26 women and 57 men) who were diagnosed with MI, mentally competent and haemodynamically stable were used to explore the research questions. An interview guide and chart audit were used to elicit information about initial and associated signs and symptoms and treatment plan of MI patients. Chest pain was the most common initial symptom in both men and women. The four most common associated signs and symptoms reported by both men and women were general weakness, sweating, nausea and fatigue. However, women experienced more general weakness and sweating compared with men. Women were less likely to receive intravenous nitroglycerin, heparin and thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of MI. Chest pain was the initial symptom of MI reported by men and women. Although similarities exist in the associated sings and symptoms, women might experience different associated signs and symptoms from men. Despite these similarities, women are still less likely than men to receive the therapeutic regimen used for men."

In a multivariate analysis, we specifically studied the interaction between the factors diabetes mellitus and gender in their effects on hospital mortality.After adjustment in multivariate analysis, the interaction between gender and diabetes was statistically significant, and the estimated odds ratios were as follows: female diabetic patients compared with male diabetic patients, odds ratio (OR) = 2.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-3.68); female diabetic patients compared with male nondiabetic patients, OR = 2.90 (95% CI 1.90-4.42); and female diabetic patients compared with female nondiabetic patients, OR = 2.92 (95% CI 1.75-4.87). There was no statistically significant difference between the risk of dying for female nondiabetic patients or for male diabetic patients when compared with male nondiabetic patients.In AMI patients aged < or = 75 years, female gender alone is not an independent predictor of hospital mortality. Detailed, multivariate analysis reveals that specifically diabetic women demonstrate higher hospital mortality than do men. Special attention should be provided to these female diabetic patients."

At 12 months, 60 women and 88 men remained. Data were collected using the Jalowiec Coping Scale, a social support questionnaire, the SF-36 Health Survey (health-related quality of life) and the Quality of Life Index-Cardiac version (quality of life). The data were collected during the period 1999-2001.No statistically significant changes over time in coping assessments emerged in the study group, except for fatalistic coping, which diminished over time in men. Women used more evasive coping than men at 4 and 12 months. The perceived efficiency in coping with physical aspects of the heart disease increased. More women than men perceived available support from grandchildren and staff of the church. Health-related quality of life increased in women and men in physical functioning, role-physical, vitality, social functioning, and role-emotional scales. Moreover, an improvement in the mental health scale was evident in women and a reduction in pain in men. No statistically significant gender differences were found for quality of life at any point in time.The findings can be used to inform caregivers that optimistic, self-reliant and confrontational coping were the most frequently used by both women and men over the first year after myocardial infarction, and that confrontational coping has been shown to have positive outcomes in the longer term. Nurses should tell women about the importance of seeking prompt treatment and discuss health problems with caregivers and significant others. Care planning should include family members and significant others so that they can support and encourage patients to cope with problems in daily life."

Data from the Tokai Acute Myocardial Infarction Study (TAMIS) sample were used. This is a retrospective study of all consecutive patients admitted to the 13 acute care hospitals in the Tokai region of Japan, which includes Aichi and Shizuoka Prefectures, with a diagnosis of AMI from 1995 to 1997.

Major depression in healthy subjects increases cardiovascular mortality in both men and women. The presence of major depression in patients with recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or unstable angina more than doubles the risk of cardiac death in both men and women. In the presence of depression, lack of social integration has an additive effect on cardiac events. Depression is more prevalent in women with coronary heart disease (CHD) than in men. Psychologic counseling as well as cognitive behavioral treatment in women post-AMI seems to adversely affect prognosis, whereas it has neutral effects in men. Pharmacologic treatment of depression with serotonin reuptake inhibitors is safe in men and women post-AMI and is particularly effective in patients with recurrent depression. Whether effective treatment of depression lowers cardiac mortality remains to be proven."

Often forgotten, women have higher complication rates post revascularization and higher in-hospital mortality post myocardial infarction compared with men despite a smaller burden of disease in women. Though overall women share the same risk factors as men in the development of CAD, certain risk factors appear to be particularly ominous, such as the presence of diabetes mellitus, low values of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high triglycerides, and psychologic depression. Disease detection in advanced CAD is more accurate with stress echocardiography (ECG) and perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography imaging in women than with stress ECG.

The estrogen-androgen paradox.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2005 May,Pathophysiology,Human,na,,"The strikingly lower incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) in premenopausal women than in men of the same age suggests an important role for sex hormones in the etiology of MI. Supporting such a role are studies, carried out mostly in men, that report abnormalities of sex hormone levels in patients with MI, correlations of sex hormone levels with degree of atherosclerosis and with levels of risk factors for MI, and changes in the levels of risk factors with administration of sex hormones. Studies have also reported a prospective relationship in men of testosterone level with progression of atherosclerosis, accumulation of visceral adipose tissue, and other risk factors for MI. Puzzling, however, is that neither the level of testosterone nor of estrogen was found to be predictive of coronary events in any of the eight prospective studies that have been carried out. Also puzzling is that whereas the gender difference in incidence of MI would suggest that testosterone promotes and/or estrogen prevents MI, the cross- sectional, hormone administration, and prospective studies have suggested that in men testosterone may prevent and estrogen promote MI. These studies have thus revealed an estrogen-androgen paradox: that endogenous sex hormones may relate both to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its risk factors oppositely in women and men. Recently recognized experiments of nature and their knockout mouse models may present another manifestation of this estrogen-androgen paradox and could help resolve these apparent contradictions."

However, the findings were inconsistent across studies. These inconsistent findings could be attributable to methodological issues such as collecting data from medical records, small sample sizes, and controversial eligibility criteria for studies. More studies are needed to confirm gender differences in symptom experiences of AMI."

Follow-up events were cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).Dobutamine stress echocardiography was normal in 687 men (30%) and 483 women (44%) (p <0.0001). Ischemia on DSE was present in 1,194 men (52%) and 416 women (38%) (p <0.001). During a mean follow-up of 7 +/- 3.4 years, there were 894 (26%) deaths (442 attributed to cardiac causes) and 145 (4%) nonfatal MIs. The annual cardiac event rate was 2.5% in men and 1.2% in women with normal DSE. Independent predictors of cardiac events in patients with normal DSE using a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were male gender (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.7 [range 1.1 to 2.8]), age (HR: 1.02 [range 1.01 to 1.04]), history of heart failure (HR: 3.4 [range 1.5 to 7.9]), previous MI (HR: 1.7 [range 1.1 to 2.8]), and diabetes (HR: 2.4 [range 1.3 to 4.5]). Independent predictors of cardiac events in patients with an abnormal DSE were age (HR: 1.03 [range 1.02 to 1.04]), history of heart failure (HR: 1.7 [range 1.3 to 2.1]), diabetes (HR: 1.4 [range 1.1 to 1.8]), heart rate at rest (HR: 2.8 [range 1.4 to 5.8]), wall motion abnormalities at rest (HR: 1.06 [range 1.04 to 1.09]), and ischemia on DSE (HR: 1.04 [range 1.02 to 1.07]). Myocardial ischemia was an independent predictor of cardiac events in both men and women.Dobutamine stress echocardiography provides independent prognostic information in both men and women. In patients with normal DSE, gender is independently associated with cardiac events. The outcome of patients with abnormal DSE is not related to gender, after adjusting for stress echocardiographic abnormalities."

Initial symptom experience was similar for men and women: both were most commonly at home when symptoms began; both were most commonly in the presence of their spouse or other family member; few patients (<10%) called the emergency medical system as their first reaction. Several factors contributed similarly to delay in men and women. Factors that exerted a differential effect on delay between men and women were age, history of AMI, type of AMI (Q-wave and non-Q-wave), concerns about not wanting to trouble others, and prior knowledge of thrombolytics. There was no difference in delay between men and women (median 3.08 versus 3.10 h), but there are important gender differences in the reasons patients delay and in their patterns of decision-making that may assist clinicians trying to tailor interventions."

We have examined the natural history, histopathology and myocardial mechanical strength in mice with AMI.AMI was induced by coronary artery occlusion and animals were monitored for fatal events. Gross and histological examinations were undertaken.Rupture occurred in the left ventricular free wall at 2-6 days after AMI. Incidence of rupture in male mice varied among three strains studied (3% for FVB/N, 27% for C57B/6J, and 59% for 129sv, P<0.05) and was lower in female than male mice (23% vs. 59%, P<0.05). Histologically, ruptured hearts had rapid-occurring and severe infarct expansion, multifocal intramural hemorrhage and leucoyte infiltration at the border zone and infarcted zone. In vitro, infarcted left ventricles demonstrated a 50-60% reduction in muscle tensile strength. This reduction preceded the onset of rupture and was related to the time-window of rupture and to infarct size.LV wall rupture in the mouse occurs within a narrow time-window after AMI and is strain- and gender-dependent. Infarct expansion, regional hemorrhage with formation of hematoma and leuocyte accumulation are important pathological changes leading to reduced myocardial tensile strength."

The purpose of the present study was to explore the specific role for activation of the AT 1a R subtype in post-MI remodeling and whether gender differences exist in the patterns of remodeling in wild-type and AT 1a R knockout (KO) mice. AT 1a R-KO mice and wild-type littermates underwent coronary ligation to induce MI or sham procedures; echocardiography and hemodynamic evaluation were performed 6 wk later, and LV tissue was harvested for infarct size determination, morphometric measurements, and gene expression analysis. Survival and infarct size were similar among all male and female wild-type and AT 1a R-KO mice. Hemodynamic indexes were also similar except for lower systolic blood pressure in the AT 1a R-KO mice compared with wild-type mice. Male and female wild-type and male AT 1a R-KO mice developed similar increases in LV chamber size, LV mass corrected for body weight (LV/BW), and myocyte cross-sectional area (CSA). However, female AT 1a R-KO mice demonstrated no increase in LV/BW and myocyte CSA post-MI compared with shams. Both male and female wild-type mice demonstrated higher atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels after MI, with female wild types being significantly greater than males. However, male and female AT 1a R-KO mice developed no increase in ANP gene expression with MI despite an increase in LV mass and myocyte size in males. These data support that gender-specific patterns of LV and myocyte hypertrophy exist after MI in mice with a disrupted AT 1a R gene, and suggest that myocyte hypertrophy post-MI in females relies, in part, on activation of the AT 1a R. Further work is necessary to explore the potential mechanisms underlying these gender-based differences."

Whether contemporary interventional treatment strategies have improved outcomes for women compared with men is unknown.In the CADILLAC trial, 2082 patients (27% women) with AMI within 12 hours of symptom onset were randomized to balloon angioplasty (PTCA; n=518), PTCA+abciximab (n=528), stenting (n=512), and stenting+abciximab (n=524). As compared with men, women had a lower body surface area; had a greater prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia; experienced significant delays to treatment; and had better baseline and final TIMI grade 3 flows. Unadjusted 1-year event rates were higher for women, including death (7.6% versus 3.0%, P<0.001), ischemic target-vessel revascularization (TVR; 16.7% versus 12.1%, P=0.006), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE; 23.9% versus 15.3%, P<0.001). Female gender was an independent predictor of MACE and bleeding complications, although comorbid risk factors and body surface area but not gender predicted 1-year death. For women, primary stenting resulted in a reduction in 1-year MACE from 28.1% to 19.1% (P=0.01) and in ischemic TVR from 20.4% to 10.8% (P=0.002) compared with PTCA. The addition of abciximab to primary stenting significantly reduced the 30-day ischemic TVR without increasing bleeding or stroke rates.The higher mortality rate in women compared with men after interventional treatment for AMI may be explained by differences in body size and clinical risk factors, although female gender remains an important independent determinant of overall adverse outcomes. For women in the CADILLAC trial, the addition of abciximab reduced 30-day TVR without increasing bleeding risk, and primary stenting reduced 1-year TVR and MACE rates compared with PTCA."

We subjected male and female rats to 0 (Sed; n = 8 males and 8 females), 1 (1 day; n = 10 males and 8 females), or 5 (5 day; n = 6 males and 6 females) days of treadmill running. Langendorff-perfused hearts underwent 1 h of regional ischaemia and 2 h of reperfusion, and infarct size (expressed as a percentage of the zone at risk; ZAR), left ventricular pressure development, and coronary flow were measured for each heart. Preischaemic pressure development and coronary flow did not differ between the sexes nor were they influenced by exercise. Sed females had significantly smaller infarct sizes (25 +/- 3%) than Sed male hearts (37 +/- 3%; P < 0.001). Short-term running significantly reduced infarct size following 1 day (27 +/- 3%; P < 0.05) and 5 days (30 +/- 4%; P < 0.10) of exercise in males. One day of running did not reduce infarct size in females (19 +/- 3%; P = NS), but 5 day females did show a significant reduction in infarct size (13 +/- 2%; P < 0.05). There was no relationship between postischaemic coronary vascular hyperaemia and infarct size across sexes or exercise training groups. Hearts from Sed females exhibited significantly higher manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protein expression than hearts from Sed males, but short-term exercise (neither 1 nor 5 days) did not alter MnSOD protein in either sex. Increased sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel subunit protein expression (SUR2A and/or K(ir)6.2) correlated closely with sex-dependent and exercise-acquired protection against myocardial infarction. These data indicate that: (1) sex-dependent and exercise-induced differences in the susceptibility of the heart to ischaemia-reperfusion injury are not associated with improved coronary flow or postischaemic hyperaemia; (2) increased MnSOD protein expression is not necessary for exercise-induced protection from infarction; and (3) one possible mechanism for sex-dependent and exercise-mediated reductions in infarct size involves an increased protein expression of cardiac sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels."

Gender syntony was defined as a match between patient gender (BSRI) and the perceived gender of the treatment environment (WAS).Women experienced higher levels of distress than men and were more likely to experience discordance between their gender and the perceived gender of the care environment (73% of women versus 32% of men). The presence of gender dystony (a mismatch between gender and treatment environment) was related to higher levels of illness intrusiveness and overall distress.Modification of the heart disease treatment environment so that it better meets the needs of women may reduce sex differences in distress."

The aim of this research was to explore the illness perceptions of a sample of women following acute myocardial infarction (MI). Relationships between illness perceptions and adoption of health-promoting behaviours, and attendance at a programme of cardiac rehabilitation were explored. The influence of age was also considered. Leventhal and Nerenz' Self- Regulatory Model of Illness Behaviour (1985) was used as the theoretical framework. This model consists of three stages: interpretation of symptoms, coping and appraisal. A qualitative research design was used. A purposeful sample of 10 women was selected on the basis of age and decision to attend cardiac rehabilitation. Data were collected by semi-structured interview, 3 months following the acute infarct, and analysed thematically. Stress was considered to be the cause of the MI, and although lifestyle factors were recognized, their significance was uncertain; perhaps as a result, lifestyle changes were limited. Overall, women had a perceived lack of control over the illness. The decision to attend a cardiac rehabilitation programme was influenced by beliefs relating to the identification of a known cause and level of perceived control of the illness. A belief that the illness was inevitable seemed to be more prevalent in older aged women. These findings have implications for health service providers in that they suggest that illness perceptions need to be explored and addressed before the decision to attend a programme of cardiac rehabilitation is made and health-promoting behaviours adopted."

Using a mouse model of MI, we recently found that the cardiac rupture rate during the first week after MI was significantly lower in females than in males, suggesting that females have attenuated structural remodeling. Thus in this study, we attempted to determine whether: a) females have attenuated remodeling and faster healing during the early phase post-MI, and b) females have better cardiac function and outcome during the chronic phase compared to males. MI was induced in 12-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice. Signs of early remodeling, including cardiac rupture, infarct expansion, inflammatory response, and collagen deposition, were studied during the first 2 weeks post-MI. Left ventricular remodeling and function were followed for 12 weeks post-MI. We found that males had a higher rate of cardiac rupture, occurring mainly at 3 to 5 days of MI and associated with a higher infarct expansion index. Neutrophil infiltration at the infarct border was more pronounced in males than females during the first days of MI, which were also characterized by increased MMP activity. However, the number of infiltrating macrophages was significantly higher in females at day 4. During the chronic phase post-MI, males had significantly poorer LV function, more prominent dilatation and significant myocyte hypertrophy compared to females. In conclusion, males have delayed myocardial healing, resulting in cardiac rupture, and the survivors have poorer cardiac function and pronounced maladaptive remodeling, whereas females show a better outcome during the development of HF."

Data were analysed for differences in treatment between men and women and whether these could be attributed to age at presentation.Women were older than men at presentation [mean age 75 (SD 11) versus 66 (12) years, p < 0.01]; fewer women received thrombolysis (34 versus 44 per cent) and low molecular weight heparin (63 versus 71 per cent) (both p < 0.001); and women had higher 30 day mortality (28 versus 17 per cent, p < 0.001). Fewer women received cardiac catheterization, investigations to identify high risk, drugs for secondary prevention on discharge and referral to cardiac rehabilitation. However, intensities of treatment, investigation and secondary prevention were strongly related to age and, after adjusting for age, gender differences remained only for thrombolysis and exercise testing.Although women receive fewer investigations and treatments than men, this potential gender bias can be explained by age. The lower use of treatment and investigation among older patients draws attention to the lack of direct evidence of effectiveness for these patients. Further studies are needed to confirm effectiveness of investigations and treatments in older patients."

The authors found evidence for the sex difference in the effect of the ACE-DD genotype on MI risk. The ACE-DD genotype conferred a 2-fold independent risk for premature MI in males."

Age adjusted 28 day case fatality was greater in women (51.5% v 38.6%, p < 0.001), with a larger sex difference evident among younger Malay patients. This inequality between the sexes was observed in both the pre-hospitalisation and post-admission periods. Among hospitalised patients, women were older, were less likely to have suffered from a previous Q wave or anterior wall myocardial infarction, and had lower peak creatine kinase concentrations. Case fatality was higher among women, with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43 to 1.88) and 1.50 (95% CI 1.37 to 1.64) for 28 day and mean four year follow up periods. There were significant interactions of sex and age with ethnic group (p = 0.017). The adjusted hazards for mortality among Chinese, Indian, and Malay women versus men were 1.30, 1.71, and 1.96, respectively. The excess mortality among women diminished with age.In this multiethnic population, both pre-hospitalisation and post-admission case fatality rates were substantially higher among women.

A standardized, detailed chart review was conducted. Information collected from the medical charts included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, comorbid conditions, and cardiovascular medication use during hospitalization and at discharge.Similar proportions of female and male patients were treated with thrombolytics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, nitrate, heparin, diuretics and digoxin. Among patients aged 75 years and over, a smaller proportion of female patients received acetylsalicylic acid in hospital than did male patients (87% versus 95%; P=0.026). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that, after correction for age, use of other anticoagulants/antiplatelets and death within 24 h of admission, sex was no longer an independent predictor for receipt of acetylsalicylic acid in hospital. Medications prescribed at discharge were similar between male and female patients.The results from this Canadian chart review study, derived from detailed clinical data, indicate that the pattern of pharmacological treatment of female and male AMI patients during hospitalization and at discharge was very similar.

Eighty-one men and 67 women completed the follow-up questionnaire 1-year postcardiac event. The questionnaire included measures of illness intrusiveness in three life domains, depressive symptomatology, social support, medical information, risk factors for heart disease, and sociodemographic information.A MANCOVA with the three Illness Intrusiveness subscales as dependent variables, sex as the between-group factor, and partnership status as a covariate found a sex effect for the Intimacy subscale, but not for the Instrumental and the Relationships/Personal Development subscales. Men reported more intrusiveness in the Intimacy domain of their life as compared to women. After controlling for sociodemographic factors and risk factors for heart disease, hierarchical regressions indicated sex differences in baseline predictors of 1-year follow-up illness intrusiveness in the three life domains. For men, being satisfied with support from partner at baseline was associated with less intrusiveness in the Instrumental Life domain 1 year after the cardiac event. For women, surprisingly, more satisfaction with support from their partner at baseline was associated with more intrusiveness in their intimate lives 1 year after their cardiac event. In addition, emotional symptoms of depression at baseline were predictive of increased illness intrusiveness in Relationship/Personal Development and Intimacy domains for men and in Instrumental and Intimacy domains for women.Support from partner may have a differential impact for men and women after a cardiac event. Depressive symptomatology during initial hospitalization, particularly emotional symptoms, is a prominent indicator of illness intrusiveness for both sexes 1 year after the cardiac event."

The diabetes-related hazard ratio for a major CHD event from the Cox model, adjusted for age and area of residence, was 2.9 (95% CI 2.2-3.9) in men and 14.4 (8.4-24.5) in women, and after further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, 2.8 (2.0-3.7) and 9.5 (5.5-16.9), respectively. The burden of conventional risk factors in the presence of diabetes was greater in women than in men at baseline. Prospectively, elevated blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol, and high triglycerides contributed to diabetes-related CHD risk more in women than in men. However, after adjusting for conventional risk factors, a substantial proportion of diabetes-related CHD risk remained unexplained in both genders.The stronger effect of type 2 diabetes on the risk of CHD in women compared with men was in part explained by a heavier risk factor burden and a greater effect of blood pressure and atherogenic dyslipidemia in diabetic women."

Demographic factors, clinical symptoms and presence of risk factors for CAD were recorded with the help of pre-tested data extraction forms.Young patients represented 16.1% of all patients with AMI. 93.1% of the young patients were men. Young male patients were more likely to be smokers and have high cholesterol levels as compared to their young female counterparts. Young AMI patients when compared to old AMI patients, were more likely to have hypertension, positive family history of coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, high LDL and high triglycerides.In this study, the risk factor profile between young and old patients and between the two genders was found to be different. Thus adult management protocols for AMI should be different from the ones for older patients and gender difference should also be considered."

Subjects were all patients admitted with ischaemic heart disease with or without congestive heart failure between 15 October 1997 and 14 October 1999. The main measure was the previous outpatient use of recommended medications. Chi-square analyses followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine age-sex differences.Usage of recommended medications varied from approximately 60% for beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to 90% for antihypertensive agents. Patients aged 75 and over were significantly less likely than younger patients to be taking any of the medication classes. Following adjustment for age, there were no significant differences in medication use by sex except among women aged 75 and older who were more likely to be taking beta-blockers than men in the same age group.The use of evidence-based cardiovascular medications is rising and perhaps approaching reasonable levels for some drug classes.

Men who were abstainers during the previous 1-10 years and with an earlier average consumption of 5-30 g 100% ethanol/day had a significantly lower relative risk compared to such abstainers with an earlier higher consumption. Earlier consumption among abstainers may also have an impact on gender differences in MI. Analyses showed positive interaction between abstention and low life-control in women, but only 4% of the female cases were due to this interaction. There were no other interactions between measures of alcohol use and social anchorage, life control and working situations.Alcohol use had a protective impact on MI, with little impact of job strain, social anchorage and life control, giving increased support for a protective impact of low-moderate alcohol use.

Research has shown a gap in the utilization of medical therapy, diagnostic studies, and revascularization procedures involving women. In addition, women s outcomes after myocardial infarction have been consistently demonstrated to be poorer than those of men. Another important issue that has just started to be addressed is that the predominantly male-focused cardiovascular research has been generalized to women.

However, to our knowledge, no prior population-based studies have examined both cohorts simultaneously to explain this intriguing variation. Hence, we undertook to explore and explain sex differences in 5-year mortality after UA and AMI.We used an administrative database of 22 967 patients with AMI and 8441 patients with UA discharged from acute care hospitals in Alberta between April 1, 1993, and March 31, 2000.Women were older with more baseline comorbidities, more frequently had a diagnosis of UA, and had 30% lower relative odds of undergoing revascularization than men. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 5-year mortality were similar between sexes after UA (women vs men, 21.6% vs 19.5%; P =.09) but markedly higher for women after AMI (38.5% vs 26.6%, P<.001). After adjustment for baseline characteristics and revascularization, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for women vs men were 0.81 (0.72-0.92) after UA and 0.99 (0.93-1.05) after AMI. Only women younger than 65 years were at a significantly higher risk after AMI. The reasons for this difference in sex-related outcomes between UA and AMI may relate to greater disparities in the AMI cohort with respect to age, comorbidities, neighborhood incomes, and referrals to cardiovascular specialists.Relative to UA, AMI has a more serious impact on women than men, such that women have a survival advantage when afflicted with UA but lose that advantage with AMI. Additional investigation into the causes, treatment, and policy implications of the age-sex interaction is warranted."

The objectives of our multi-hospital observational study were to examine sex differences and temporal trends (1975-99) in hospital and long-term case-fatality rates (CFRs) in patients with diabetes mellitus and AMI from a population-based perspective.A community-wide study of residents of the Worcester, Mass, metropolitan area who were hospitalized with confirmed AMI was conducted. Data were collected in 12 1-year periods between 1975 and 1999. The study sample consisted of 1354 men and 1280 women with diabetes mellitus.Overall hospital CFRs were significantly greater for women with diabetes mellitus (21.3%) than for men with diabetes mellitus (14.9%). Between 1975 and 1999, hospital CFRs declined from 39.2% to 17.5% for women and from 18.9% to 9.5% in men. In examining long-term survival patterns for as long as 10 years after hospital discharge, there were no significant sex differences in long-term survival rates after adjustment for a limited number of known potentially confounding factors.Hospital death rates after AMI in men and women with diabetes mellitus have declined in the last 2 decades. The gap in hospital CFRs between men and women with diabetes mellitus has decreased considerably with time, although women have a higher risk of dying after AMI than men. Patients with diabetes mellitus continue to represent a high-risk group who will benefit from enhanced surveillance efforts and increased use of effective cardiac treatments."

Epidemiologic and animal studies have suggested that women undergo differing patterns of LV remodeling than men after myocardial infarction (MI). We, therefore, sought to compare LV remodeling after MI in male and female mice. Echocardiography was performed in male and female C57BL6 mice before and serially after MI. Two days after MI, end-diastolic LV internal diameter and shortening fraction were similar in males and females. Between days 2 and 28 after MI, LV internal diameter increased in male mice but remained unchanged in female mice. During this time period, shortening fraction declined in males, but not in females. Posterior wall thickness increased more in females than in males. The size of the MI and the LV mass/body weight were similar between the 2 sexes after MI. Echocardiography showed that after MI, female mice undergo less extensive LV remodeling than males, with less dilation and better preserved LV systolic function 28 days after MI. These sex differences should be taken into account when studying murine cardiac adaptation to MI."

These slight sex differences noted in the APPROACH registry are similar to previously reported findings and may be clinically important."

No review has been found which focuses on gender differences in coping and social support in myocardial infarction patients.A computerized search was conducted using the keywords 'myocardial infarction', 'coping', 'gender differences' and 'social support'. Forty-one articles, published between 1990 and October 2002, were scrutinized.Two studies report that women used more coping strategies than men. Several qualitative studies found that women used a variety of coping strategies. Women minimized the impact of the disease, tended to delay in seeking treatment and did not want to bother others with their health problems. Household activities were important to them and aided their recovery. Men were more likely to involve their spouses in their recovery, and resuming work and keeping physically fit were important to them. Women tended to report that they had less social support up to 1 year after a myocardial infarction compared with men. They received less information about the disease and rehabilitation and experienced lack of belief in their heart problems from caregivers. Further, they received less assistance with household duties from informal caregivers. Men tended to report more support from their spouses than did women.Traditional gender-role patterns may influence the recovery of patients who have experienced myocardial infarction. Caregivers may need to be more sensitive to gender-specific needs with regard to risk profiles, social roles, and the patient's own role identity. For many women, especially older ones, household duties and family responsibilities may be an opportunity and a base for cardiac rehabilitation."

Four age groups (<55, 55 to 64, 65 to 74 and >or=75 years) of men and women were studied.Use of echocardiography, exercise treadmill testing (ETT), cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) during the index hospitalization was examined in relation to age and gender. Overall, women were less likely to undergo ETT, cardiac catheterization, and CABG than were men, and these trends remained after controlling for potentially confounding factors. Between 1990 and 1999, there was a dramatic decrease in ETT, whereas the use of echocardiography remained unchanged. There were marked increases over time in the use of cardiac catheterization and PCI in women and men. Use of cardiac catheterization and PCI increased to a greater extent in women as compared to men. In patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, rates of coronary revascularization were similar between men and women.Our data suggest that women and men with AMI are treated differently with respect to use of diagnostic and revascularization procedures. However, gender differences in the use of these diagnostic and interventional approaches have narrowed over time."

This difference disappears in the post-fertile years, and is presumably related to the reduced levels of female sex hormones, with subsequent metabolic and hemodynamic modifications. Ovarian exhaustion induces a more atherogenic lipid profile, which may partly explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease observed in post-fertile women as compared to age-matched fertile women. After the menopause, the combination of aging and estrogen deficiency negatively affects glucose metabolism. Diabetes mellitus blunts the beneficial condition associated with the female gender; furthermore, it increases the incidence of myocardial infarction, claudication and stroke in women more than in men. Finally, the unfavorable effects of menopause on the coronary risk seem to be mediated partly by changes in clotting and fibrinolytic factors."

Women with reinfarction were older and more often had hypertension, diabetes, and major bleeding prior to reinfarction. Despite adjustment for these differences, women with reinfarction were less likely to receive repeat fibrinolytic therapy (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37-0.84). Aggressive treatment by either repeat fibrinolysis or urgent revascularization was associated with reduced 1-year mortality irrespective of gender. Death within 24 h of reinfarction was more frequent in women and accounted for a greater proportion of their 1-year mortality (56.0 vs 34.8%; p=0.02). The excess mortality in women at 1 year (27.3 vs 19.9%; p=0.045) was eliminated after adjustment for gender differences in baseline risk profile.Women with early reinfarction following fibrinolysis for AMI had more frequent early death and were managed less aggressively.

If clinicians can identify patients at greatest risk for anxiety after AMI, they can institute early treatment. Previous research on the influence of gender on the incidence of anxiety post-AMI reflects inconsistent findings, and differences across cultures have not been studied. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to determine: 1) whether there are gender differences in anxiety in a diverse international sample of AMI patients, and 2) whether there was an interaction between gender and sociodemographic and clinical variables thought to influence anxiety.In this prospective, comparative study, 912 AMI patients were enrolled from Australia, South Korea, Japan, England, and the United States. Anxiety was assessed, using the Brief Symptom Inventory, within the first 72 hours of admission to the hospital for AMI symptoms.Women had higher anxiety levels than men (0.76 +/- 0.90 vs. 0.57 +/- 0.70, p =.005), and this pattern of higher anxiety in women was seen in each country studied. Neither sociodemographic nor clinical variables interacted with gender to influence anxiety.Across a variety of cultures, women have higher anxiety than men after AMI and this relationship is independent of age, education level, marital status, or presence of comorbidities or severity of AMI."

Recently, it was reported that TCRT differed significantly between healthy men and women, which suggested that its predictive power might be gender dependent. The aim of the study was to investigate TCRT and its association with cardiac mortality in male and female survivors of acute MI. TCRT was measured from digital Frank orthogonal XYZ-lead ECGs recorded before hospital discharge in 681 survivors of acute MI (82% men, age: men 57.0 +/- 8.4 years, women 59.6 +/- 8.1 years, P = 0.002). During a follow-up censored at 5 years, cardiac mortality rates were 9.7% and 12.1% in men and women, respectively (P = 0.42). There were no significant difference in TCRT between men and women (-0.150 +/- 0.704 vs -0.070 +/- 0.731, P = 0.26). In univariate Cox regression analysis, TCRT < -0.88 was related to a 5-year cardiac mortality in men (relative risk [RR] 3.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.13-6.34, P = 1.9 x 10(-6)), and women (RR 5.16, 95% CI 1.83-14.56, P = 0.0015). Depressed TCRT was strongly associated with increased long-term cardiac mortality in survivors of acute MI. Its predictive power did not differ significantly between the sexes. The role of TCRT as a risk-stratifier in post-MI patients deserves further prospective assessment in multivariate models with established risk factors."

These data however do not take into account the pre-hospital period. Indeed, three large WHO MONICA reports that included out-of-hospital events found no significant gender difference in overall 28-day mortality from MI, with more men dying before reaching the hospital (presumably of ventricular tachyarrhythmias) and more women dying after hospital admission (presumably of heart failure). Women compared to men exhibit enhanced vagal activity, both under basal conditions and during angioplasty-induced coronary occlusion, and this may afford protection against malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Epidemiological data indicate that women dying of ischemic heart disease are less prone to sudden death than men. Taken together, the above findings suggest that, following acute MI, significant gender differences lie not so much in overall mortality, but in the timing and mechanisms of death."

Many of these differences have been explained by the presence of more comorbidities and worse clinical characteristics such as older age, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension in women than in men. Moreover, women have a smaller vessel diameter, more coronary tortuosity and different plaque composition compared to men that can lead to a higher dissection rate and a greater number of procedural complications. Although early data on PTCA suggested worse immediate results in women than in men, more recent data suggest that this difference is less marked. The introduction of stents with a low profile and a higher tractability and pushability has allowed the extensive application of these devices even in small and tortuous vessels improving the outcome of PTCA. This improvement has been higher in women than in men leading to the equalization of the immediate outcome in the two sexes, even if the baseline characteristics remain worse in women. In particular, mortality and the need for urgent surgical revascularization have become extremely low without any differences between sexes. However, some authors have still found a higher incidence of complications in the first period after the procedure due to stent thrombosis in the stenting era. For this reason, meticulous antiplatelet treatment should be prescribed and drugs such as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may also be considered advisable to reduce the excess risk in the female population particularly in women with prothrombotic risk factors such as diabetes. At 6 and 12 months similar rates of death, late myocardial infarction, and repeated revascularization have been shown in the two sexes. Coronary stenting and the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have also improved the immediate results in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing primary PTCA. Studies comparing the outcome differences between women and men with AMI and treated with primary PTCA are limited but all suggest that women benefit more than men from this procedure. The in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI is significantly higher in the female than in the male population with a higher incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in women among tissue-type plasminogen activator-treated patients. Vice versa, women and men have a similar or a slightly higher in-hospital mortality after primary PTCA without intracranial bleeding complications. For this reason, an earlier diagnosis of AMI, an earlier hospital admission and an earlier primary PTCA should be the aims of management in order to improve the outcome in women with AMI and to equalize the procedural results in the two sexes."

The results of a multivariable regression analysis indicated that women were significantly less likely to receive aspirin and ACE inhibitors as compared to men. There were no significant gender differences in the prescribing of the other cardiac medications. Increasing age in both women and men was associated with a reduced likelihood of receiving effective cardiac therapies including aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering therapy and thrombolytic agents.These data suggest that the reasons for the marked age-related differences, in men and women, in the use of cardiac medications be more systematically explored.

To extend our earlier observation of an association between the ACE DD genotype in African-American males and venous thrombosis, other genes in the renin-angiotensin pathway were investigated for possible disease association and were compared with African-Americans with myocardial infarction. African-American patients with a documented history of venous thrombosis or a history of myocardial infarction were eligible for participation as cases in the study. Control subjects were African-American outpatients attending a clinical laboratory for routine blood tests who had comparable age and gender distributions to the cases. Persons with a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or thrombosis were excluded. Genes that were analyzed for known polymorphisms included angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and the angiotensin II type I receptor. Our results showed that the ACE DD genotype was also associated with MI in African-American males but not in females. Racial/ethnic and sex differences were also found with respect to the genotype distribution of the ACE 4656(CT)(2/3) polymorphism. It was observed that the 2/2 genotype had a protective effective in males for myocardial infarction and venous thrombosis. The data also demonstrated that the allele frequencies of the A1166C variant of the angiotensin II type I receptor were different in African-Americans as compared to Caucasians."

In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, the relative risks of mortality in men who had an HR of 80 beats/min or more were 3.1 (CI=1.4 to 7.0, P=0.003) on the first day, 4.1 (CI=1.8 to 9.8, P=0.001) on the third day and 8.6 (CI=2.9 to 27.0, P<0.0001) on the seventh day. In the 203 men in whom echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction was measured, an interactive effect of high HR with depressed ejection fraction on mortality was found. Beta-blocking therapy influenced HR during AMI but did not influence the HR-mortality association.The results of the present prospective study show that HR measured during the first week after admission for AMI is an important predictor of mortality in men. The predictive power of HR increased from the first to the seventh day after AMI."

For approximately three months a year, data were also collected for all AMI cases above the age of 64 years (group B). There were 13,048 and 4,425 cases in groups A and B respectively.In age - standardised AMI rates, males outnumbered females by a factor of 4.0 and 1.7 for groups A and B respectively.The median age of presentation was higher in females for both age groups being 58 years versus 54 years for group A and 75 years versus 72 years for group B. Younger females had worse survival at 28 days and were more likely to have prior ischaemic heart disease and require resuscitation. They were also more likely to have atypical symptoms. Previous myocardial infarction was not different between the sexes in both groups. Among the older age group, there was no gender difference in prior ischaemic heart disease, 28-day survival and requirement for resuscitation.Women who have AMI tend to be older than men. Gender differences are age-specific. Women who are 64 years and below have more atypical symptoms, prior ischaemic heart disease and worse prognosis than men after AMI. These differences are not seen in those over the age of 64."

Younger but not older women hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction have higher in-hospital mortality rates than men. We hypothesized that younger women also have higher in-hospital mortality rates after CABG.We studied 51 187 patients (30% women) included in the National Cardiovascular Network database who received CABG at 23 clinical centers between October 1993 and December 1999. Compared with men, fewer women were white and more women had risk factors and comorbidities. These differences were more apparent in younger patients. In all age groups, however, women had higher left ventricular ejection fraction and fewer diseased vessels. Women had higher in-hospital mortality rates than men, but sex differences in mortality were more marked among younger patients. Women <50 years of age were 3 times more likely to die than men (3.4% versus 1.1%), and women 50 to 59 years of age were 2.4 times more likely to die than men (2.6% versus 1.1%). In the older age categories, the sex difference in in-hospital mortality was less marked (P<0.001 for the interaction between sex and age). Adjustment for preoperative risk factors only slightly decreased the strength of this interaction.Younger women undergoing CABG surgery are at a higher risk of in-hospital death than men, but this difference in risk decreases with advancing age. Additional investigation is needed to determine why in-hospital mortality is higher in women after CABG, with particular focus on younger women."

On admission, a higher proportion of men with definite AMI had chest pain or ECG changes typical for AMI (P < 0.0001). Disagreement between clinical diagnosis and classification by MONICA criteria occurred more often in women (P=0.008). A significantly higher proportion of men was admitted in the coronary care unit and they were significantly more often treated with thrombolytics, nitroglycerine, beta-blockers, or antiplatelet agents. Women received significantly more diuretics, inotropics or calcium antagonists. Diabetes, conferring a worse prognosis, was more common in women (20 vs. 15%; P=0.003). Prehospital CF was significantly higher in men (24.1 vs. 18.3%; P=0.005), but in patients treated in hospital, the CF was significantly lower in men (12.7 vs. 21.2%; P < 0.001). Total CF was equal in men and women.Several factors contributing to the excess in-hospital CF in women were identified, including greater problems in diagnosis of AMI in women which may be one of the reasons for less intensive treatment in women. Differences in co-morbidity, most notably diabetes and medical treatment between men and women with acute AMI may also have played a part."

Another objective was to evaluate the association of age, gender and treatment intensity with five-year survival after AMI.Utilization rates of specialized cardiac services inversely correlate with age. Gender-specific practice patterns may also vary with age in a manner similar to known age-gender survival differences after AMI.Using linked population-based administrative data, we examined the association of age and gender with treatment intensity and long-term survival among 25,697 patients hospitalized with AMI in Ontario between April 1, 1992, and December 31, 1993. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust for socioeconomic status, illness severity, attending physician specialty and admitting hospital characteristics.After adjusting for baseline differences, the relative rates of angiography and follow-up specialist care for women relative to men, respectively, fell 17.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.6 to 21.3, p < 0.001) and 10.2% (95% CI, 7.1 to 13.2, p < 0.001) for every 10-year increase in age. Conversely, long-term AMI survival rates in women relative to men improved with increasing age, such that the relative survival in women rose 14.2% (95% CI, 10.1 to 17.5, p < 0.001) for every 10-year age increase.Gender differences in the intensity of invasive testing and follow-up care are strongly age-specific. While care becomes progressively less aggressive among older women relative to men, survival advantages track in the opposite direction, with older women clearly favored. These findings suggest that biology is likely to remain the main determinant of long-term survival after AMI for women."

Identification of gender differences has implications for both health care providers and the general public. Women should be instructed as to the symptoms expected with ACS on the basis of evidence obtained from studies that include both sexes. Twelve studies that identified symptoms of ACS for both women and men were identified through a review of the literature. In several of the studies, which included all types of ACS, women had significantly more back and jaw pain, nausea and/or vomiting, dyspnea, indigestion, and palpitations. In a number of the studies, which solely sampled patients with acute myocardial infarction, women demonstrated more back, jaw, and neck pain; nausea and/or vomiting; dyspnea; palpitations; indigestion; dizziness; fatigue; loss of appetite; and syncope. Men reported more chest pain and diaphoresis in the myocardial infarction sample. Results of these studies showed that women and men experienced the same symptoms with ACS. However, in some studies there were gender differences in the proportion of symptoms. Given the current state of the science, definitive conclusions regarding gender differences in the symptoms of ACS cannot be drawn. Further study is urgently needed to clarify and expand on these findings."

End points included referral for coronary angiography, death, and cardiac events, defined as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure.A total of 2276 men and 1270 women under went stress tests. Women were older and had more risk factors and comorbidities (P < .05). Among persons without documented CAD (86% of the cohort), the median probability of CAD was 11% (interquartile range, 5%-25%) for men and 8% (interquartile range, 2%-31%) for women (P < .001). Within 6 months after stress testing, 9% of men and 7% of women underwent coronary angiography. Among persons without documented CAD, there was no sex difference in referral for angiography when the stress test result was negative. When the test result was positive, men were more likely to be referred for angiography (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for male sex, 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-3.38; P = .008). After adjusting for the predicted probability of CAD, this association was no longer detected (adjusted OR for male sex, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.26-1.73; P = .41). Among persons with documented CAD, no sex difference was noted. After a mean +/- SD follow-up of 7.6 +/- 2.7 years and among persons without documented CAD, male sex was associated with a higher adjusted risk of death (relative risk for male sex, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05-1.86; P = .02) and cardiac events (relative risk for male sex, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.24-2.26; P < .001). Among persons with documented CAD, no sex difference in outcome was noted.These population-based data indicate that, when the diagnosis of CAD was not established, there was a greater use of angiography among men with positive stress test results, which could be attributed to the increased probability of CAD in men. In the absence of documented CAD, men fared worse than women, with an increase in the risk of death and cardiac events. Among persons with documented CAD, no sex difference in use of angiography and outcome was noted."

There was a total of 482 patients (136 females [28%], 346 males [72%]) admitted consecutively with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction between July, 1995 and June, 1996.Female patients were older and had more comorbid diseases than male patients. Female patients also tended to have more cardiac complications during hospitalization and a greater 30-day mortality (10% vs 4%, P <.05). After adjustment for baseline characteristics and age/sex interaction, it was found that female patients were less likely to undergo thrombolytic therapy, cardiac catheterization, or revascularization, and they had a greater 30-day mortality. These sex differences in cardiac catheterization and revascularization were more pronounced for older patients. On the other hand, the sex differences in 30-day mortality were greater for younger patients.Our data suggest that cardiac catheterization, revascularization and 30-day mortality may have been related to patient sex and age, but further study is needed."

We did a meta-analysis of all large randomised trials designed to study the clinical efficacy and safety of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with acute coronary syndromes who were not routinely scheduled to undergo early coronary revascularisation.Inclusion criteria were: randomisation of patients with acute coronary syndromes but without persistent ST elevation; comparison of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor with placebo or control therapy; non-recommendation of early coronary revascularisation during study-drug infusion; and enrollment of at least 1000 patients. Data on individual patients were obtained from all participants in these trials.Six trials, enrolling 31402 patients, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 30 days after randomisation, 3530 (11.2%) patients died or developed a myocardial infarction. At 30 days, a 9% reduction in the odds of death or myocardial infarction was seen with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors compared with placebo or control (10.8% [1980/18297] vs 11.8% [1550/13105] events; odds ratio 0.91 [95% CI 0.84-0.98]; p=0.015). The relative treatment benefit was similar in subgroups of patients according to important clinical baseline characteristics; hence, the absolute treatment benefit was largest in high-risk patients. An unexpected and significant interaction was seen between sex and allocated treatment, with a treatment benefit in men (0.81 [0.75-0.89] but not in women (1.15 [1.01-1.30]). However, once patients were stratified according to troponin concentration, there was no evidence of a sex difference in treatment response, and a risk reduction was seen in men and women with raised troponin concentrations. Major bleeding complications were increased by glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (2.4% [445/18297] vs 1.4% [180/13105]; p<0.0001), but intracranial bleeding was not (16 [0.09%] vs 8 [0.06%]; p=0.40).Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors reduce the occurrence of death or myocardial infarction in patients with acute coronary syndromes not routinely scheduled for early revascularisation. The event reduction is greatest in patients at high risk of thrombotic complications. Treatment with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor might therefore be considered especially in such patients early after admission, and continued until a decision about early coronary revascularisation has been made."

Whereas the job strain model concentrates on situational (extrinsic) characteristics the effort-reward imbalance model analyses distinct person (intrinsic) characteristics in addition to situational ones. In view of these conceptual differences the hypothesis was tested that combining information from the two models improves the risk estimation of acute myocardial infarction.951 male and female myocardial infarction cases and 1147 referents aged 45-64 years of The Stockholm Heart Epidemiology (SHEEP) case-control study underwent a clinical examination. Information on job stress and health adverse behaviours was derived from standardised questionnaires.Multivariate analysis showed moderately increased odds ratios for either model. Yet, with respect to the effort-reward imbalance model gender specific effects were found: in men the extrinsic component contributed to risk estimation, whereas this was the case with the intrinsic component in women. Controlling each job stress model for the other in order to test the independent effect of either approach did not show systematically increased odds ratios. An improved estimation of acute myocardial infarction risk resulted from combining information from the two models by defining groups characterised by simultaneous exposure to effort-reward imbalance and job strain (men: odds ratio 2.02 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.34 to 3.07); women odds ratio 2.19 (95% CI 1.11 to 4.28)).Findings show an improved risk estimation of acute myocardial infarction by combining information from the two job stress models under study.

Smoking was more common among men (81%) than in women (35%). Abnormal high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were detected in 38% of the patients with a dear gender difference: 43% and 9%, in men and women, respectively. In contrast hypertension was more prevalent in young women with MI than in men: 38% and 19%, respectively. Coronary angiography was performed in 79 patients on admission; a single vessel stenosis was found in 28%, two vessel disease in 20% and triple vessel disease in 52%, respectively. On admission, 92% of patients were in Killip class I. Overt heart failure and cardiogenic shock were uncommon and were seen in 3.3% and 0.8%, respectively. Patients who received thrombolytic therapy had fewer complications (8%) compared to those who did not (11%). However, the difference towards a benefit of thrombolysis did not reach significance. Recurrent angina (6%) was the commonest complication, while ventricular arrhythmias were observed in 2% of patients. There was a strong familial link: 54% of the patients had a family background of coronary heart disease (CHD) while 42% and 41% had family members who suffered from diabetes mellitus and hypertension, respectively.Smoking and dyslipidaemia (predominantly hypertriglyceridaemia, and low HDL-cholesterol) were the most common cardiovascular risk factors of MI in young South African Indians. A strong familial link was observed not only for a history of CHD/MI, but also for hypertension and diabetes mellitus, supporting a genetic basis for the development of premature CHD. Therefore, further analysis of potential genetic factors such as variance of genes involved in vascular homeostasis, haemostatic factors, lipid metabolism and other metabolic factors seems warranted."

Although CHD mortality rates have been halved in many developed countries in recent decades, some studies have pointed out significant differences regarding time-related tendencies of mortality between the sexes. This paper briefly reviews factors related to post-AMI survival and possible reasons for inequalities in survival benefit between men and women after AMI. Presentation of AMI also exhibits differences with regard to sex, and this has some effect on patient care and on mortality from the disease. CHD morbidity and mortality rates vary with socioeconomic deprivation and social patterning in most industrialized countries. Several studies have indicated that women sustaining AMI have a higher mortality than men. Although AMI affects men in greater numbers, the short-term outcomes for women are worse. Studies suggest that, over the longer term, the mortality risk for women is lower than, or similar to, that for men. It is still a major problem that in-hospital case fatality and morbidity rates in the post-infarction period are higher for women, despite lower rates of administration of thrombolytics and catheterization. Patients admitted to the hospital with an AMI should be offered optimal treatment, irrespective of age or sex."

Moreover, it is unclear whether the demographic and clinical profile of patients receiving these agents is similar or varies according to the type of agent prescribed.The purpose of this study was to examine recent patterns and changes over a decade-long period (1986 to 1997) in the use of cardiac medications during the acute hospitalization and at the time of hospital discharge in metropolitan Worcester, Mass, residents (1990 census estimate, 437,000) hospitalized with confirmed AMI. There was a marked increase in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering agents, and thrombolytic therapy between 1986 and 1997. The use of calcium antagonists, lidocaine, and other antiarrhythmic agents declined over this period. Similar trends were observed in the use of these agents in hospital survivors at the time of hospital discharge. Patient age, presence of comorbidities, and AMI-associated characteristics influenced the use of these therapies; sex differences in the use of several of these medications were also noted.The results of this population-based observational study provide insights into changing prescribing patterns in the hospital treatment of patients with AMI. Despite encouraging increases in the use of several of these agents, considerable opportunities for increased utilization remain."

Standardized psychometric measures were administered to assess three psychosocial domains: (1) depression and general distress (mental health functioning), (2) social support, and (3) health-related quality of life. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to examine the effects of age, gender, and ethnic differences in each of the three psychosocial domains.Female patients reported higher levels of depression and distress compared with male patients (P = .040). Gender differences in mental health functioning differed by age (P = .046), with the greatest differences observed among younger female patients. Older patients (P = .014) and female patients (P = .025) reported lower levels of social support compared with younger and male patients, respectively. Minority patients did not differ from nonminority patients in mental health functioning or social support, and there were no significant differences in post-AMI quality of life on the basis of age, gender, or ethnicity.The psychosocial risk profile after AMI may be different for male and female patients, and interventions may need to take account of each gender's specific needs."

(SHOCK) Registry database of 1,190 patients with suspected CS in the setting of AMI, we examined shock etiologies by gender. Among the 884 patients with predominant left ventricular (LV) failure, we compared the patient demographics, angiographic and hemodynamic findings, treatment approaches as well as the clinical outcomes of women versus men. This study had a 97% power to detect a 10% absolute difference in mortality by gender.Left ventricular failure was the most frequent cause of CS for both gender groups. Women in the SHOCK Registry had a significantly higher incidence of mechanical complications including ventricular septal rupture and acute severe mitral regurgitation. Among patients with predominant LV failure, women were, on average, 4.6 years older, had a higher incidence of hypertension, diabetes and a lower cardiac index. The overall mortality rate for the entire cohort was high (61%). After adjustment for differences in patient demographics and treatment approaches, there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the two gender groups (odds ratio = 1.03, 95% confidence interval of 0.73 to 1.43, p = 0.88). Mortality was also similar for women and men who were selected for revascularization (44% vs. 38%, p = 0.244).Women with CS complicating AMI had more frequent adverse clinical characteristics and mechanical complications. Women derived the same benefit as men from revascularization, and gender was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality in the SHOCK Registry."

This is a retrospective study of all consecutive Kuwaiti patients admitted to the coronary care unit of a university hospital with the diagnosis of AMI between June 1994 and May 1997. A total of 89 women and 267 men were included. Women were older than men and had significantly higher rates of diabetes (72% vs 46%), hypertension (58% vs 33%) and hypercholesterolemia (80% vs 53%). Women were less likely to receive thrombolytic therapy (40% vs 62%, p=0.001). Fewer women were eligible for thrombolytic therapy (50% vs 66%, p<0.05). Of those who were eligible for thrombolysis there was no sex difference in receiving such treatment. The in-hospital mortality among women younger than 70 years was 2.5 times higher than among men in the same age group, while there was no difference in mortality between women and men aged 70 years and older. We conclude that women and men with AMI have different clinical characteristics and outcomes following AMI. There was no gender bias for the use of thrombolytic therapy. The higher in-hospital mortality in younger women, i.e. less than 70 years, compared to younger men, indicates that younger women with AMI should be considered as a high-risk group."

Short-term GHQ success was determined by a return to a normal GHQ score (<5) or a reduction of > or =50% after the two visits. Patients with short-term successful and unsuccessful GHQ outcomes were compared for mid-term maintenance of success, 1-year death and readmission rates, and 1-year depression and anxiety symptoms.Patients with short-term GHQ success were more likely to show mid-term GHQ success (p < .001), marginally less likely to die of any causes (p = .087), less likely to die of cardiac causes (p = .043), less likely to be readmitted for any reason (p < .001) and for cardiac reasons (p < .001), and less likely to have high depression (p < .001) and anxiety (p < .001) at 1-year than patients with short-term unsuccessful GHQ outcomes. Results held for men and women and were not altered by controlling for potential confounders.

The outcomes of 351 men in the study were compared to the group of 160 women. A rapid recovery protocol focused on reduced cardiopulmonary bypass time, aggressive preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump use, early extubation, perioperative administration of corticosteroids and thyroid hormone, aggressive diuresis and atrial fibrillation prevention was applied to all patients.The 30-day mortality rate for the women was 4.2% (Parsonnet risk 16.3+/-9.0) compared with 3.4% (Parsonnet risk 9.9+/-7.5) for the men. There were no statistically significant differences in the 30-day mortality rates or postoperative complication rates between the women and men.

When patients were examined by age group, however, only women younger than 60 years of age had a higher mortality rate than men of similar age. The sex difference decreased with increasing age; among the oldest patients, women had a lower mortality rate than men (P = 0.009 for the interaction between sex and age). This relationship was not affected by adjustment for demographic characteristics and medical history, clinical characteristics, and hospital and discharge treatments; the hazard of 2-year death for women compared with men increased 15.4% (95% CI, 4.3% to 27.6%) for every 10-year decrease in age. In absolute terms, after adjustment for demographic characteristics and medical history, among patients younger than 60 years of age women were at greater risk than men (risk difference, 1.8 percentage points). At older ages, however, women were at lower risk than men.Younger, but not older, women who survive hospitalization for myocardial infarction have a higher long-term mortality rate than men. This provides additional evidence that younger women with myocardial infarction are at greater risk for death than men."

Overall, one in four of all myocardial infarction victims died outside hospital. At all ages, except in individuals younger than 50 years, men had higher pre-hospital mortality. The odds of dying within 28 days for women below 50 years of age, compared to men, was 1.84 (1.56--2.18) in hospitalized patients and 1.31 (1.18--1.46) in all infarction patients. Above the age of 65, in the total population with myocardial infarction, women had a better prognosis, with odds ratios ranging from 0.83 to 0.89. In patients surviving the first 28 days, 4.0% of the women and 2.9% of the men below the age of 50 were dead within a year after the infarction, odds ratio 1.37 (1.06--1.76). This excess mortality was mainly due to diabetes and non-cardiac causes. Only women younger than 50 years had a significantly poorer overall 1-year survival than men of the same age. At the age of 70 or more, women had a small survival advantage.In the total acute myocardial infarction population, only women under 50 years of age have a consistently worse prognosis than men.

Data from registry databases indicate that women are less likely to receive medically proven therapies for myocardial infarction. Women experience more vague symptoms, which may account for underuse of effective therapies. In addition, they may benefit less from thrombolytic therapy than men. Increased use of thrombolytic therapy has resulted in a continued decrease in cardiovascular deaths for men, but not for women.

More than 450,000 women succumb to heart disease annually, and 250,000 die of coronary artery disease. Despite the proportions, most women believe they will die of breast cancer. The perception that heart disease is a man's disease and that women are more likely to die of breast cancer is alarming. Although women develop heart disease about 10 years later than men, they are likely to fare worse after a heart attack. The poorer outcomes are due, in part, to the failure to identify heart attack symptoms. Approximately 35% of heart attacks in women are believed to go unnoticed or unreported. However, because of increased age, women are more likely to have co-morbid diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. In women, not only is ""tightness"" or discomfort in the chest a warning sign, but in addition, nausea and dizziness are common indicators of myocardial ischemia. Other symptoms include breathlessness, perspiration, a sensation of fluttering in the heart, and fullness in the chest. In comparison to men, women are less likely to undergo tertiary care interventions such as cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, thrombolytic therapy, and bypass surgery; to participate in cardiac rehabilitation; and to return to work full-time after myocardial infarction. In the past, most research about treatments for heart disease focused on men, and gender differences have been ignored. Recent studies are enrolling enough women to test if there are differences between men and women in outcomes. One of the major areas of research relates to estrogen and hormonal replacement therapy to reduce the relative risk of heart attack and stroke. The Women's Health Initiative is a major NIH-sponsored trial that addresses the issue of primary prevention of cardiac disease by hormonal replacement therapy. The results will be available in 2004. The Heart Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS), disappointingly, did not show a significant reduction of coronary events in women taking hormonal replacement therapy, nor did the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis (ERA) trial of 309 postmenopausal women who underwent coronary angiography. New insight into the role of vitamins, phytoestrogens and other natural sources, and selective estrogen receptor modulators may provide other options for management. Until then, modification of risk factors and healthy life style choices are recommended for reducing the risk of cardiac disease. In fact, the key to a healthy heart in the year 2000 appears closely tied to life style choices. Prevention of disease is the key, and current recommendations are simply to stop smoking, or do not start; treat and control blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg; manage elevated lipids by diet, exercise, and cholesterol-lowering medications (if necessary); treat diabetes; lose weight so that BMI is <25; walk for 20-30 minutes at least three times a week; and take an aspirin tablet daily."

The aim of this study was to assess sex differences in medical and invasive coronary procedures (angiography, PTCA, and CABG) in AMI patients admitted to cardiac care units (CCUs) in Israel in the mid 1990s and their association with early and 1-year prognosis.We studied 2867 consecutive AMI patients (2125 men, 74%) hospitalized in all 25 CCUs in Israel from 3 prospective nationwide surveys conducted in 1992, 1994, and 1996. Women were, on average, older than men (69 versus 61 years, P:<0.0001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, Killip class >/=II on admission, and in-hospital complications. Women received aspirin and beta-blockers less often than did men, but these differences were not significant after age adjustment. The unadjusted rates of thrombolysis, angiography, and PTCA/CABG use were lower in women than in men but not after covariate adjustment: 42% versus 48% (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11), 23% versus 31% (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.09), and 15% versus 19% (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.19), respectively. The 30-day mortality was higher in women than in men (17.6% versus 9.6%, respectively; OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.82), but the 30-day to 1-year mortality rate was not (9.1% versus 5.6%, respectively; hazard ratio 1.18, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.66).This prospective nationwide observational community-based study of consecutive AMI patients hospitalized in the CCUs in the mid 1990s indicates that women fare significantly worse than do men at 30 days but not thereafter at 1-year. The difference in 30-day outcome was not influenced by the use of different therapeutic modalities, including thrombolysis and invasive coronary procedures, but was rather due to the older age and greater comorbidity of women; these findings seem also to explain the less frequent use of invasive procedures in women."

The determinants of this ominous prognosis are not completely understood. Preliminary analysis of our data suggested that this poorer prognosis is also observed in the subgroup of patients with acute myocardial infarction submitted to direct coronary angioplasty (PTCA). This finding prompted us to investigate gender differences and their determinants in this particular context.To identify risk factors associated with the greater in-hospital mortality of women with acute infarction who underwent PTCA.One hundred and forty-five consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent direct PTCA in the same hospital were studied retrospectively. Data were collected from the database of the catheterisation laboratory and from clinical files. The following parameters were analysed: in-hospital mortality, age, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, history of coronary heart disease, time elapsed from beginning of symptoms to coronary intervention, peak values of CK and MB-CK, number of coronary arteries with significant disease at angiography, culprit lesion localisation, and prevalence of shock on admission. For statistical analysis, cross-tabulation (Pearson x2) and comparison of means (Student's t test) were employed when appropriate; an error of 5% was admitted for the rejection of the null hypothesis.Women (n = 39) represented 26.9% of sample. In hospital mortality was 28.2% (n = 11) for women and 11.3% (n = 12) for men (p = 0.014). The prevalence of coronary heart disease before the current acute event, the time elapsed from beginning of symptoms to coronary intervention, and maximum values of CK and MB-CK were similar in both genders. Differences between women and men were found as regards the following variables (women vs men): age (61.7 +/- 10 vs 56.1 +/- 12.6 years), prevalence of left main disease (15.3 vs 1.9%) and prevalence of shock (41 vs 17%) and diabetes (38.7 vs 13.6%). Considering women and men who died, only disease severity as evaluated by the number of vessels involved distinguished both genders (p = 0.05).In our experience, women admitted with acute myocardial infarction and treated by direct PTCA are, on average, older than men and have a greater prevalence of shock at admission, of left main disease and of diabetes, and more severe coronary artery disease. In the present series and as regard in-hospital mortality, disease severity as evaluated by the number of vessels involved is the only variable that discriminates women from men."

There is a disturbing sex difference in that, during the same period, survival in women with AMI has not improved at all. This sex difference was not explained by differences in conventional prognostic factors."

Both women and men reported significantly less sexual activity and less satisfaction with sexual activity after AMI than before AMI. The decrease in frequency of and satisfaction with sexual activity after AMI was similar for women and men. The relations between selected demographic and medical variables such as age, education, and perceived health before the first AMI and the frequency of and satisfaction with sexual activity of the women and men did not appear to be affected differently by the AMI.

Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of mitochondrial K(ATP)channel is a major contributor of ischemic cardioprotection. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of K(ATP)channel in estrogen-induced myocardial protection after ischemia/reperfusion in dogs. Anaesthetized dogs were subjected to 60 min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 2 h of reperfusion. In a first study to characterize effects of sex and the dose-response profile of estrogen on infarct size, the drug was intravenously administered at 10 or 20 microg/kg. In a second study to investigate the cardioprotective mechanisms of estrogen, vehicle, preconditioning or 17 beta -estradiol (10 microg/kg) was given, beginning 15 min prior to the 60 min occlusion period in the presence or absence of 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD). In the first study, administration of 17 beta -estradiol resulted in a significant, dose-dependent limitation of infarct size. Estrogen administration provided myocardial protection of similar magnitude in both males and females. In the second study, infarct size in control animals averaged 39+/-5% of the risk region, compared with 14+/-5% of the risk region in estrogen-treated dogs and 6+/-5% of the risk region in preconditioning dogs (both P<0.0001 v controls). Pretreatment with 5-HD completely abolished preconditioning- and estrogen-induced cardioprotection. Estrogen limits myocardial infarction size resulting from coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion in a dose-dependent fashion, irrespective of gender difference. The infarct size-limiting effect of estrogen++ was abolished by 5-HD, suggesting that the cardioprotective effect of estrogen may result from activation of myocardial mitochondrial K(ATP)channels."

However, in controlled, hospital-based clinical trials, women die at higher rates than men. We hypothesized that evidence of a gender difference in the time of death following AMI may be found in controlled studies of hospitalized AMI patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO-1) and International Joint Efficacy Comparison of Thrombolytics (INJECT) trial databases using logistic regression modeling and time-to-death analyses. The age-adjusted female-to-male odds ratio for mortality was 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 1.5) in GUSTO-1 and 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 1.8) in INJECT. GUSTO-1 showed that among patients dying during the first 24 hours after symptom onset, men died an average of 1.7 hours earlier than women (p<0.001). This difference was due to earlier deaths among men < or =65 years of age. Furthermore, in GUSTO-1, the analysis of time to death in hour increments demonstrated that greater proportions of men died at earlier time points than women and a disproportionate number of early deaths occurred among younger men than among women of any age or older men. In INJECT, where time to death could only be analyzed in 1-day increments, no gender differences were evident. These results raise the possibility that the pattern of earlier death for men in thrombolytic clinical trials represents the continuation of a gender-specific mortality pattern that began before hospitalization. The death of a disproportionate number of men before hospitalization may represent an inherent gender bias for clinical studies enrolling only hospitalized patients. More high-risk men would be excluded from these studies than women because of death before hospitalization. Hence, gender comparisons of in-hospital mortality rates may artificially inflate values for women."

However, length of follow up and adjustment for confounding factors have varied and more importantly, the association between treatment and outcomes has not been examined.To investigate the association between sex differences in risk factors and hospital treatment and mortality after AMI.A prospective observational study collecting demographic and clinical data on cases of AMI admitted to hospitals in Yorkshire. The main outcome measures were mortality status at discharge from hospital and two years later.All district and university hospitals accepting emergency admissions in the former Yorkshire National Health Service (NHS) region of northern England.3684 consecutive patients with a possible diagnosis of AMI admitted to hospitals in Yorkshire between 1 September and 30 November 1995.AMI was confirmed by the attending consultant for 2196 admissions (2153 people, 850 women and 1303 men).

Adjustment for age removed much of the disparity in treatment. Crude mortality rate at two years was higher for women (OR 1.81, 95%CI 1.41, 2.31, p=0.00). Age, existing risk factors and acute treatment accounted for most of this difference, with treatment on discharge having little additional influence.Patients admitted to hospital with AMI should be offered optimal treatment irrespective of age or sex. Women have a worse prognosis after AMI and under-treatment of older people with aspirin and thrombolysis may be contributing to this."

The theoretical framework for this investigation was Hammond's lens model for clinical inference and Evan's two-stage reasoning model.Four focus group sessions were conducted. The participant's oral descriptions were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the Krueger method.Content analysis revealed several important issues influencing triage decisions: patient presentation, nursing knowledge and experience, practice environment, intuition, the fear of liability, and gender-specific behaviors. ED nurses held different perceptions regarding the significance and likelihood of MI for male and female patients seeking evaluation and treatment. In addition, ED nurses admitted that MI is not the first diagnosis considered for middle-aged women.The inability of ED nurses to associate middle-aged women's presenting symptoms with MI may contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality experienced by this population.

Overall, age-adjusted 28-day case fatality (MI plus CHD) was higher in black men compared with white men (odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.2) and in black women compared with white women (odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1. 2-2.0). Although men had higher overall case fatality rates than did women, this difference was not statistically significant. After a hospitalized MI, 28-day case fatality rate was not statistically significantly different between men compared with women or blacks compared with whites.Race and sex differences in case fatality after hospitalized MI were not evident in these data, although when out-of-hospital deaths were included, men and blacks were more likely than women and whites to die within 28 days of an acute cardiac event. A majority of deaths occurred before hospital admission, and additional study of possible reasons for these differences should be a priority."

A high Lp(a) level has also been shown to be an independent genetic risk factor, while its inverse relationship with TGF-beta 1 has suggested that it may interfere with plasmin-mediated activation of TGF-beta 1 and result in increased endothelial activation, as well as migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate Lp(a) and TGF-beta 1 and their interactions in patients with first acute myocardial infarction (AMI).A total of 107 patients with first AMI and 103 age and sex-matched controls were studied. Very good agreement was found between QEI and RIA determinations of Lp(a) (p < 0.0001). Lp(a) levels were significantly elevated in cases (QEI: p < 0.031; RIA p < 0.002 respectively). Division by gender gave statistically significant differences in females only. Plasma levels of the active form of TGF-beta 1 were decreased in cases, though significantly (p < 0.029) in males only.Serum concentrations of Lp(a) and TGF-beta 1 are significantly altered in AMI patients. The differences are gender-dependent: Lp(a) is higher in females, and TGF-beta 1 is lower in males. Increased Lp(a) levels are accompanied by decreased active TGF-beta 1 levels and this inverse correlation is statistically significant (p < 0.001)."

A clear assessment of AMI risk among female smokers is now of major public health importance, given the large number of women who smoke.The study is based on two case-control studies, conducted in Italy between 1983 and 1992, including 429 women and 801 men with AMI, and 863 female and 976 male controls, in hospital for acute conditions, unrelated to tobacco consumption, other than cardio or cerebrovascular and neoplastic. Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by unconditional multiple logistic regression, including terms for study center, age, education, and other major risk factors of cardiovascular disease.Compared with non-smokers, the OR was 4.1 (95% CI 2.3-5.7) for female and 3.3 (95% CI 2.4-4.6) for male current smokers. The OR for smokers of <15 cigarettes per day was 2.4 for women and 2.1 for men; the sex difference was more evident for smokers of 15 to 24 cigarettes per day (OR 5.6 for women and 3.2 for men) and of >/= 25 cigarettes per day (OR 9.8 for women and 5.4 for men). The ORs in increasing duration categories were 3.6, 4.2, and 25.0 for women and 3.1, 3.9, and 3.2 for men. There was an inverse relation between the smoking-related risk of AMI and age among men, but no clear pattern with age was observed among women.Our study confirms that the relative risk of AMI is higher among female than among male smokers, and the difference is greater for heavy and long-term smokers."

There were 165 grafts constructed in 148 patients (101 in 87 men, and 64 in 61 women). Gender differences were analyzed with Student t test or chi2 test for risk factors, indications for reconstruction, and complications. The patency rates and the long-term survival rates were compared by means of life-table analysis. Eagle criteria and long-term survival rates were compared with multivariate analysis.The mean follow-up period was 36 months (39 months for men, and 32 months for women), with a range of 6 to 123 months for the total follow-up period. The two groups did not differ in age at the time of operation (66.6 +/- 1.2 years for men, and 66.7 +/- 1.5 years for women) or in history of diabetes (48% for men, and 56% for women). The risks were similar for hypertension (48% for men vs 45% women), preoperative myocardial infarction (23% for men vs 26% for women), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (9% for men vs 8% for women). The thallium stress scintigraphy results showed a diagnosis of proportionately more preoperative defects in men (reversible, 34% vs 18%, P <.05; overall, 75% vs 43%, P <.05). The 30-day limb loss rates (0.9% for men, and 0% for women) and mortality rates (2.2% for men, and 5% for women) were similar. Women had statistically more perioperative myocardial infarctions than did men (6 of 61, 9.8% vs 2 of 101, 2%; P <.05), as was documented with electrocardiography and cardiac isoenzymes. Two of these women died within a 30-day postoperative period. The 3-year primary patency rate was 85% for the men and 88% for the women, and the primary assisted patency rate was 97% for the men and 97% for the women. The secondary patency rate was 98% for the men and 97% for the women. The limb salvage rate was slightly higher for the men than for the women (93% vs 87%), although this was not statistically significant. The 5-year survival rate for women was statistically less than for men, with life-table analysis (58% for men vs 42% for women; P <.05).After distal bypass grafting, men and women have similar rates of patency and limb salvage, but women have a higher incidence rate of perioperative myocardial infarction and a decreased 5-year survival rate. These data suggest that women have unrecognized cardiac disease that affects them adversely in the perioperative period and the long term when compared with men who undergo the same operation."

Baseline (1984) in-person interview data were linked to Medicare hospitalization records for 1984-1991. Subjects were 6,071 noninstitutionalized adults 70 years old or older at baseline. Hospitalization for AMI was defined as having primary discharge diagnoses containing ICD9-CM 410 codes. Multivariable proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the epidemiologic risks for all persons, and separately for women, men, self-respondents, those with no previous AMIs, and those with no history of coronary heart disease.Of the sample, 357 persons (5.9%; 172 women and 185 men) had at least one primary discharge diagnosis of AMI. Significant (p<.05) risk factors for being hospitalized with an AMI (adjusted hazards ratios in parentheses) from the pooled analysis were male gender (1.86), having no more than a grade school education (1.35), atherosclerosis (1.43), hypertension (1.29), coronary heart disease (1.63), angina (1.60), previous AMI (1.52), diabetes (1.89), and four or more lower body limitations (1.43). The gender-specific analyses, however, revealed that hypertension, angina, diabetes, and lower body limitations were risk factors only for women, and that having no more than a grade school education was a risk factor only for men.Men, especially those with low education, women with diabetes, angina, hypertension, or lower body limitations, and either men or women with previous AMIs, coronary heart disease, or atherosclerosis have elevated risks for AMI resulting in hospitalization, and they should be considered for evaluation and monitoring. Current protocols for therapeutic management should be adopted, and compliance should be encouraged."

We hypothesized that younger, but not older, women have higher mortality rates during hospitalization than their male peers.We analyzed data on 384,878 patients (155,565 women and 229,313 men) who were 30 to 89 years of age and who had been enrolled in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 2 between June 1994 and January 1998. Patients who had been transferred from or to other hospitals were excluded.The overall mortality rate during hospitalization was 16.7 percent among the women and 11.5 percent among the men. Sex-based differences in the rates varied according to age. Among patients less than 50 years of age, the mortality rate for the women was more than twice that for the men. The difference in the rates decreased with increasing age and was no longer significant after the age of 74 (P< 0.001 for the interaction between sex and age). Logistic-regression analysis showed that the odds of death were 11.1 percent greater for women than for men with every five-year decrease in age (95 percent confidence interval, 10.1 to 12.1 percent). Differences in medical history, the clinical severity of the infarction, and early management accounted for only about one third of the difference in the risk. After adjustment for these factors, women still had a higher risk of death for every five years of decreasing age (increase in the odds of death, 7.0 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 5.9 to 8.1 percent).After myocardial infarction, younger women, but not older women, have higher rates of death during hospitalization than men of the same age. The younger the age of the patients, the higher the risk of death among women relative to men. Younger women with myocardial infarction represent a high-risk group deserving of special study."

Information was obtained on age, gender, time of onset of symptoms, delay to hospital arrival, mode of transport, and coronary risk factor analysis. The patients were followed up in hospital for analysis of modes of therapy, complications and mortality.Of 433 admissions, 99 were female. Compared to men, women were older, presented later, smoked less but tended to have a higher frequency of hypertension. The other coronary risk factors were similarly prevalent in males and females. Inotropic agents were used more commonly in females but thrombolytics were used less so. Women tended to develop more heart failure and had significantly higher incidence of recurrent ischemia or myocardial infarction, high level atrioventricular block and atrial arrhythmias. The overall mortality rate was higher in females than in males (16.2% vs. 8.1%, P = 0.037).The results reveal similarities between gender differences among Lebanese and Western populations. The higher mortality rate in women may relate to the late arrival to hospital, the older age and the more frequent complications. This emphasizes the need to educate women about coronary risk and to urge them to seek early medical care."

Data were collected before, during, and after CA, and again 6 months later.The sample consisted of 54 women and 166 men undergoing scheduled CA.To compare fear levels at different points of evaluation; two analyses of covariance for repeated measures were performed.On average, women had significantly higher mean scores of fear across the points of evaluation on the Visual Analogue Scale than men (P <.001). During the hospital stay, the most intense fear for both women and men was the fear of coronary artery bypass grafting and the uncertainty about the illness, whereas at home it was the fear of myocardial infarction. On average, women reported significantly intense fears more frequently than men across time. On average, men experienced more intensive fear of problems in their sex life than women (P =. 032). The changes in intensity of fears over time were not significantly different by gender, except in fear of pain (P =.013), health care staff not having enough time to care for the patient (P =.039), and health care staff discussing the patient's condition without the patient being present (P =.048). Age and prior CA were found to be significantly related to most of the fears at different points of evaluation, and to the changes of fears over time.There existed differences in the tendency to report intensity of fears by gender; however, the intensity of fears changed in a similar way over time. The results suggest that the few gender differences in fears that existed may be explained by the treatment chosen for the patients and the patients' acceptance of it. Therefore, it is important to adapt information and support according to the treatment chosen for the patient."

The sample included 896 patients (283 women) who survived to discharge and received usual posthospital care. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk of 1-year cardiac mortality associated with baseline BDI scores.There were 290 patients (133 women) with BDI scores > or =10 (at least mild to moderate symptoms of depression); 8.3% of the depressed women died of cardiac causes in contrast to 2.7% of the nondepressed. For depressed men, the rate of cardiac death was 7.0% in contrast to 2.4% of the nondepressed. Increased BDI scores were significantly related to cardiac mortality for both genders [the odds ratio for women was 3.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-10.59); for men, the odds ratio was 3.05 (95% CI = 1.29-7.17)]. Control for other multivariate predictors of mortality in the data set (age, Killip class, the interactions of gender by non-Q wave MI, gender by left ventricular ejection fraction, and gender by smoking) did not change the impact of the BDI for either gender.Depression in hospital after MI is a significant predictor of 1-year cardiac mortality for women as well as for men, and its impact is largely independent of other post-MI risks."

Two comparison groups were used.Three hundred fifty-seven AMI cases (6%; 172 women and 185 men) were compared with 3976 hospitalized controls and 1738 nonhospitalized controls. The risk of all-cause mortality for AMI cases was greater than that for either hospitalized controls or nonhospitalized controls (referent), and this increased risk was significantly (P < .001) stronger for women (adjusted hazards ratio (AHR) = 14.24, 95%CI = 10.99, 18.46) than for men (AHR = 9.91, 95%CI = 7.75, 12.67). Overall, AMI cases were also more likely to be hospitalized subsequently than the hospitalized controls (referent; adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.17, 1.85), although in the stratified analysis this association held for men (AOR = 1.73, 95%CI = 1.25, 2.41) but not for women (AOR = 1.25, 95%CI = .90, 1.73). Among those subsequently hospitalized, both women and men AMI cases consumed more hospital resources than the hospitalized controls, and there were gender differences suggesting that the effects on total charges and length of stay were greater for women than for men with AMI. Finally, although the AMI cases had greater adjusted mean increases in the number of instrumental activities of daily living limitations and lower body limitations than the nonhospitalized controls, they were no worse off than the hospitalized controls, and there were no gender differences in those effects.Relative to the appropriate comparison groups, hospitalization for an AMI increases the risk of death and the total costs and lengths of stay of subsequent hospitalizations for women more than for men. Therefore, increased primary prevention, diagnosis, and treatment efforts should be directed toward women."

The mechanisms behind these observations are less well described. This survey describes gender differences in the aetiology of chest pain and symptoms associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Among the patients with symptoms of acute chest pain, in the emergency medical department women less frequently develop an AMI and are less frequently given a diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease. Among patients developing an AMI, women differ from men by less frequently reporting chest pain, more frequently reporting nausea, vomiting, abdominal complaints, fatigue and dyspnoea and less frequently reporting sweating. With regard to the localization of pain in AMI, women differ from men by more frequently reporting pain in the back, neck and jaw. In terms of electrocardiographic changes, women seem to have less marked ST deviations than men. However, we do not believe that these differences between women and men are substantial enough and, as a result, we do not recommend that the initial medical care of patients seeking medical attention with chest pain or other symptoms raising a suspicion of AMI should be differentiated with regard to gender. The differences described here might partly explain the prolonged delay until hospital admission in women suffering from AMI."

In 83 women and 187 men with analyzable data (n = 270), 42 factors related to baseline characteristics, presentation, treatment, and outcomes were identified and analyzed for gender differences.On average, women were 5 years older than men (p < .01). By univariate comparison, women were less likely than men to be smokers (p < .001); more likely to have underlying hypertension (p < .01), diabetes mellitus (p < 0.05), non-Q-wave infarctions (p < .01), and congestive heart failure (CHF, p < .05); and more likely to have received diuretics (p < .001) and ACE inhibitors (p < .01). While women were less likely than men to undergo coronary angiography (p < .05) and more likely to have echocardiograms (p < 0.05), rates of coronary artery bypass graft surgery, angioplasty, and the use of thrombolytics were similar for men and women. Clinical outcomes were similar in both groups. CHF, hypertension, and use of ACE inhibitors remained the only significant gender differences when data were adjusted for age.Comparing men and women with acute MI at UW Hospital revealed some differences in clinical characteristics and management. Except for CHF, hypertension, and use of ACE inhibitors (all of which may be related), these differences disappeared when the data were adjusted for age. This is particularly notable for the disappearance of the difference in the use of coronary angiography between men and women. The comparable use of beta-blockers, aspirin, and nitrates, and the similar clinical outcomes in men and women, suggest less gender difference in MI management at UW Hospital than reported in other studies."

There are several speculations regarding the nature of this phenomenon which have both supporting and refuting evidence. Our hypothesis was that due to regular physiologic bleeding, rheological properties of blood of pre-menopausal women are superior to those of men, and place such women at a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases than men in any age group. We believe that this difference in hemorheological properties is due to the reduced concentration of red blood cells (RBCs) and due to greater population of younger and less population of older RBCs in female blood. We studied mechanical properties of blood from 47 pre-menopausal women and 50 age-matched men. Compared to female blood, male blood had higher viscosity and RBC aggregation and lower RBC deformability. Oxygen Delivery Index, calculated as a ratio of hematocrit to blood viscosity, was found to be significantly lower in male blood. Decreased oxygen delivery along with increased RBC aggregation and decreased RBC deformability may contribute to the higher risk for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Regular blood donation may reduce hematocrit and blood viscosity, improve rheological properties of blood, and increase oxygen delivery in men."

Infarctions caused a similar degree of global and regional LV systolic dysfunction in males and females. Male rats had significant increases in the thickness of the noninfarcted posterior wall by 6 weeks after MI. However, posterior wall thickness did not change in the infarcted female rats. Average myocyte diameter in the noninfarcted region of the heart was also greater in male than female MI rats. The combination of increased cavity size with little change in wall thickness resulted in a greater decline in relative wall thickness in the female rats compared to the males. Male rats with MI showed progressively restricted LV diastolic filling as assessed by transmitral Doppler recordings. Female rats had less of an increase in the ratio of early to late transmitral velocities and less of an increase in the E wave deceleration rate after MI.Female rats showed a different pattern of LV remodeling than males with less of an increase in thickness of the noninfarcted portions of the left ventricle than males, but comparable LV cavity enlargement and systolic dysfunction. Despite similar infarct size, females developed less pronounced abnormalities of LV diastolic filling. We hypothesize that the gender-related differences in postinfarction LV remodeling may contribute to the different LV filling patterns, and might ultimately relate to differences in clinical outcome."

During one period, 1988 to 1989, women received significantly less thrombolytic therapy which, however, could reflect that women admitted with AMI were older than men. Analysis of time-trends showed a significant increase in the use of thrombolytic treatment in women and elderly men. In clinical praxis there has been a gender-gap in acute treatment of AMI, but age-dependent or not, this is now no longer apparent."

Data for the study were abstracted from medical records.Women had a 40% higher hospital mortality rate than men. Simple age adjustment eliminated the sex difference in mortality rate (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.48). However, when the sample was subdivided into 2 age groups, women younger than 75 years showed twice as high a mortality rate as men in the same age group, while among older patients no difference in mortality was found. In multivariate analyses the interaction of sex with age was highly significant, even after adjusting for comorbid conditions, clinical severity, process of care, and hospital characteristics. In the fully adjusted model, this interaction indicated that among patients younger than 75 years women had 49% higher odds of hospital death than men, while in the age group 75 years or older women had 46% lower odds of death compared with men.A higher mortality of women compared with men after MI is confined to the younger age groups.

Moreover, women were significantly more anxious and scored significantly higher on social inhibition and vital exhaustion than men.At entry into rehabilitation, women in this sample report a higher degree of psychosocial impairment and a lower level of physical functioning than men. Women's significantly higher scores on social inhibition and vital exhaustion might partly explain their reported higher drop-out and lower adherence rates in cardiac rehabilitation."

The purpose of this study was to document patterns of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation use and identify factors predicting its use.The Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry of the Minnesota Heart Survey enrolled 3,841 patients admitted on suspicion of acute myocardial infarction (MI) to the coronary care units at six Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan hospitals. Participants were contacted 1 year after index hospitalization and asked if they participated in cardiac rehabilitation since discharge.Among those discharged with a MI, 47% participated in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation or an exercise program at an exercise facility, home, or both during the 1-year follow-up period. Among those discharged with angina, 21% attended cardiac rehabilitation. Usage increased when cardiac revascularization procedures were performed during the index hospitalization. Women with an angina or MI diagnosis were significantly less likely to use cardiac rehabilitation than men. Older patients were also less likely to use rehabilitation, with gender difference persisting across age strata. As education increased, cardiac rehabilitation utilization increased. Those not employed were less likely to use cardiac rehabilitation services. The strongest independent predictors of cardiac rehabilitation utilization were age and revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting or coronary angioplasty), simultaneously adjusting for demographic information, and cardiovascular disease risk factors.These data suggest that there is a disparity in cardiac rehabilitation utilization with lower rates among women, older individuals, those with less education, and the unemployed."

For these analyses, the following variables were examined in 354 435 patients with acute myocardial infarction: demographics; use of medical therapy including thrombolytic agents; use of procedures including cardiac catheterization, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass surgery; length of hospital stay; adverse events (stroke, major bleeding, or recurrent myocardial infarction); and causes of death.In comparison with men, women experiencing acute myocardial infarction in the United States are older, with 55.7% older than 70 years. Women have a higher mortality rate than men even when controlled for age and die less often from arrhythmia but more often from cardiac rupture whether or not thrombolytic therapy is used. Treatment with aspirin, heparin, or beta-blockers is less frequent in women. When thrombolytic therapy is used, women are treated an average of almost 14 minutes later than men and experience a greater incidence of major bleeding. Cardiac catheterization, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass surgery are used less often in women.Observations from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction-I document important sex differences in demographics, treatment, and outcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction in the United States."

Although the mortality rates from this disease are decreasing in the majority of developed nations, most developing countries are experiencing upward trends, especially among men. The mortality trends of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Taiwan have not been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of age, chronicle period, and birth cohort on the AMI mortality rates using computerized vital statistics data from 1974 through 1993. Compared with the age-adjusted AMI mortality rates in 1974, the mortality rates in 1993 were 2.4 times higher for men and 2.2 times higher for women. When the log-linear Poisson model was used to assess age, birth cohort, and chronicle period simultaneously, women had no elevated relative risk of dying from AMI in different periods. The relative risk of dying from AMI increased 2.5 times for men in the 1955-1959 birth cohort compared with those in the 1890-1894 birth cohort, while the relative risk for females declined by 3.7 times for the corresponding birth cohorts. Based on birth cohort, the trends in mortality differ substantially between sexes in Taiwan. These results may help to generate hypotheses regarding the possible factors, prevention, and control of mortality from AMI in Taiwan."

In accordance with the guidelines, use of coronary angiography was determined for the in-hospital and ""0 to 8 weeks"" postdischarge periods. Patients were assigned time specific ACC/AHA classes for coronary angiography indications (I = highly indicated, IIA = probably indicated, IIB = not harmful, III = not indicated). The independent impact of ACC/AHA class, age, race, and facility on the sex and use of coronary angiography relation was examined by the Cox proportional hazard model.Accounting only for ACC/AHA class, fewer women underwent coronary angiography compared with men among the ""highly indicated"" class I patients during the in-hospital period (43% vs 35%; p < 0.05), but not after discharge. Use of coronary angiography between the sexes was not statistically different among classes IIA, IIB, and III for both periods. After adjusting for differences in age, race, facility, and ACC/AHA class, we found no sex difference in in-hospital use of coronary angiography (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.26), but among those discharged without receiving coronary angiography, women probably received fewer angiograms than did men (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.00). For both periods, no significant sex difference in use of coronary angiography was found within ACC/AHA classes after adjustments.In a setting where health insurance is prepaid and after controlling for ACC/AHA classification for coronary angiography indications, age, race, and facility, use of coronary angiography after myocardial infarction was similar among men and women during hospitalization, but was lower among women after discharge. Likely explanations for these differences in use of coronary angiography may include effects of physician judgment, patient decision, other social factors, or clinical information not captured in the practice guidelines."

According to NHS results prevalence rates of hypertension, overweight, and smoking in men exceed those of women, whereas hypercholesterolaemia is equally prevalent in both sexes. From 1984/85 to 1990/91 the NHS revealed a marked decline of smoking in men, and a parallel increase in women. The prevalence of chest pain shows no gender difference, but chest pain in men is more predictive for coronary artery disease. In acute myocardial infarction [AMI] thrombolysis and PTCA are applied with equal frequency; the average length of stay in hospital is greater for women. Coronary bypass surgery and rehabilitation in hospitals are less frequently applied in women. Little is known about gender differences in psychosocial adaptation after AMI. AMI mortality rates in all age groups are lower in women, and their mean age of death is higher. However, the decline of AMI mortality since 1980 was less pronounced in women compared to men."

Between January 1991 and February 1993, 4,497 patients were admitted to the CCUs with diagnosed AMI. Accredited record technicians abstracted age, gender, race, transport method, symptom presentation (chest pain, sweating, nausea, shortness of breath, epigastric pain, and fainting), delay time interval between acute symptom onset and presentation to hospital ED, and discharge diagnosis from the patients' medical records. After adjusting for age and history of diabetes, no gender differences remained for frequencies of chest pain, fainting, or epigastric pain. Women reported more nausea and shortness of breath but less sweating than men as symptoms of AMI. Chest pain, sweating, and fainting were associated with decreasing delay time intervals. Age, gender, histories of AMI and diabetes, and transport choice were also significantly related to delay time interval. These results show that gender differences occur in AMI symptom experience. However, how symptoms relate to the gender gap in delay time interval is not clear. These findings suggest that health care professionals need to tailor information about possible symptoms of AMI to the patient's gender, age, and medical history."

The reasons for this gender-related difference are not well understood. Cardiovascular autonomic regulation modifies the outcome of acute coronary events, and there are gender differences in the autonomic regulation of heart rate (HR) in normal physiologic circumstances.We analyzed the changes in HR, HR variability and blood pressure and the occurrence of ventricular ectopic beats during a 2-min coronary occlusion in 140 men and 65 women referred for single-vessel coronary angioplasty. The ranges of nonspecific responses were determined by analyzing a control group of 19 patients with no ischemia during a 2-min balloon inflation in a totally occluded coronary artery.Women more often had ST segment changes (p < 0.01) and chest pain (p < 0.05) during the occlusion. Significant bradycardia or increase in HR variability as a sign of vagal activation occurred more often in women than in men (31% vs. 13%, p < 0.01 and 25% vs. 11%, p < 0.05, respectively). Coronary occlusion also more often caused (28% vs. 11%, p < 0.01) a decrease in blood pressure in women. The most pronounced female preponderance was in the incidence of Bezold-Jarisch-type reaction (i.e., simultaneous bradycardia and decrease in blood pressure [16% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.0001]). Logistic regression models developed to analyze the significance of gender while controlling for baseline variables and signs of ischemia identified female gender to be an independent predictor of bradycardic reactions (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 7.7, p < 0.01), hypotensive reactions (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.0, p < 0.05) and Bezold-Jarisch-type response (OR 22.2, 95% CI 2.5 to 200, p < 0.01). Significance of female gender as a protector against early coronary occlusion-induced ventricular ectopic beats emerged as having borderline significance (OR 0.4, CI 0.1 to 1.1, p = 0.07).Vagal activation is more common in women than in men during abrupt coronary occlusion and may have beneficial antiarrhythmic effects, modifying the outcome of acute coronary events."

The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trials collected detailed demographic, clinical, and psychosocial data on 2,043 men and 448 women following acute MIs. Analyses indicate that women had a worse clinical, socioeconomic, and psychosocial profile than did men. In addition, significant differences in psychosocial profiles persisted after controlling for demographic and clinical data, suggesting that women presenting with MIs have a cluster of complex factors that put them at high risk for morbidity and mortality following an MI. Future longitudinal studies that include adequate numbers of women as well as reliable assessments of both clinical and psychological variables are needed to better understand the factors that influence the poor prognosis for women with coronary heart disease."

Further adjustment for CA and RV lowered CVD mortality in women slightly (HR, 1.14). RV is associated with lowered CVD (HR, .41).In patients with high indication for CA, use of CA and RV was significantly lower in women. After adjustments were made for risk profile and treatment modalities, women did not have a significantly increased risk for CVD compared with men.

When the population was divided into expected risk quartiles, women were more likely to fall into the higher expected risk quartiles, even after adjusting for age. A gender gap after acute MI is apparent, nearly all of which occurs within the first 30 days. A substantial portion of the gender gap is explained by the increased age of women, and the rest of the gap may be attributed to differences in variables predictive of 30-day mortality.

The Secondary Prevention Reinfarction Israeli Nifedipine Trial (SPRINT) registry includes 5,839 consecutive myocardial infarction patients who were hospitalized in 13 coronary care units in Israel between 1981 and 1983. The authors examined sex differences in the long-term survival of 4,808 hospital survivors (1,120 women and 3,688 men). Women exhibited a significantly poorer long-term survival than men. After age adjustment, differences between men and women decreased, leaving a survival probability difference of 11% at the end of 12 years of follow-up. In a subgroup analysis, women exhibited poorer survival than men in a comparison of patients with and without periinfarction congestive heart failure or a history of myocardial infarction preceding the index infarction. The multivariate adjusted hazard ratios associated with female sex in diabetic and nondiabetic patients were 1.46 and 1.13, respectively. In conclusion, a cumulative survival disadvantage for women in comparison with men is still evident after 12 years of follow-up. The mortality difference is diminished but not erased after age adjustment or multivariate adjustment for confounders. The authors' results are compatible with a hypothesis that the main factor underlying the increased long-term mortality in women after myocardial infarction, besides older age, is diabetes mellitus."

However, the characteristics and outcome of women compared with men with unstable angina and non-Q wave MI have not been extensively studied.The characteristics, outcomes and proportion of 497 women and 976 men with unstable angina and non-Q wave MI at the time of enrollment were compared. When these proportions were noted to be significantly different, we compared them with the 7,731-patient TIMI IIIB Registry, which represents the non-trial, screened population with these syndromes at these centers.For both coronary syndromes, women were older, were less frequently white, had a higher incidence of diabetes and hypertension and were receiving more cardiac medications. The 42-day rate of death and MI in TIMI IIIB was similar for women and men (7.4% vs. 7.5%). Coronary angiography revealed less severe coronary artery disease for women than for men, with absence of critical obstructions in 25% versus 16% and mean ejection fractions 62 +/- 12% versus 57 +/- 13% for women versus men (p < 0.01). Medical management failed in women as often as in men, and rates of cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery were similar for women and men in the conservative strategy arm as well as in the invasive strategy arm. Women in the TIMI IIIB trial had proportionately more unstable angina than did men. The proportion of unstable angina and non-Q wave MI for women was similar in the trial and Registry. However, proportionately more men in the trial had non-Q wave MI than men in the Registry.1) Women with each acute coronary syndrome are older than men and have more comorbidity. 2) The outcome with unstable angina and non-Q wave MI is related to severity of illness and not gender. 3) Mortality associated with revascularization for unstable angina and non-Q wave MI was similar for women and men. 4) The proportion of women and men enrolled with each acute coronary syndrome is different. These rates reflect both the prevalence of disease and selection bias owing to trial eligibility criteria and other identified factors."

Men and women with abnormal images had similar event rates, 19.6% and 18.2%, respectively, although men more often had myocardial infarction or cardiac death (7.6% vs 4.1 %, p < 0.05), whereas women had an increased likelihood of unstable angina or congestive heart failure (11.5% vs 7.6%, p < 0.05). Normal images predicted a low yearly rate of myocardial infarction or death: 1.7% for men and 0.8% for women. Image findings, particularly defect extent, were independent predictors of events in both groups. Thus, after stress Tc-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion imaging, there was no gender bias in referral for invasive procedures, and for both men and women image findings were strongly associated with prognostic outcome."

Hypertension, total and HDL cholesterol levels, and obesity were based on standardized measurements, whereas smoking, diabetes, and history of myocardial infarction, stroke, and angina pectoris were based on self-report, using standardized questionnaires. Occupations were categorized into 13 (males) or 12 (females) groups as proposed by Blossfeld, as well as according to the 30 most frequent specific occupations. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to adjust for age, cardiovascular risk factors, and socio-economic status (SES).Among males, after adjusting for age, cardiovascular risk factors and SES, all 12 occupational groups had significantly elevated odds rations for the prevalence of cardiovascular disease when compared with the reference category of professionals. Among females, no significant increase in cardiovascular disease was found in any of the 11 main occupational groups. Teachers were used as the reference category for the 30 most frequent occupations. In males, five occupations (carpenter, locksmith, warehouse clerk, doorman, and driver) yielded significantly elevated age-adjusted odds ratios for the prevalence of self-reported cardiovascular disease. In females, we found significant associations with cardiovascular disease only for two occupations (kindergarten-teacher and cook).The findings suggest that certain aspects of the workplace and its culture, particularly in blue-collar occupations, influence the cardiovascular risk in men to a greater extent than in women."

These studies vary by data source (hospital discharge abstract versus detailed clinical information) and severity measurement methods. The authors examined whether evaluations of gender differences for acute myocardial infarction patients vary by data source and severity measure.The authors considered 10 severity measures: four using clinical medical record data and six using discharge abstracts (diagnosis and procedure codes). The authors studied all 14,083 patients admitted in 1991 for acute myocardial infarction to 100 hospitals nationwide, examining in-hospital death and use of coronary angiography, coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for death and procedure use for women compared with men, controlling for age and each of the severity scores.After adjusting only for age, women were significantly more likely than men to die and less likely to receive CABG and coronary angiography. Severity measures provided different assessments of whether women were sicker than men; for all cases, clinical data-based MedisGroups rated women's severity compared with men's, whereas four code-based severity measures viewed women as sicker. After adjusting for severity and age, women were significantly more likely than men to die in-hospital and less likely to receive coronary angiography and CABG; women and men had relatively equal adjusted odds ratios of receiving PTCA. Odds ratios reflecting gender differences in procedure use and death rates were similar across severity measures.Comparisons of severity-adjusted in-hospital death rates and invasive procedure use between men and women yielded similar findings regardless of data source and severity measure."

A consecutive group of 2,067 patients who underwent angioplasty at a single institution after 1990 is described. Angioplastic success was 92.2% and similar among men and women and the various age groups. Sixteen patients (0.8%) died, and mortality among women was significantly higher (1.4 vs. 0.6%, p < 0.001). There were no age or gender differences in the rate of Q-wave myocardial infarction and the need for coronary artery bypass. Minor complications such as groin complications (10.5% women, 5.0% men; p < 0.001) and infections (6.4% women, 3.7% men; p < 0.05) were more common in women, and as a result the duration of hospitalization after angioplasty was longer. The length of hospitalization after angioplasty was longer with advanced age, mainly as a result of higher groin complications (p < 0.001), infections (p < 0.01) and renal failure (p < 0.05). We conclude that using current indications and technique, angioplasty can be performed safely with a high success rate. Mortality is higher among women. The length of hospitalization after angioplasty is longer in women and, at advanced age, due to higher rate of minor complications."

Both patients and spouses were distressed by the MI, but the distress lasted longer for spouses. Male spouses increased traditional domestic activities (e.g. cooking, laundry) in the weeks shortly after their wives' heart attack, and patient wives decreased domestic activities compared to prior to the MI. However, wives still did as much as their husbands. Women recovering from MI may carry a heavier burden of household responsibilities and activities than their male counterparts. This burden, if premature, may pose a threat for reinfarction during the early stages of rehabilitation."

The mean age of women was 79.3 and of men, 77.3.Data on clinical characteristics were abstracted from medical records. Sociodemographic, psychosocial, and physical function information was derived from the EPESE interview preceding the infarction. The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality, for which three end points were used: early mortality (first 30 days), late mortality (1-year mortality among survivors of the first 30 days), and overall mortality (1-year mortality from admission in the whole sample).Mortality in the first 30 days did not differ significantly in the two sexes. The relative risk (RR) of death in women compared with men was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-1.47) before multivariable adjustment; this was unchanged after adjustment for demographic factors, comorbidity, functional status, psychosocial factors, and clinical severity (RR, 0.85, 95% CI, 0.41-1.76).

From the medical records, we obtained the observed rate of thrombolytic use, and we defined the shortfall as the proportion of patients with no contraindication but who did not receive a thrombolytic.Thrombolytic treatment had been used in 13-52% (median 36%) of the patients. Among untreated patients, we identified three groups of similar size: those whose symptom onset was more than 12 h (or unknown) before presentation; those causing diagnostic difficulty at presentation and/or lacking ECG criteria for treatment; and those with no apparent reason for withholding thrombolytic treatment (ie, the shortfall, which was 20%). Logistic regression analysis in all patients without contraindications showed that older patients and women were less likely to receive thrombolytic treatment. The adjusted odds ratio for female sex was 0.69 (95% CI 0.53-0.89), and that for age 65-74, for instance (versus 0-44), was 0.55 (0.34-0.89). These factors of age and sex were independent, and we noted that older patients and women were under-represented in the clinical trials of thrombolytic therapy for AMI.We confirmed that only about one-third of patients admitted to European hospitals with AMI receive a thrombolytic drug. Allowing for delays to presentation and difficulty of early diagnosis, the maximum rate of thrombolysis is about 55%. The lower use of thrombolysis in the elderly may be due to their under-representation in the clinical trials; the sex difference is unexplained."

Many results, such as the overall 28-day fatality rates of 49.8% in men and 48.5% in women, showed insignificant differences. However, 74.3% of deaths in men occurred out of hospital versus 67.8% in women (P = .0004). After admission to hospital, fatality rates in women were 14% higher (P = .07) and after admission to coronary care, 22% higher (P = .04). Women were more often widowed. Fewer had a history of previous myocardial infarction, but the prevalence of angina pectoris, of smoking, and of chest pain in the attack was the same as in men; more had shock, syncope, and breathlessness. More consulted a doctor before admission to hospital, which delayed their coming under care. More men had ECG Q-wave progression, and more women had smaller ECG changes. This, and marginally reduced chances of direct admission to coronary care, of thrombolysis, of aspirin, and of beta-blockers, did not explain women's excess hospital fatality.Acute coronary events appear to be recognized and treated fairly equally in men and women 25 to 64 years old in Glasgow, so differences are small but subtle.

These findings were unchanged after we controlled for risk factors and signs of disease at baseline. There were no sex differences in effect sizes.High levels of depressive symptomatology are associated with increased risks of MI and mortality. The graded relationships between depression scores and risk, long-lasting nature of the effect, and stability of the depression measured across time suggest that this risk factor is best viewed as a continuous variable that represents a chronic psychological characteristic rather than a discrete and episodic psychiatric condition."

Mean heart rate at onset of ischemia (ischemic threshold) had similar variability in women and men (p = 0.96), and harmonic regression analysis confirmed a significant circadian variation (p < 0.0001), with a trough at night and a peak during activity hours. Heart rate increased significantly in the 5 min before ischemia throughout the 24 h (p < 0.0001), with no gender differences in the pattern of preonset to onset heart rate changes over time (p = 0.52); the smallest differences were recorded in the middle of the night. The majority of ischemic episodes (80%) had a heart rate increase > 5 beats/min in the 5 min before ischemia, but there were no gender differences.Women with coronary artery disease have a pattern of ischemic activity and underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms very similar to men. The importance of increase in myocardial oxygen demand in the genesis of ischemia in both men and women is reflected by similar magnitude of heart rate increases before ischemia. The lower ischemic threshold during the nocturnal hours, when blood pressure is also lower, is consistent with a circadian variation in underlying coronary vascular tone."

After controlling for a variety of factors that might affect use of thrombolytic agents, younger age, absence of a history of either congestive heart failure or stroke, and experiencing a Q-wave AMI were associated with receipt of thrombolytic therapy in both men and women; having an anterior AMI also was associated with use of thrombolytic agents in men. Women without as compared with those with a history of angina pectoris were significantly more likely to receive thrombolytics. Men who had Medicare insurance were significantly less likely to receive thrombolytics than were men with other types of health insurance. When this analysis was restricted to patients who were seen in area-wide hospitals within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms suggestive of AMI, similar factors were associated with the receipt of thrombolytic agents in men and women. The results of this community-wide study suggest a marked increase over the 5-year study period in the use of thrombolytic therapy in both men and women, with a greater relative increase observed in women.

Significant multivariable disease predictors of cardiac death or myocardial infarction were use of nitroglycerin or insulin, ST-T wave changes, female gender, left ventricular hypertrophy, and a reversible thallium 201 defect. Receiver operating characteristics curves by use of the hazard score were comparable by gender. A probability threshold of .30 for cardiac death or myocardial infarction yielded a cut point of acceptable sensitivity and specificity for prompting medical management decisions. Below this threshold, the rate of follow-up diagnostic testing was 16.9% for women and 57.8% for men (p=.00001). Above this threshold, the rate of follow-up diagnostic testing was 40.6% for women and 64.3% for men (p= .04).Use of cardiac diagnostic services and cardiac event-free survival varies by gender in patients screened by noninvasive testing. For men at low risk of cardiac death or myocardial infarction, a statistically greater use of follow-up diagnostic testing was reported, thus reflecting more aggressive treatment and overuse of services for men as compared with women."

Data were collected in the home setting 1 and 4 months after hospital discharge.Data on 32 women experiencing a first AMI were matched on neuroticism and cardiac dysfunction with 32 men from the same sample.The following instruments were administered 1 and 4 months after hospital discharge: Self-Perception Inventory (self-esteem); Profile of Mood States (emotional distress); General Health Perceptions Questionnaire (health perceptions); Interpersonal Dependency Inventory (dependency); and the UCLA Social Support Inventory (social support). The Eysenck Personality Inventory (neuroticism) was administered at 1 month. Cardiac dysfunction was measured with data available from the hospital record. Functional class was measured at 1 month with the Specific Activity Scale. Self-report of demographics and return to work were obtained 1 and 4 months, respectively.Women experienced improved perceptions of current health whereas their ratings of prior health decreased. Overall emotional distress, anxiety, and depression decreased significantly over time in women. Women reported wanting, receiving, and giving more support than men did at 1 month and receiving and giving more support than men did at 4 months, although stress in support relationships rose over time. In men anxiety, depression, and health concern all decreased significantly over time whereas their ratings of prior health rose. The match between social support wanted and received decreased over time in males as did their satisfaction with the support received. Men reported a higher functional class than women at 1 month, but return to work at 4 months did not differ.Both women and men experienced improved psychologic adjustment within 4 months after AMI, although the specific areas of improvement differed. Return to work was comparable in spite of differences in functional class. The women appeared to activate their social support system more effectively than the men after AMI. Further research is needed to determine whether differences in social support contribute to adjustment that is better than what normative data predict for women."

Is there evidence for an increased risk for women?,Circulation,1995 Mar 15,Outcomes,Human,27,,"A number of studies have indicated that women who have a myocardial infarction have higher mortality rates than men. The purpose of the present study was to review the literature on sex differences in mortality after myocardial infarction to determine whether female sex is independently associated with lower survival.Reports were identified mainly through a MEDLINE search of the English-language literature from January 1966 through June 1994. Studies included were those comparing mortality after myocardial infarction between men and women, controlling at least for age and with more than 30 outcome events. After duplicate patient series were eliminated, 27 reports were included in our review. Crude rates were higher in women than in men during the early phase (in-hospital or first month), but control for age alone or in combination with other factors reduced sex differences in almost all studies. Unadjusted mortality rates among the survivors of the early phase were similar for men and women in most studies, and control for age and other factors resulted in an increased survival rate in women compared with men in several investigations, particularly those with a follow-up of > 1 year.Much of the increased early mortality after myocardial infarction in women is explained by the older age and more unfavorable risk characteristics of the women. In the long run, when differences in age and other risk factors are controlled for, women tend to have an improved survival compared with men."

However, whether or not there are important long-term differences in outcome between women and men after coronary angioplasty is not clear.A retrospective analysis was performed of 3027 consecutive patients (824 women and 2203 men) who underwent successful angioplasty and who have been followed continuously for a mean of 5.5 years (range, 0.5 to 14 years). Follow-up is 100% complete. Event-free survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and clinical end points were also examined by Cox proportional-hazards models to account for important baseline differences when appropriate. There was a trend toward lower survival among women during follow-up, but this was not significant (P = .06). The relative risk of death among women compared with men after adjustment for baseline differences was 0.94 (CI, 0.76 to 1.15; P = NS). No significant sex differences in occurrence of Q-wave myocardial infarction were observed. Women were less likely to remain free of angina after 10 years (34% versus 37%, respectively; P = .008), but after adjustment for baseline differences, this difference was not significant (relative risk of angina, 1.07; CI, 0.95 to 1.21). Women tended to have less coronary artery bypass surgery performed during follow-up (P = .06); adjusting for baseline differences made this difference more significant (relative risk, 0.79; CI, 0.64 to 0.96; P = .02). Among patients who were not treated in the setting of acute infarction, no sex differences in survival and freedom from myocardial infarction were noted.After successful coronary angioplasty, the long-term prognosis for women is excellent and is similar to that observed in men. Risk-adjusted survival did not differ significantly between the sexes, but less frequent use of subsequent surgical revascularization was observed in women."

We studied the role of sex in the prognosis of 1,600 patients with AMI aged 30 to 74 years in the population-based Minnesota Heart Survey. A 50% random sample was taken of all AMI patients hospitalized in 1980 and 1985 in the Twin Cities of Minnesota (Minneapolis-St. Paul) (1,168 men, 432 women). A multiple logistic regression model was used for predicting early death (within 28 days) and included baseline characteristics: sex, age, chest pain on admission, history of previous AMI, angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass surgery or hypertension, presence of heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias requiring direct-current shock, diabetes mellitus, valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, and levels of serum enzymes and blood urea nitrogen. Age-adjusted early mortality rate was significantly higher in women than men, but only in those aged < 65 years (12.5% of women vs 6.5% of men, p < 0.01) versus those aged > or = 65 years (19.5% vs 21.6%, p > 0.05).

Over a follow-up period of 3.3 +/- 2.0 years, 65 patients died from cardiac causes and 301 experienced cardiac events (death, reinfarction and revascularization). Overall, the 5-year cardiac mortality was 8%: that in females (12.4%) was significantly higher than that in males (6.6%) (p = 0.0073). The overall 5-year cardiac event-rate was 35%, with no significant difference between females and males (41.1% vs 33.3%). Univariate analysis revealed that differences in age (57.8 +/- 9.8 years in males vs 64.8 +/- 8.9 years in females, p < 0.0001), presence of smoking habit, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, heart failure, right coronary artery disease, nicorandil administration, hypolipidemic, diuretic and anti-hypertensive treatment, and warfarin administration were present between men and women. The mortality rate in elderly females tended to be higher than that in their male counterparts. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that number of diseased vessels, post-infarction angina and left main trunk disease were significant predictors for cardiac death in both sexes, while gender was not. Therefore, gender did not appear to affect the long-term prognosis after age-adjustment among patients with myocardial infarction in the Western part of Japan."

An analysis of clinical and scintigraphic variables.,Circulation,1995 Feb 15,Management,Human,567,,"Little information is available regarding the occurrence of perioperative and late cardiac events in women with vascular disease. The current study was performed to examine whether sex-specific differences exist in these outcomes in a large population of vascular surgery patients and to determine the value of clinical and dipyridamole thallium variables in predicting myocardial infarction and cardiac death.Preoperative dipyridamole thallium imaging was performed in 567 vascular surgery patients, including 380 men and 187 women. The incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiac death was noted during the perioperative period and during a follow-up period of 50 +/- 5 months. Fixed and reversible thallium perfusion abnormalities were more common in men than in women (P < .001 and P = .004, respectively). Perioperative cardiac event rates were similar in men and women, 8.4% and 7.5%, respectively (P = .07). A transient thallium defect was associated with an increased risk of cardiac events by 3.9-fold in men (CI, 1.5 to 10.2) and 5.5-fold in women (CI, 1.4 to 22). Various clinical factors also were predictive of events but demonstrated substantial sex differences. For example, dipyridamole-induced ST-segment depression was strongly associated with perioperative events in men but not in women. There were 22 nonfatal myocardial infarctions and 29 cardiac deaths in men during the follow-up period, with comparable event rates noted for women. Cardiac event-free survival rates also were similar for men and women (P = .40). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a history of heart failure was an important prognostic variable for both sexes, as was a fixed thallium defect. Significant sex differences in the predictive value of other clinical factors for late cardiac events was apparent.The present study demonstrates that (1) thallium perfusion defects are more common in men; (2) transient thallium defects are associated with perioperative myocardial infarction and cardiac death in both sexes; (3) long-term survival rates after vascular surgery are similar between men and women; (4) a fixed perfusion defect is predictive of late cardiac events in women, with a trend noted in men; and (5) sex-specific differences were noted with regard to the prognostic value of various clinical risk factors. Therefore, dipyridamole thallium plays a significant role in the assessment of perioperative and long-term prognosis for both male and female vascular surgery patients. On the basis of these observations, modifications in risk stratification based on sex may be appropriate for men and women with vascular disease."

After matching for the hospital of admission and adjusting for age, in-hospital mortality, health insurance, and hospital transfer rates (with white men as the referent), the odds ratios for cardiac catheterization were 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.87) for black men, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.83) for white women, and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68) for black women. Similar race-sex differences were noted for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery.Race and sex differentials in the rates of invasive cardiac procedures remained despite matching for the hospital of admission and controlling for other factors that influence procedure rates, suggesting that the race and sex of the patient influence the use of these procedures."

To determine gender-based differences in presentation, management, length of stay, costs, and prognosis after AMI, we studied 561 patients with AMI. Women were older, had systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a non-Q-wave AMI more frequently, whereas more men smoked cigarettes. Predictors of coronary angiography were: male gender (RR 1.9; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.1), chest pain at presentation (RR 1.8; 95% CI 1.0 to 3.3), recurrent angina (RR 4.1; 95% CI 2.5 to 6.8), admission via the emergency room (RR 0.2; 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3), and younger age. Gender did not predict mortality. Among presenting features, the predictors of length of stay were diabetes, prior coronary bypass and prior coronary angioplasty in men, and age alone in women. Pulmonary edema and need for coronary bypass during the hospital course were predictors of length of stay in men only. Among presenting features, predictors of cost were diabetes in men and congestive heart failure in women. Predictors of cost during hospitalization for men were pulmonary edema, coronary angiography, intraaortic balloon pump use, and coronary bypass; for women, they were peak levels of creatine kinase and coronary bypass. Thus, predictors of length of stay and hospitalization costs differ based on gender. Efforts at cost containment may need to be gender-specific."

Platelet-mediated thrombosis plays a role in the initiation of myocardial infarction and stroke. Citrated whole blood from male and female donors was perfused through an annular system over everted human umbilical artery segments. Comparisons were made between platelet adherence and thrombus formation on subendothelium, platelet aggregation in citrated whole blood, hematologic variables, and the bleeding time. Platelet spreading and adherence were approximately 22% greater with male blood (P < 0.001), whereas thrombus formation on subendothelium and collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation did not show sex-related differences. Platelet aggregation with adenosine diphosphate was greater in women, related to their lower hematocrit values. By contrast, in women hematocrit values showed a slight but significant positive correlation with platelet adherence on subendothelium. Fibrinogen was significantly correlated with collagen- and adenosine-diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and with platelet adherence, spreading, and thrombus formation on subendothelium. The mean bleeding time was slightly longer in women than in men (P = 0.118). Platelet aggregation was not associated with the bleeding time except for collagen-induced platelet aggregation in males; the latter was significantly correlated with platelet adherence and spreading in both sexes, while arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation predicted platelet adherence and spreading in males. Male blood shows enhanced primary hemostatic activity; this may predispose men to atherosclerosis."

Women will more often have angina preceding their first myocardial infarct, but have more unrecognized infarctions than men. Women will be older, have more concomitant disease and present later in the course of their acute myocardial infarction. Although myocardial infarction may have similar clinical presentations in men and women, there are some important differences such as an increased incidence of non Q-wave myocardial infarctions in women, and the higher rate of complication and immortality from a myocardial infarct. Women develop less collateral cardiac vessels, which may explain the increased rate of hemodynamic complications after a myocardial infarct. Both early and late survival rates are also affected by the advanced mean age of women when they do present with a myocardial infarct. There is less data regarding treatment modalities based upon gender differences but in general, it appears that women benefit from established treatment modalities in the acute setting and subsequent to the event. It has been determined that there are epidemiologic differences, but pathophysiologic and clinical factors specific to women in this setting have yet to be determined."

However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the basic science of gender difference in the setting of experimental myocadial infarction. Therefore, we performed a randomized study to determine whether there is a gender-related difference in infarct size as well as arrhythmias in an experimental model of myocardial infarction. Eleven male and 10 female adult rats were studied. All rats underwent 90 minutes of left main coronary occlusion and 4 hours of reperfusion. After 4 hours of reperfusion, the area at risk (AR) was delineated by dye injection and the area of necrosis (AN) was assessed by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The electrocardiogram was recorded for the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). The area at risk was similar between the two groups. Myocardial infarct size, expressed as a percentage of the area at risk, averaged 57.3 +/- 4.9% in male and 58.2 +/- 3.5% in female rats (p = NS). The incidences of VT and VF were similar between male and female rats during 90 minutes of ischemia. Thus, gender had no effect on the extent of myocardial injury in this model of ischemia/reperfusion. To the best of our knowledge this is the first prospective randomized experimental trial that has shown no effect of gender on myocardial infarct size."

Accuracy of the data was evaluated by auditing 726 randomly selected charts. The variables examined included age, sex, race, comorbidity (anemia, chronic liver disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, prior myocardial infarction), complications (left ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, conduction defects), insurance status, performance of cardiac catheterization, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and survival up to 3 years. Women were older, had longer hospital stay, and were more likely than men to have anemia, diabetes, hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, and Medicare or Medicaid insurance coverage. They were less likely than men to be admitted to a hospital equipped to perform invasive procedures or to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, prior myocardial infarction, or arrhythmias. After adjustment for these differences, women were less likely than men to have cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catheterization was associated with lower mortality. Women up to age 70 had higher 3-year death rates than men after adjustment for age, race, comorbidity, complications, and insurance type. This difference between men and women was somewhat diminished after the performance of cardiac catheterization and revascularization was taken into account. Unadjusted mortality was high in this study group.Women with acute myocardial infarction are less likely to have invasive cardiac procedures and have higher 3-year adjusted death rate up to age 70 than men."

This report reviews the information available to guide the selection of noninvasive test procedures for women with chest pain syndromes, highlighting clinical variables, particularly the characteristics of the chest pain and the coronary risk profile. Because coronary arteriography appears to be a major determinant of access to myocardial revascularization procedures, the less aggressive diagnostic evaluation of women with chest pain in general, and of those with abnormal noninvasive test results in particular, remains of concern.

However, no gender differences in the use of angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery performed during the index hospitalization were found (10% in men, and 8% in women). The main reasons for ineligibility for thrombolytic therapy were: late hospital arrival, absence of qualifying ST-T changes on admission electrocardiogram, and contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Hospital death was significantly lower in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy (37 of 456; 8%) than in those excluded from thrombolysis (70 of 540;13%) (p < 0.01).

Both familial correlations and genetic effects of DHEAS were investigated. First, maximum likelihood estimates of the sex-specific familial correlations (corrected for nonrandom ascertainment) suggested that there was significant heterogeneity between the two sampling types. This heterogeneity was isolated to the male sibling correlation, which was higher in the case than control families. Post hoc analyses suggested that the sibling group heterogeneity may be in part a function of age, since the control sample offspring were on average much younger than those in case families. No sex differences other than those for the siblings were noted in the familial correlations. Second, heritability was investigated in control families using a simple path model (TAU) that allowed for sex differences. The only significant model parameter was the sex-specific familiarity (combined polygenic and familial environmental effects), which was larger in females (74%) than in males (29%). In general, these analyses suggested that (1) DHEAS may play only a limited role in the increased risk for premature MI, and (2) the degree of heritable (familial) variation may be dependent on sex."

No statistically significant differences were seen between men and women with regard to the use of anticoagulants, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, nitrates, and thrombolytic agents. Marked increases over time (1975 through 1990) were seen in the use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, lidocaine, and nitrates in each of the sexes, while declines were seen in the use of digoxin and diuretics. Use of thrombolytic therapy increased between 1986 and 1990, whereas use of calcium channel blockers decreased over this period for both men and women.The results of this multihospital, population-based, observational study suggest that physician practice patterns in the pharmacologic treatment of men and women hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction are very similar."

A total of 3,148 patients hospitalized with validated initial AMI comprised the study sample. The age-adjusted incidence rates of initial AMI increased between 1975 and 1981 in the two sexes, with a marked decrease thereafter; these rates declined by 26% in men and by 22% in women between 1975 and 1988. The overall unadjusted in-hospital case-fatality rates after initial AMI were significantly higher in women (21.7%) than in men (12.7%). Age- and multivariable-adjusted in-hospital case-fatality rates, however, were not significantly different for men compared with women (multivariate-adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.70, 1.16). No clear trends in in-hospital case-fatality rates were observed in men or women over the periods under study. There were no significant sex differences in the age-adjusted long-term survival rates of discharged hospital survivors of AMI. The multivariate-adjusted risk of total mortality among discharged hospital survivors, however, was significantly increased in men (multivariate-adjusted OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.03, 1.39); neither of the sexes experienced an improvement over time in long-term prognosis.

There is little information as to the association of the unique Lp(a) apolipoprotein moiety (apo(a)) with CHD in either men or women. We therefore assessed the association of the apo(a) polymorphism and of Lp(a) with first acute myocardial infarction (MI) in a population-based case-control study in Jewish residents of Jerusalem between the ages of 25 and 64. The patients consisted of 238 men and 47 women hospitalized for a first acute MI in the 4 hospitals of Jerusalem serving the population (70% response rate among all first MI patients). The control subjects comprised 318 men and 159 women sampled from the national population registry and who were free of CHD (75% response). Lp(a) and apo(a) were measured in plasma stored at -20 degrees C for 6-24 months. Among men, plasma Lp(a) concentrations were higher in cases than controls in both univariate and multivariate analyses. The elevated risk was limited to the upper fifth of the Lp(a) distribution (unadjusted odds ratio = 1.65, P < 0.01 vs. the lower four quintiles, multivariable odds ratio = 1.82, P < 0.01). Among women, Lp(a) was not elevated in acute MI patients. Apo(a) isoforms with a B, S1 or S2 band (associated with higher Lp(a) values and having lower molecular weights) were more prevalent in female MI cases than controls (unadjusted odds ratio = 2.5, P = 0.016). This association could not be attributed to the higher Lp(a) concentrations associated with these isoforms and was not seen in men. In conclusion, our study points to an association of the apo(a) isoforms with acute MI in women, not evident in this population sample in men. Previously described associations of elevated Lp(a) with acute MI were confirmed in men but not in women. While the role of chance and inadequate statistical power cannot be excluded, the suggestion of a sex difference in the strength of these associations deserves further investigation, as does the question of whether apo(a) phenotype contributes to risk independently of Lp(a) level."

During the period under study there was a significant increase in use of each of the examined procedures during hospitalization for AMI in both men and women. Increasing use of multiple procedures was also seen for each of the sexes. After controlling for a variety of demographic and clinical factors that might affect utilization rates, men were marginally more likely to undergo radionuclide ventriculography, and significantly more likely to undergo Holter monitoring, exercise treadmill testing, cardiac catheterization, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty than women. However, there were no gender differences in the use of coronary artery bypass grafting. On the other hand, men were significantly less likely to undergo echocardiography. The results of this multihospital, population-based study suggest sex differences in the use of several diagnostic and revascularization procedures during hospitalization for AMI. These differences may be attributed to physicians' practice patterns, although gender bias in the delivery of medical care cannot be excluded. Temporal trends in increased overall use of these procedures raise questions about cost-effectiveness that need to be further addressed."

Coronary disease presentations included angina, coronary insufficiency (unstable angina), recognized myocardial infarction, unrecognized myocardial infarction, and coronary death. Less than 1% of subjects were lost to follow-up for overall mortality. Cox modeling was used to examine the sex differences in outcome for each coronary presentation. New nonfatal coronary disease developed in 750 men (mean age, 63 years) and 583 women (mean age, 67 years). After onset of angina, men were at greater risk than women for myocardial infarction (hazards ratio [HR], 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45 to 3.34) and coronary death (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.32 to 3.36) after adjustment for age and coronary disease risk factors. After a recognized myocardial infarction, there was a trend toward greater risk for overall mortality in women than men after adjustment for age and risk factors (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.08). In contrast, after an unrecognized myocardial infarction, men were at increased risk for death compared with women (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.28 to 3.15).Women fare at least as poorly as men after recognized myocardial infarction, whereas women have a more favorable outlook than men after the onset of angina or unrecognized myocardial infarction. The favorable outcome in women after angina and unrecognized myocardial infarction is due, in part, to greater misclassification of these coronary events in women than in men."

However, the impact of diabetes on survival in patients treated with fibrinolytic agents is still undefined. It is also not known whether the type of diabetes or gender affects prognosis.We analyzed prevalence and prognostic significance of a history of diabetes in patients enrolled in the GISSI-2 study, all of whom received fibrinolytic agents. The incidence of deaths in the hospital and at 6 months after study entry was computed for patients without diabetes and for insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients; relative risks were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis.Information on diabetic status was available for 11,667 patients, 94.2% of those randomized in the GISSI-2 study. The prevalence of diabetes was higher in women than in men (8.75% vs. 1.85%, p < 0.01 for insulin-dependent and 23.7% vs. 13.8%, p < 0.01 for noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients). The type of fibrinolytic agent did not affect mortality rates; the increase in in-hospital mortality of diabetic patients was moderate and similar for men with insulin- and noninsulin-dependent diabetes (8.7% and 10.1%, respectively, vs. 5.8% in nondiabetic patients); in women, mortality was markedly higher for insulin-dependent and only slightly higher for noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients (24.0% and 15.8%, respectively, vs. 13.9% for nondiabetic patients). The adjusted relative risks were 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.9) for insulin-dependent diabetic women and 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.8) for noninsulin-dependent diabetic men. The mortality rate after discharge showed a similar gender difference, and in insulin-dependent diabetic women, prognosis was ominous even in the absence of left ventricular damage before discharge.A history of diabetes is associated with a worse prognosis after myocardial infarction, even in patients treated with fibrinolytic agents. Gender and type of diabetes appear to be critical in affecting survival. In men, both insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetes are associated with a moderately higher mortality rate; in women, insulin-dependent diabetes is, in itself, a strong risk factor for death after myocardial infarction."

A total of 348 women were compared with 1,271 men enrolled in the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) trials.The reasons for gender differences in the management and prognosis of acute coronary artery syndromes remain poorly defined. The extent to which gender itself explains observed differences in outcome and use of diagnostic procedures remains unclear because confounding factors have not been specified.Patients < 76 years of age presenting within 6 h of onset of ischemic symptoms with electrocardiographic ST segment elevation and without contraindications to thrombolysis, previous infarction in the same distribution or cardiogenic shock were prospectively enrolled in Phases 1 to 3, 5 and 7 of the TAMI trials. All patients received recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, urokinase or a combination of both agents. Protocol-mandated cardiac catheterization was performed during the hospital period. Rescue coronary angioplasty was carried out for reperfusion failure at angiography 90 min after initiation of thrombolytic therapy. Coronary artery bypass grafting or coronary angioplasty was performed for clinical indications.Women were older than men (61.0 +/- 9.7 vs. 55.8 +/- 10.1 years, mean +/- SD) and had a higher incidence of many risk factors for adverse outcome after myocardial infarction. There were no differences in baseline hemodynamic variables or time to thrombolytic treatment. Rates of acute and predischarge infarct-related artery patency and global and regional left ventricular function were similar in the two groups. Rates of in-hospital coronary angioplasty (52.6% and 54.1%) and bypass graft surgery (20.4% and 22.0%) were comparable in women and men, respectively. Women had higher unadjusted rates of mortality (9.2% vs. 5.4%, p = 0.014), reinfarction (6.4% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.005) and hemorrhagic stroke (2.0% vs. 0.55%, p = 0.017) than did men during the hospital period. When adjusted for clinical and angiographic variables, differences in mortality and hemorrhagic stroke did not reach statistical significance, and the risk of reinfarction was only marginally associated with gender.In selected patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy and cardiac catheterization for acute myocardial infarction, adjusted mortality rates and utilization of postlysis revascularization are similar in women and men. However, women may be at increased risk for reinfarction."

In-hospital thrombolytic therapy, coronary angiography, angioplasty, and bypass surgery were examined, as were in-hospital complications and death.Women were older and more often had histories previous hypertension and previous congestive heart failure. Thrombolytic therapy was used less often in women, although information about eligibility for treatment was not available to determine if this difference was due to treatment bias or differences in eligibility. Both coronary angiography and coronary angioplasty were used less frequently in women. However, of patients who had coronary angiography, equal proportions of women and men received angioplasty and/or coronary bypass surgery. Hospital mortality was 16% for women and 11% for men, although this difference was diminished by age adjustment. Mortality was higher in women undergoing bypass surgery, but this difference, too, was less apparent after age adjustment.Despite high levels of risk factors and mortality, coronary angiography and angioplasty were used less often in women, although among those who underwent coronary angiography, there were no gender differences in the use of angioplasty or bypass surgery. Clearly, more needs to be known about decision making for coronary angiography, as this process seems to differ for women and men with acute myocardial infarction."

In these studies, conducted in Sweden, men were found to have about four times higher odds for coronary heart disease than women during a 12-year follow-up period (men, 1967 to 1979; women, 1968-1969 to 1980-1981). Controlling for differences in blood pressure, serum cholesterol, smoking, and body mass index only marginally altered the magnitude of the male-female difference. When waist:hip ratio, which predicted coronary heart disease rates in both sexes, was also considered, the sex difference in coronary heart disease risk was significantly reduced and virtually disappeared (odds ratios = 1.0-1.1; nonsignificant). The findings suggest that body fat distribution or a factor highly correlated with waist:hip ratio (genetic, hormonal, or behavioral) may help to explain the sex differences in coronary heart disease."

Adults aged 40 to 88 years (n = 197) were interviewed 1 to 2 years after their first MI. The Profile of Mood States was used to measure anxiety and depression, the Personal Resources Questionnaire was used to measure social support, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale was used to measure self-esteem, the Perceived Quality of Life scale was used to measure quality of life, and the Health Behaviour Scale was used to assess therapeutic regimen adherence. Cardiac rehabilitation participation was recorded from rehabilitation centre records. Subjective health appraisals were assessed using investigator-developed questions. Increased age was associated with higher depression scores, lower quality of life, less social support, less participation in formal cardiac rehabilitation, less therapeutic exercise and poorer general health. Women reported poorer health than men. Findings indicated older males may be at risk for lower social support and continued smoking after infarction. These findings suggest that the often-reported experience of middle-aged males post-MI cannot be generalized to all adults experiencing infarction."

Diagnostic evaluations should be approached somewhat differently in male and female populations, and gender should be one of the variables assessed when options for medical and surgical therapy are considered. Risk factor modification can be offered as a potentially effective form of therapy for coronary heart disease in women. These modifications would include cessation of smoking, avoidance of oral contraceptives in women greater than 35 years of age, hypertension control, and normalization of blood lipid profile and body weight. Risk factor modification may be particularly important in prevention of accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetic women. Prognosis after myocardial infarction is significantly worse in women despite better post-infarction left ventricular ejection fraction and higher incidence of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in that population. Definitive assessment of coronary anatomy and aggressive management of coronary heart disease should be considered in women judged to be at high risk. Little information is available regarding gender-specific responses to medical management of coronary heart disease. Women seem to have a less favorable short-term outcome after PTCA, but better long-term results. Coronary artery bypass grafting results appear to depend less on gender than on coronary anatomy, preoperative risk factors, and patient size, and thus should not be withheld from women."

Patients with chronic myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral infarction (CI), angina pectoris (AP), and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were identified by questionnaire. The results show that there is no age or sex dependency of PV in healthy participants, while hemoglobin shows the well-known sex difference. In contrast, PV increases continuously with age in the total population. In men, increased PV is found in untreated hypertension, in hypercholesterolemia, and in smokers. In women, it is raised in hypercholesterolemia and in gross obesity. Male MI patients and patients of both sexes after CI in particular show statistically significantly elevated PV. Finally, in male patients with chronic AP or patients of both sexes with PAD, PV is elevated and a tendency to higher Hb values is seen. These results confirm smaller clinical trials suggesting that blood fluidity is pathologically altered in patients with CV risk factors or diseases. Since impaired blood fluidity may worsen the hemodynamic situation, in particular in patients with limited vasomotor reserve, hemorheologic parameters may be of prognostic relevance.

Comparisons between sexes were made with age alone and age and estimated primary risk as confounders. Survival rate and reinfarction rate were calculated for a 5-year period of follow-up. Women with infarctions had higher serum cholesterol levels (p less than 0.001) and higher blood pressure values (p less than 0.001) but were less often smokers than men (p less than 0.001). The female patients also reported chest pain and dyspnea on exertion, and low physical activity both at work and during leisure time significantly more often than men; these differences remained after controlling for estimated primary risk. An overrepresentation of hypertension and diabetes prior to myocardial infarction was found among women below 45 years of age compared with men. A high frequency of women in this age group was also on sick leave or disability pension at onset of myocardial infarction, suggesting that mainly women with several risk factors including socioeconomic factors suffer an infarction at this age. No similar and consistent differences were found between women and men of older ages. The cumulative 5-year survival rate was 80% in women and 81% in men. Below age 45 the survival rate was lower among women than men (p less than 0.01). No sex difference was found in the recurrence rate of nonfatal reinfarctions.
