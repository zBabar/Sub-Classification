Data were ascertained from interviews (baseline and 90 days post stroke) and medical records. Functional outcome was measured as an average of 22 activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental ADL items (range, 1-4; higher scores worse function). Tobit regression was used to estimate sex differences and to identify confounding and modifying factors.Fifty-one percent were women. Median age was 71 (interquartile range, 59-80) years in women and 64 (interquartile range, 56-77) years in men. Median ADL/instrumental ADL score at 90 days was 2.7 (interquartile range, 1.8-3.6) in women and 2.0 (interquartile range, 1.3-3.1) in men (P<0.01); this difference remained after age-adjustment (P<0.001). Factors contributing to higher ADL/instrumental ADL scores in women included prestroke function, marital status, prestroke cognition, nursing home residence, stroke severity, history of stroke/transient ischemic attack, and body mass index; prestroke function was the largest contributor. Stroke severity modified the sex difference in outcome such that differences were apparent for mild to moderate but not severe strokes. After adjustment, women still had significantly worse functional outcome than men.These findings yield insight into possible strategies and subgroups to target to reduce the sex disparity in stroke outcome; demographics and prestroke and clinical factors explained only 41% of the sex difference in stroke outcome highlighting the need for future research to identify modifiable factors that contribute to sex differences."

It is unknown whether this is because of eligibility differences or the modifiable exclusion criterion of severe hypertension. Our aim was to investigate sex differences in r-tPA eligibility, in individual exclusion criteria, and in the modifiable exclusion criterion, hypertension.We included all ischemic stroke patients â‰¥18 years among residents of the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region who presented to 16-area emergency departments in 2005. Eligibility for r-tPA and individual exclusion criteria were determined using 2013 American Heart Association (AHA) and European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) III guidelines.Of 1837 ischemic strokes, 58% were women, 24% were black. Mean age in years was 72.2 for women and 66.1 for men. Eligibility for r-tPA was similar by sex (6.8% men and 6.1% women; P=0.55), even after adjusting for age (7.0% and 5.9%; P=0.32). Similar proportions of women and men arrived beyond 3- and 4.5-hour time windows, but more women had severe hypertension. There were no sex differences in blood pressure treatment rates among those with severe hypertension (14.6% women and 20.8% men; P=0.21). More women were >80 years and had National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) >25.Within a large, biracial population, eligibility for r-tPA was similar by sex. Women were more likely to have the modifiable exclusion criterion of severe hypertension but were not more likely to be treated. Women were more likely to have 2 of the 5 ECASS III exclusion criteria. Undertreatment of hypertension in women is a potentially modifiable contributor to reported differences in r-tPA administration."

In male rats, the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 reduces ischemia-induced endothelin type B (ETB) receptor upregulation, infarct size and improves acute neurologic function after experimental stroke. However, responses to this treatment in females and long-term effects on outcome are not known. Initial experiments used in vitro organ culture of cerebral arteries, confirming ERK1/2 activation and increased ETB receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in female cerebral arteries. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO, 120â€‰minutes) was induced in female Wistar rats, with U0126 (30â€‰mg/kg intraperitoneally) or vehicle administered at 0 and 24â€‰hours of reperfusion, or with no treatment. Infarct volumes were determined and neurologic function was assessed by 6-point and 28-point neuroscores. ETB receptor-mediated contraction was studied with myograph and protein expression with immunohistochemistry. In vitro organ culture and tMCAO resulted in vascular ETB receptor upregulation and activation of ERK1/2 that was prevented by U0126. Although no effect on infarct size, U0126 improved the long-term neurologic function after experimental stroke in female rats. In conclusion, early prevention of the ERK1/2 activation and ETB receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in the cerebral vasculature after ischemic stroke in female rats improves the long-term neurologic outcome.

To date the genetic association of VDR with ischemic stroke has not been explored. In the present study we aimed to evaluate the association between VDR gene variants and ischemic stroke in Asian Indian population. Overall, 557 subjects were investigated that included 313 ischemic stroke patients and 244 control subjects. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms of the VDR gene termed as Fok I, Apa I, Taq I and Bsm I were genotyped by using PCR-RFLP method. The genotype distribution of Bsm I polymorphism was found to deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in control subjects, and hence excluded from the study. Apa I and Taq I polymorphisms were not found to be associated with ischemic stroke. However, presence of ff genotype of Fok I was found to confer 2.97-fold risk of ischemic stroke (95% CI=1.16-7.63, P=0.02) as compared to FF genotype. This association was found to be independent of various demographic and important biochemical covariates including age, gender, smoking, alcohol intake, BMI, and serum glucose, lipid profile, insulin and HOMA-IR, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and plasma NOx levels [OR=2.27, 95% CI=1.25-4.09, P=0.01]. However, adjustment for lipid metabolites attenuated the genetic association [OR=1.68, 95% CI=0.75-3.78, P=0.21]. Fok I polymorphism was also found to be associated with total cholesterol levels; ff genotype carriers were found to have significantly higher cholesterol levels (203.56 Â± 30.50mg/dl) as compared to FF carriers (177.38 Â± 47.90 mg/dl) (P=0.04). On stratification by gender the genetic association between Fok I polymorphism and ischemic stroke remained significant in females only (OR=2.28, 95% CI=1.15-4.53, P=0.02). This genetic association was also found to attenuate on adjustment with lipid variables. In the present study we could associate the only known functional polymorphism of VDR i.e., Fok I, with ischemic stroke in a gender specific manner. Adjustment with lipid variables was found to attenuate this association indicating that impaired lipid metabolism may be the underlying mechanism of action of this polymorphism which leads to an increase in the risk of ischemic stroke. Further larger scale validations in other population are warranted in other population."

The current study demonstrates that splenectomy prior to experimental stroke eliminates sex differences in infarct volume and activated brain monocytes/microglia. In the periphery of both sexes, activated T cells correlate directly with stroke outcome while monocytes are reduced by splenectomy only in males. This study provides new information about the sex specific mechanisms of the peripheral immune response in neurodegeneration after stroke and demonstrates the need for representation of both sexes in basic and clinical stroke research.

We determined the impact of human cord blood-derived CD34(+)-enriched mononuclear cells (CBSC) intraperitoneally injected 48â€‰h after an ischemic stroke at postnatal day 12 by evaluating poststroke neurogenic niche proliferation, glial response, and recovery in CD1 mice. Percent brain atrophy was quantified from Nissl-stained sections. Density of BrdU, Iba-1, and GFAP staining were quantified in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). Immunohistochemistry for human nuclear antibody, human mitochondrial antibody, and human CD34(+) cells was done on injured and uninjured brains from CBSC- and vehicle-treated mice. Developmental neurobehavioral milestones were evaluated pre- and post-treatment. No significant differences in stroke severity were noted between CBSC and vehicle-treated injured animals. With a 1Ã—10(5) CBSC dose, there was a significant increase in subgranular zone (SGZ) proliferation in the CBSC-versus vehicle-treated stroke-injured male mice. SVZ glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression was increased contralaterally in injured females treated with CBSC but suppressed in injured males. Significant negative correlations between severity of the stroke-injury and spleen weights, and between spleen weights and SGZ proliferation, and a positive correlation between GFAP expression and severity of brain injury were noted in the vehicle-treated injured mice but not in the CBSC-treated mice. GFAP expression and SVZ proliferation were positively correlated. In conclusion, neurogenic niche proliferation and glial brain responses to CBSC after neonatal stroke may involve interactions with the spleen and are sex dependent. "

Whether this is related to a lower evidence-based statin or high-intensity statin use is not known. We used a national cohort of 972,532 patients with CVD (coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, and ischemic stroke) receiving care in 130 Veterans Health Administration facilities from October 1, 2010, to September 30, 2011, to identify the proportion of male and female patients with CVD receiving any statin and high-intensity statin. Women with CVD (nÂ = 13,371) were less likely than men to receive statins (57.6% vs 64.8%, p <0.0001) or high-intensity statins (21.1% vs 23.6%, p <0.0001). Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (99 vs 85Â mg/dl) were higher in women compared with men (p <0.0001). In adjusted models, female gender was independently associated with a lower likelihood of receiving statins (odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.71) or high-intensity statins (odds ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.80). The median facility-level rate of statin and high-intensity statin use among female patients (57.3% [interquartile rangeÂ = 8.93%] for statin, 20% [interquartile rangeÂ = 7.7%] for high-intensity statin use) showed significant variation. In conclusion, women with CVD are less likely to receive evidence-based statin and high-intensity statins compared with men, although, their use remains low in both genders. There is a significant facility-level variation in evidence-based statin or high-intensity statin use in female patients with CVD. With the ""statin dose-based approach"" proposed by the recent cholesterol guidelines, these results highlight areas for quality improvement. "

Only a few studies have directly addressed the interaction between the two hormone systems, however, there is a large literature that indicates potentially greater interactions between the 17b-estradiol and IGF-1 systems. The present review focuses on key issues related to this interaction including IGF-1 and sex differences and common activation of second messenger systems. Using ischemic stroke as a case study, this review also focuses on independent and cooperative actions of estrogen and IGF-1 on neuroprotection, blood brain barrier integrity, angiogenesis, inflammation and post-stroke epilepsy. Finally, the review also focuses on the astrocyte, a key mediator of post stroke repair, as a local source of 17b-estradiol and IGF-1. This review thus highlights areas where significant new research is needed to clarify the interactions between these two neuroprotectants. "

Compared to men, women wait longer for brain imaging and are less likely to receive intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Emergency department (ED) triage is an important step in the rapid assessment of stroke patients and is a possible contributor to disparities. It is unknown whether gender differences exist in ED triage of acute stroke patients. Our primary objective was to determine whether gender disparities exist in the triage of acute stroke patients as defined by Emergency Severity Index (ESI) levels and use of ED critical care beds.This was a retrospective, observational study of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients age â‰¥18 years presenting to a large, urban, academic ED within six hours of symptom onset between January 2010, and December 2012. Primary outcomes were triage to a non-critical ED bed and Emergency Severity Index (ESI) level. Primary outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records by a blinded data manager; secondary outcome data and covariates were abstracted by trained research assistants. We performed bivariate and multivariate analyses. Logistic regression was performed using age, race, insurance status, mode of and time to arrival, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and presence of atypical symptoms as covariates.There were 537 patients included in this study. Women were older (75.6 vs. 69.5, p<0.001), and more women had a history of atrial fibrillation (39.8% vs. 25.3%, p<0.001). Compared to 9.5% of men, 10.3% of women were triaged to a non-critical care ED bed (p=0.77); 92.1% of women were triaged as ESI 1 or 2 vs. 93.6% of men (p=0.53). After adjustment, gender was not associated with triage location or ESI level, though atypical symptoms were associated with higher odds of being triaged to a non-critical care bed (aOR 1.98, 95%CI [1.03 - 3.81]) and 3.04 times higher odds of being triaged as ESI 3 vs. ESI 1 or 2 (95% CI [1.36 - 6.82]).In a large, urban, academic ED at a primary stroke center, there were no gender differences in triage to critical care beds or ESI levels among acute stroke patients arriving within six hours of symptom onset. These findings suggest that ED triage protocols for stroke patients may be effective in minimizing gender disparities in care."

The association of on-study low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and CV events by gender was evaluated in the combined studies and the impact of gender on adverse events in each study separately. Major CV events occurred in 3,083 of 30,000 men (10.3%) and 823 of 9,173 women (9.0%). Changes in lipids were similar in women and men. Major CV events were associated with gender-specific quintiles of on-treatment LDL cholesterol for women and men. In women, LDL cholesterol was a significant predictor of stroke, but not in men. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were higher in women in 4 of 6 trials, but in only 1 trial was a significant treatment-gender interaction seen. Myalgia rates were slightly higher in women in both statin and placebo groups. In conclusion, the response of women to atorvastatin was similar to that of men, with slightly more discontinuations due to adverse events. Higher on-treatment LDL cholesterol was significantly associated with more CV events in both genders, but the association was stronger for stroke in women and for coronary heart disease death in men."

The four core genotype (FCG) mouse model, in which the testes determining gene, Sry, has been moved from Y chromosome to an autosome, was used to dissociate the effects of sex hormones from sex chromosome in ischemic stroke outcome. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in gonad intact FCG mice revealed that gonadal males (XXM and XYM) had significantly higher infarct volumes as compared with gonadal females (XXF and XYF). Serum testosterone levels were equivalent in adult XXM and XYM, as was serum estrogen in XXF and XYF mice. To remove the effects of gonadal hormones, gonadectomized FCG mice were subjected to MCAO. Gonadectomy significantly increased infarct volumes in females, while no change was seen in gonadectomized males, indicating that estrogen loss increases ischemic sensitivity. Estradiol supplementation in gonadectomized FCG mice rescued this phenotype. Interestingly, FCG male mice were less sensitive to effects of hormones. This may be due to enhanced expression of the transgene Sry in brains of FCG male mice. Sex differences in ischemic stroke sensitivity appear to be shaped by organizational and activational effects of sex hormones, rather than sex chromosomal complement. "

However, it is unclear whether ALDH2 polymorphisms are associated with stroke risk independent of alcohol consumption and whether such association is modified by sex. We evaluated sex-specific associations of a common ALDH2 polymorphism and alcohol consumption with stroke risk in a Korean population.We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 8,465 men and women, aged 40-69 years and free of stroke between June, 2001 and January, 2003, and followed for the development of stroke. We identified new cases of stroke, which were self-reported or ascertained from vital registration data. Based on genome-wide association data, we selected a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2074356), which shows high linkage disequilibrium with the functional polymorphism of ALDH2. We conducted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis considering potential risk factors collected from a baseline questionnaire.Over the median follow-up of 8 years, 121 cases of stroke were identified. Carrying the wild-type allele of the ALDH2 polymorphism increased stroke risk among men. The multivariate hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] of stroke was 2.02 [1.03-3.99] for the wild-type allele compared with the mutant alleles, but the association was attenuated after controlling for alcohol consumption. Combinations of the wild-type allele and other risk factors of stroke, such as old age, diabetes mellitus, and habitual snoring, synergistically increased the risk among men. Among women, however, the ALDH2 polymorphism was not associated with stroke risk.The prospective cohort study showed a significant association between a common ALDH2 polymorphism and stroke risk in Korean men, but not in Korean women, and also demonstrated that men with genetic disadvantages gain more risk when having risk factors of stroke. Thus, these men may need to make more concerted efforts to control modifiable risk factors of stroke."

Outcome measure was the occurrence of ischemic stroke ipsilateral to ICA stenosis. Myocardial infarction, contralateral stroke and transient ischemic attack were considered as competing events. The incidence rate of ipsilateral stroke over the entire follow-up period was 0.16%: 0.09% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.15) in women and 0.22% (95% CI 0.17 to 0.29) in men (log-rank test, P<0.001). Stenosis progression significantly influenced the risk of ipsilateral stroke in both men (subhazard ratio, SHR, 8.99) and women (SHR 4.89). Stenosis degree (71% to 90%, SHR 2.35; 91% to 99%, SHR 3.38) and irregular plaque surface (SHR 2.32) were relevant risk factors for ipsilateral stroke only in men. Our findings suggest that characteristics of the stenosis and plaque exert a different effect in modulating vascular risk in the two sexes. Understanding sex differences in cardiovascular disease could help to target sex-specific future therapies."

Biological sex is an important factor in predicting vulnerability of the brain to an ischemic insult, with males being at higher risk for cardio-cerebrovascular events than females of the same age. However, relative incidence of stroke between the genders appears to normalize at advanced ages. Therefore, many scientists have focused on the mechanisms of sex differences in outcome following brain ischemic injury, with a particular emphasis on the role of sex steroids. The majority of studies indicate that female sex steroids, such as estrogen and progesterone, play important roles in the relative neuroprotection following cerebral ischemia observed in females. However, less is known about male sex steroids and brain damage. This review describes the state of our knowledge of androgen-related contributions to neurological injury and recovery following cerebral ischemia that occurs following stroke.

For example, stroke occurs with greater frequency in men than in women across diverse ethnic backgrounds and nationalities. Work from our lab and others have revealed a sex-specific sensitivity to cerebral ischemia whereby males exhibit a larger extent of brain damage following an ischemic event compared to females. Studies suggest that the difference in male and female susceptibility to ischemia may be triggered by innate variations in gene regulation and protein expression between the sexes that are independent of post-natal exposure to sex hormones. We have shown that there are differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression in adult male and female brain following focal cerebral ischemia in mouse cortex. Herein we examine a role for differential expression of miRNAs during development in male and female rat cortex as potential effectors of the phenotype that leads to sex differences to ischemia. Expression studies in male and female cortices isolated from postnatal day 0 (P0), postnatal day 7 (P7), and adult rats using TaqMan Low Density miRNA arrays and NanoString nCounter analysis revealed differential miRNA levels between males and females at each developmental stage. We focused on the miR-200 family of miRNAs that showed higher levels in females at P0, but higher levels in males at P7 that persisted into adulthood, and validated the expression of miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-429 by individual qRT-PCR as these are clustered on chromosome 5 and may be transcriptionally co-regulated. Prediction analysis of the miR-200 miRNAs revealed that genes within the Gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor pathway are the most heavily targeted. These studies support that developmental changes in miRNA expression may influence phenotypes in adult brain that underlie sexually dimorphic responses to disease, including ischemia. "

In contrast to findings in males, G-1 reduced neurological deficit, apoptosis, and infarct volume in ovariectomized females, but had no significant effect in intact females.Future therapies for acute stroke could exploit the modulation of GPER activity in a sex-specific manner."

Compared with men with diabetes, women with diabetes therefore had a greater risk of stroke--the pooled ratio of RRs was 1Â·27 (1Â·10-1Â·46; I(2)=0%), with no evidence of publication bias. This sex differential was seen consistently across major predefined stroke, participant, and study subtypes.The excess risk of stroke associated with diabetes is significantly higher in women than men, independent of sex differences in other major cardiovascular risk factors.

The independent effects of sex on activities of daily living independence (Barthel Index â©_ 95) were analyzed. Our results showed that female stroke patients were older than male stroke patients and were more likely to have transient ischemic attack and hypertension. Male stroke patients were more likely to have a history of smoking, heart disease and dyslipidemia, while female patients were less likely to achieve daily living independence. The mean scores of physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health in the SF-36 survey were significantly higher in men than woman. Regression analyses confirmed that female sex was adversely associated with overall health status at discharge.

METHODS The data were extracted from the SaÃºde, Bem-Estar e Envelhecimento (SABE - Health, Wellbeing and Ageing) study. In 2000, 1,034 older adults without difficulty in regarding instrumental activities of daily living were selected. The following characteristics were evaluated at the baseline: sociodemographic and behavioral variables, health status, falls, fractures, hospitalizations, depressive symptoms, cognition, strength, mobility, balance and perception of vision and hearing. Instrumental activities of daily living such as shopping and managing own money and medication, using transportation and using the telephone were reassessed in 2006, with incident cases of disability considered as the outcome. RESULTS The incidence density of disability in instrumental activities of daily living was 44.7/1,000 person/years for women and 25.2/1,000 person/years for men. The incidence rate ratio between women and men was 1.77 (95%CI 1.75;1.80). After controlling for socioeconomic status and clinical conditions, the incidence rate ratio was 1.81 (95%CI 1.77;1.84), demonstrating that women with chronic disease and greater social vulnerability have a greater incidence density of disability in instrumental activities of daily living. The following were determinants of the incidence of disability: age â‰¥ 80 and worse perception of hearing in both genders; stroke in men; and being aged 70 to 79 in women. Better cognitive performance was a protective factor in both genders and better balance was a protective factor in women. CONCLUSIONS The higher incidence density of disability in older women remained even after controlling for adverse social and clinical conditions. In addition to age, poorer cognitive performance and conditions that adversely affect communication disable both genders. Acute events, such as a stroke, disables elderly men more, whereas early deficits regarding balance disable women more. "

The goal of this analysis was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating gender differences in residual risk of CVA/SE and major bleeding outcomes in patients with nonvalvular AF treated with either warfarin or NOAC. Sixty-four randomized studies were identified using keywords ""gender,"" ""AF,"" and ""CVA."" Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-analysis method, 6 studies met criteria for inclusion in this meta-analysis. CVA/SE and major bleeding outcomes were separately analyzed in cohorts receiving warfarin and NOAC agents, comparing men with women. Women with AF taking warfarin were at a significantly greater residual risk of CVA/SE compared with men (odds ratio 1.279, 95% confidence interval 1.111 to 1.473, Z = -3.428, p = 0.001). No gender difference in residual risk of CVA/SE was noted in patients with AF receiving NOAC agents (odds ratio 1.146, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.354, p = 0.109). Major bleeding was less frequent in women with AF treated with NOAC. In conclusion, women with AF treated with warfarin have a greater residual risk of CVA/SE and an equivalent major bleeding risk, whereas those treated with NOAC agents deemed superior to warfarin are at equivalent residual risk of CVA/SE and less major bleeding risk compared with men. These results suggest an increased net clinical benefit of NOAC agents compared with warfarin in treating women with AF."

Women were more likely to recognize all five traditional warning signs compared with men (67% vs. 42%; p = .04). Similarly, 58% of female participants recognized all five traditional stroke warning signs collectively and would call 9-1-1 as a first action compared with only 29% of men (p = .02).Although women recognized traditional stroke warning signs more often than men, educational programs should emphasize both traditional and nontraditional stroke warning signs among women and address these differences with their healthcare providers."

Collectively, they comprise almost two-third of the world's total mortality due to stroke. The purpose of this review is to explore existing epidemiological data on stroke, highlight the temporal trends in stroke epidemiology in various regions of Asia and predict future patterns based on these observations. Our search revealed that there is a lack of good epidemiological data from most Asian countries. Whatever data exist are not comparable due to lack of standardised methodology for ascertaining stroke and its subtypes. For this and other reasons, these estimates exhibit country-to-country variation and also within-country variability. We have also reviewed temporal trends in stroke incidence and prevalence in 12 Asian countries and the evolution of stroke subtypes over the past two decades. Important observations include a rise in stroke incidence in most Asian countries, an earlier age at onset compared with the West, a relative increase in the proportion of ischaemic strokes and a decline in haemorrhagic strokes. Among ischaemic stroke subtypes, lacunar strokes, which were once the commonest variety, are now declining. Emerging data suggest that large artery atherosclerosis and in particular that of intracranial vessels is the predominant aetiology in most Asian countries. The review also identified important gender differences in terms of stroke risk factors, prevalence and outcomes. There is need for sound epidemiological data from most countries to understand the disease better and plan policy-level interventions to decrease the burden. We identify a need for standard format or guidelines for conducting stroke epidemiological studies especially in developing Asian countries.

The search term 'atrial fibrillation' was used in combination with 'stroke risk', 'thromboembolism', 'female' and 'gender differences' and returned 735 articles, of which 17 were appraised and included. Females with AF were compared with males with AF for the outcome of stroke/thromboembolism.Seventeen studies, 5 randomized-controlled trials and 12 prospective observational studies were included; 10 demonstrated an increased risk of stroke in women. Meta-analysis of the 17 studies revealed a 1.31-fold (95% confidence intervals (CIs) 1.18-1.46) elevated risk of stroke in women with AF; the risk appearing greatest for women aged â‰¥75 years. Only three studies compared entirely anticoagulated populations; stroke rates among these patients varied from 1.2-1.44% per-patient year for men and 2.08-2.43% per-patient year for women. Risk of stroke in women appeared similar regardless of oral anticoagulation therapy [risk ratio (95% CI 1.29 (1.09-1.52) and 1.49 (1.17-1.90) in non-anticogulated vs. anticoagulated/mixed cohorts, respectively).Women with AF are at increased risk of stroke, particularly elderly women. Comprehensive stroke risk assessment, including sex as a risk factor, should be undertaken in all AF patients."

Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, prior stroke, and coronary heart disease was assessed in both genders by age groups. We analyzed gender differences of the prevalence among the age groups by calculating prevalence ratio, and further explored the influence of lifestyle factors on the gender difference in multivariable analyses.Hypertension and hyperlipidemia were more common in men until middle age, but after that more common in women, whereas diabetes was more common in women after 65 years of age. Atrial fibrillation increased steadily with age in both genders but was more common in women through all age groups. Prior stroke and coronary heart disease showed inconsistent gender differences. Gender differences in hypertension and diabetes among the age groups were attenuated by adjustment with accompanying risk factors including lifestyle factors.Korean women with stroke had more hypertension and hyperlipidemia after middle age, more diabetes after 65 years, and more atrial fibrillation throughout all ages.

Heart and circulatory physiology,2014 Apr,PP,Mouse,na,"Stroke risk and outcome are strongly modified by estrogen. In addition to ovaries, estrogen is produced locally in peripheral tissue by the enzyme aromatase, and extragonadal synthesis becomes the major source of estrogen after menopause. Aromatase gene deletion in female mice exacerbates ischemic brain damage after stroke. However, it is not clear which cell type is responsible for this effect, since aromatase is expressed in multiple cell types, including cerebrovascular endothelium. We tested the hypothesis that cerebrovascular aromatase contributes to sex differences in cerebrovascular endothelial function. Cerebrocortical microvascular responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator ACh were compared between male and female wild-type (WT) and aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice by measuring laser-Doppler perfusion in vivo through a closed cranial window. Additional studies were performed in WT mice treated with the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole or vehicle. WT female mice had significantly greater responses to ACh compared with WT males (P < 0.001), which was associated with higher aromatase expression in female compared with male cerebral vessels (P < 0.05). ACh responses were significantly lower in ArKO compared with WT females (P < 0.05) and in WT females treated with fadrozole versus vehicle (P < 0.001). Conversely, ACh responses were significantly higher in ArKO versus WT males (P < 0.05). Levels of phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were lower in ArKO versus WT female brains, but were not altered by aromatase deletion in males. We conclude that cerebrovascular endothelial aromatase plays an important and sexually dimorphic role in cerebrovascular function and that aromatase inhibitors in clinical use may have cardiovascular consequences in both males and females.

Little research has been done to investigate the combined influence of race and gender in the presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with AIS. We sought to determine the association of race and gender on initial stroke severity, thrombolysis, and functional outcome after AIS.AIS patients who presented to 2 academic medical centers in the United States (2004-2011) were identified through prospective registries. In-hospital strokes were excluded. Stroke severity, measured by admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), neurologic deterioration (defined by a â‰¥2-point increase in NIHSS score), and functional outcome at discharge, measured by the modified Rankin Scale, were investigated. These outcomes were compared across race/gender groups. A subanalysis was conducted to assess race/gender differences in exclusion criteria for tPA.Of the 4925 patients included in this study, 2346 (47.6%) were women and 2310 (46.9%) were black. White women had the highest median NIHSS score on admission (8), whereas white men had the lowest median NIHSS score on admission (6). There were no differences in outcomes between black men and white men. A smaller percentage of black women than white women were treated with tPA (27.6% versus 36.6%, P < .0001), partially because of a greater proportion of white women presenting within 3 hours (51% versus 45.5%, P = .0005). Black women had decreased odds of poor functional outcome relative to white women (odds ratio [OR] = .85, 95% confidence interval [CI] .72-1.00), but after adjustment for baseline differences in age, NIHSS, and tPA use, this association was no longer significant (OR = 1.2, 95% CI .92-1.46, P = .22). Black women with an NIHSS score less than 7 on admission were at lower odds of receiving tPA than the other race/gender groups, even after adjusting for arriving within 3 hours and admission glucose (OR = .66, 95% CI .44-.99, P = .0433).Race and gender were not significantly associated with short-term outcome, although black women were significantly less likely to be treated with tPA. Black women had more tPA exclusions than any other group. The primary reason for tPA exclusion in this study was not arriving within 3 hours of stroke symptom onset. Given the growth in incident strokes projected in minority groups in the next 4 decades, identifying factors that contribute to black women not arriving to the emergency department in time are of great importance."

Work from our lab and others have revealed a sex-specific sensitivity to cerebral ischemia whereby males exhibit a larger extent of brain damage resulting from an ischemic event compared to females. Previous studies revealed that microRNA (miRNA) expression is regulated by cerebral ischemia in males; however, no studies to date have examined the effect of ischemia on miRNA responses in females. Thus, we examined miRNA responses in male and female brain in response to cerebral ischemia using miRNA arrays. These studies revealed that in male and female brains, ischemia leads to both a universal miRNA response as well as a sexually distinct response to challenge. Target prediction analysis of the miRNAs increased in male or female ischemic brain reveal sex-specific differences in gene targets and protein pathways. These data support that the mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic responses to cerebral ischemia includes distinct changes in miRNAs in male and female brain, in addition to a miRNA signature response to ischemia that is common to both.

This is an important issue because nontraditional symptoms may delay the decision to get medical assistance and increase the difficulty of correct diagnosis. In the present study, we investigate sex differences in the stroke experience as described in stories on weblogs.The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using the Internet as a source of data for basic research on stroke experiences.Stroke experiences described in blogs were identified by using StoryUpgrade, a program that searches blog posts using a fictional prototype story. In this study, the prototype story was a description of a stroke experience. Retrieved stories coded by the researchers as relevant were used to update the search query and retrieve more stories using relevance feedback. Stories were coded for first- or third-person narrator, traditional and nontraditional patient symptoms, type of stroke, patient sex and age, delay before seeking medical assistance, and delay at hospital and in treatment.There were 191 relevant stroke stories of which 174 stories reported symptoms (52.3% female and 47.7% male patients). There were no sex differences for each traditional or nontraditional stroke symptom by chi-square analysis (all Ps>.05). Type of narrator, however, affected report of traditional and nontraditional symptoms. Female first-person narrators (ie, the patient) were more likely to report mental status change (56.3%, 27/48) than male first-person narrators (36.4%, 16/44), a marginally significant effect by logistic regression (P=.056), whereas reports of third-person narrators did not differ for women (27.9%, 12/43) and men (28.2%, 11/39) patients. There were more reports of at least 1 nontraditional symptom in the 92 first-person reports (44.6%, 41/92) than in the 82 third-person reports (25.6%, 21/82, P=.006). Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was reported in 67 and 29 stories, respectively. Nontraditional symptoms varied with stroke type with 1 or more nontraditional symptoms reported for 79.3% (23/29) of hemorrhagic stroke patients and 53.7% (36/67) of ischemic stroke patients (P=.001).The results replicate previous findings based on hospital interview data supporting the reliability of findings from weblogs. New findings include the effect of first- versus third-person narrator on sex differences in the report of nontraditional symptoms. This result suggests that narrator is an important variable to be examined in future studies. A fragmentary data problem limits some conclusions because important information, such as age, was not consistently reported. Age trends strengthen the feasibility of using the Internet for stroke research because older adults have significantly increased their Internet use in recent years."

Female stroke survivors experienced a faster prestroke memory decline than male stroke survivors (-0.14 vs. -0.10 points/year, p < 0.001). However, no sex differences were seen for other contrasts. Although whites had higher post-stroke memory scores than nonwhites, race was not associated with rate of memory decline during any period of time; i.e. race did not significantly modify the rate of decline before or after stroke or the immediate effect of stroke on memory.Older age predicted worse memory change before, at and after stroke onset. Sex and race differences in post-stroke memory outcomes might be attributable to prestroke disparities, which may be unrelated to cerebrovascular disease."

Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, and they respond to stroke by assuming an activated phenotype that releases cytotoxic cytokines, reactive oxygen species, proteases, and other factors. This acute, innate immune response may be teleologically adapted to limit infection, but in stroke this response can exacerbate injury by further damaging or killing nearby neurons and other cell types, and by recruiting infiltration of circulating cytotoxic immune cells. The microglial response requires hours to days to fully develop, and this time interval presents a clinically accessible time window for initiating therapy. Because of redundancy in cytotoxic microglial responses, the most effective therapeutic approach may be to target the global gene expression changes involved in microglial activation. Several classes of drugs can do this, including histone deacetylase inhibitors, minocycline and other PARP inhibitors, corticosteroids, and inhibitors of TNFÎ± and scavenger receptor signaling. Here we review the pre-clinical studies in which these drugs have been used to suppress microglial activation after stroke. We also review recent advances in the understanding of sex differences in the CNS inflammatory response, as these differences are likely to influence the efficacy of drugs targeting post-stroke brain inflammation.

Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether there were sex differences in clinical outcomes after ICH. Clinically important and biologically plausible risk factors of death or dependency were selected from available variables.A total of 615 ICH patients were enrolled.

Interestingly, mounting evidence has suggested potential sex differences in the response to stroke treatment in patients as, at least in part, distinct cell death programs may be triggered in females and males following stroke. The NIH has recognized that females are strikingly under-represented in pre-clinical trials. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) is a major kinase that is activated by elevated intracellular calcium. It has recently been suggested that CaMKK and CaMK IV, a downstream target molecule, are neuroprotective in stroke in males. In this study, we examined stroke outcomes in ovariectomized CaMKK Î_ and CaMK IV deficient females. Cell death/survival signaling and inflammatory responses were assessed.Our results demonstrated that CaMKK Î_ or CaMK IV KO exacerbated both ischemic injury and behavioral deficits in female mice. Genetic deletion of CaMKK Î_ or CaMK IV increased hemorrhagic transformation after stroke, and this was associated with both increased MMP9 activity and loss of the blood brain barrier (BBB) protein collagen IV. Transcriptional inactivation was observed in mice lacking either CaMKK Î_ or CaMK IV, as indicated by reduced levels of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) proteins. Finally, inhibiting this pathway exacerbated the inflammatory response to stroke as CaMKK Î_ or CaMK IV KO mice had increased levels of the pro-inflammatory serum cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) after stroke. This suggests that the CaMKK pathway is involved in the immune response to brain injury.Inhibition of CaMKK signaling exacerbated stroke outcome and increased BBB impairment, transcriptional inactivation and inflammatory responses in females after stroke. Therefore, CaMKK signaling may be a potential target for stroke treatment in both males and females."

Measures examining adherence to guidelines associated with nine areas of cardiovascular care (coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), stroke/transient ischemic attack, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking cessation, and weight management) were collected. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate sex differences, adjusting for age, physician remuneration, and rurality.Women were significantly less likely to have their lipid profiles taken (OR=1.17, 95% CI 1.03-1.33), be prescribed lipid lowering medication for dyslipidemia (OR=1.54, 95% CI 1.20-1.97), and to be prescribed ASA following stroke (OR=1.56, 95% CI 1.39-1.75).

RS (15-18 month old) and young (3-4 month old) female sEH knockout (sEHKO) mice and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to 45 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with laser Doppler perfusion monitoring. WT mice were treated with vehicle or a sEH inhibitor t-AUCB at the time of reperfusion and every 24 h thereafter for 3 days. Differences in regional cerebral blood flow were measured in vivo using optical microangiography (OMAG). Infarct size was measured 3 days after reperfusion. Infarct size and cerebral perfusion 24 h after MCAO were not altered by age. Both sEH gene deletion and sEH inhibition increased cortical perfusion 24 h after MCAO. Neither sEH gene deletion nor sEH inhibition reduced infarct size in young mice. However, sEH gene deletion, but not sEH inhibition of the hydrolase domain of the enzyme, decreased infarct size in RS mice. Results of these studies show that sEH gene deletion and sEH inhibition enhance cortical perfusion following MCAO and sEH gene deletion reduces damage after ischemia in RS female mice; however this neuroprotection in absent is young mice.

Further, electronic momentary assessment (EMA), a mobile technology, has not been used to assess stressful life events and PSD in real time and in the natural environments of daily life. The purpose of the current study was to examine gender differences in the relationship of stress and PSD using EMA.Individuals admitted to the Stroke Center at the University of Bordeaux were contacted for participation in a prospective study of symptoms and experiences in daily life using ambulatory monitoring. Forty-three post-stroke patients (47% female) completed electronic assessments of life events, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms (i.e., sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue, concentration difficulties, appetite change, negative thoughts, hopelessness) during their daily life for one week. Patients also completed a clinician-administered standardized depression scale at baseline and three-month follow-up.Using EMA, participants responded to 83.7% of the electronic interviews for a total of 1,140 observations across diverse daily life contexts. Stressful events of any degree of negativity were reported at over one-third (37.3%) of all EMA assessments. The severity of depressive symptoms as assessed in daily life through EMA was greater in women following stroke than in men. Further, there was a significant association between EMA-assessed depressive symptoms and daily life stress for women, but not men. This association was due primarily to three specific depressive symptoms: sad mood, fatigue, and appetite change. No difference was observed between men and women in standardized depression assessments administered during clinic visits at baseline or three-month follow-up.Greater reactivity to stressful life events and a link between stress reactivity and depressive symptoms were found in female as compared to male post-stroke patients. Gender differences in depressive symptoms were identified using EMA data collected during daily life as contrasted with the use of a standard assessment during clinic visits. Mobile technologies may help to identify important real-time behaviors and symptoms that are not observable by standard clinical assessments employed at regular clinic visits. Further, future research should examine the overall and gender-specific benefits of stress-based interventions to reduce the risk of PSD for adults."

During the subacute phase of stroke, the use of autologous cells offers effective and practical clinical application and is suggestive of the many benefits of using the aforementioned gender-specific cells. For example, in addition to being exceptionally immunosuppressive, testis-derived Sertoli cells secrete many growth and trophic factors and have been shown to aid in the functional recovery of animals transplanted with fetal dopaminergic cells. Correspondingly, menstrual blood cells are easily obtainable and exhibit angiogenic characteristics, proliferative capability, and pluripotency. Of further interest is the ability of menstrual blood cells, following transplantation in stroke models, to migrate to the infarct site, secrete neurotrophic factors, regulate the inflammatory response, and be steered towards neural differentiation. From cell isolation to transplantation, we emphasize in this review paper the practicality and relevance of the experimental and clinical use of gender-specific stem cells, such as Sertoli cells and menstrual blood cells, in the treatment of stroke.

We sought to determine the association between minimal depression, upper-extremity (UE) impairment, and UE motor function in a cohort of participants with subacute stroke. METHOD. We conducted a retrospective, secondary analysis of an interventional study. Correlational analyses were performed using the following outcome measures: the UE section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FM), the functional ability section of the Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). RESULTS. We found a negative correlation between BDI-II and both the FM (-.120, p = .196) and the AMAT (-.110, p = .275); however, this correlation was not statistically significant. Women exhibited higher depression scores (8.75 Â± 0.78) than men (6.29 Â± 0.46; p = .008). CONCLUSION. Low levels of depression are not associated with UE motor impairment and function in people with minimal to moderate UE disability levels. Poststroke depression occurs more frequently in women, warranting additional research on sex-specific differences. Given the proliferation of UE therapies targeting this group, this information is important for effective therapy planning and implementation. "

It is unclear what contributes to the gender-related differences in stroke and mortality amongst AF patients. This is pertinent since oral anticoagulation use results in a significant reduction in stroke, as well as all-cause mortality.We investigated gender-related risk factors for stroke and mortality in a cohort of Chinese patients with AF.We studied 1034 AF patients (27% females, median age 75 years) who were followed-up for an average of 1.9 years for the principal primary endpoint of 'ischaemic stroke and death'. Gender-specific effect of risk factors for stroke and death was analyzed.Patients at high stroke risk (CHADS2 or CHADS2-VASc â‰¥ 2) and HAS-BLED â‰¥ 3 had higher rates of ischaemic stroke and death, but ischaemic stroke rates in females with HAS-BLED â‰¥ 3 did not differ between CHADS2 0-1 and â‰¥ 2 (~3 per 100 person-years). On multivariate analysis of non-anticoagulated patients (n=885), independent predictors of 'ischaemic stroke and death' in both males and females were age>75, prior stroke and renal dysfunction (all p<0.05). Independent predictors of 'ischaemic stroke' in females were prior stroke, vascular disease and renal dysfunction (all p<0.05). When females were compared to males, adjusted for baseline characteristics, independent predictors for 'ischaemic stroke and death' amongst females were prior stroke (hazard ratio, HR 2.40; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.17-4.91, p=0.017) and renal dysfunction (HR 5.30; 95%CI 2.39-11.74, p<0.001). When females were compared to males, renal dysfunction remained a predictor for the secondary endpoints of ischaemic stroke (HR 4.37, p=0.05) and all-cause mortality (HR 4.15, p=0.003).Renal dysfunction may be a contributor to the greater risk of stroke and death in female Chinese patients with AF.

In addition, this review focuses on discussing the various pathologic mechanisms of ischemic stroke that may differ according to gender and compares how intrinsic and hormonal mechanisms may account for such gender differences. All clinical trials to date investigating putative neuroprotective treatments for ischemic stroke have failed, and it may be that our understanding of the injury cascade initiated after ischemic injury is incomplete. Revealing aspects of the pathophysiological consequences of ischemic stroke that are gender specific may enable gender relevant and effective neuroprotective strategies to be identified. Thus, it is possible to conclude that gender does, in fact, have an important role in ischemic stroke and must be factored into experimental and clinical investigations of ischemic stroke. "

In recent years, we have implicated the transient receptor potential M2 (TRPM2) channel as a mediator of ischemic injury to neurons. We previously demonstrated that genetic and pharmacological strategies that reduce TRPM2 function preferentially protect male neurons in vitro and reduce infarct volume following experimental stroke. Due to the narrow therapeutic window for intervention following ischemic stroke, it is important to assess the role of TRPM2 in other models of cerebral ischemia. Therefore, this study utilized a modified mouse model of CA/CPR to mimic more accurately the clinical condition by maintaining body and head temperatures near the physiological range throughout. Here, we report that inhibition of TRPM2 activity with clotrimazole reduces hippocampal CA1 neuronal injury when administered 30 min after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Consistent with our previous observations, neuroprotection was observed in male mice and no effect on injury was observed in the female.

Furthermore, the neuroprotection usually seen in younger females when compared to young males is not observed in older females. The preclinical literature thus provides a valuable resource for understanding why the aging brain is more susceptible to severe infarction.

Preventing NAD+ loss with nicotinamide reduced infarct in wild-type males and PARP-1 knockout mice of both sexes, with no effect in WT females. Caspase-3 activity was significantly increased in PARP-1 knockout females compared to males and wild-type females, this was reversed with nicotinamide.Sex differences exist in baseline and stroke-induced NAD+ levels. Nicotinamide protected males and PARP knockout mice, but had minimal effects in the wild-type female brain. This may be secondary to differences in energy metabolism between the sexes."

The aging of the population necessitates discovery of therapeutic innovations to combat debilitating disorders, such as stroke. Menstrual blood and Sertoli cells are two gender-specific sources of viable transplantable cells for stroke therapy. The use of autologous cells for the subacute phase of stroke offers practical clinical application. Menstrual blood cells are readily available, display proliferative capacity, pluripotency and angiogenic features, and, following transplantation in stroke models, have the ability to migrate to the infarct site, regulate the inflammatory response, secrete neurotrophic factors, and have the possibility to differentiate into neural lineage. Similarly, the testis-derived Sertoli cells secrete many growth and trophic factors, are highly immunosuppressive, and exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of neurological disorders. We highlight the practicality of experimental and clinical application of menstrual blood cells and Sertoli cells to treat stroke, from cell isolation and cryopreservation to administration."

Ten-minute electrocardiogram recordings were obtained (n = 4890), and analysed to detect AF. Self-reported arrhythmias, subjective and objective health measures (cardiovascular diseases, CHA2DS2-VASc variables and blood pressure) and medications were also recorded. Logistic regressions were used to determine associations with outcomes of presence of AF, lack of awareness and untreated AF.Overall prevalence of AF was 3% (95% CI: 2.4-3.7%), with a marked age gradient and sex difference [4.8% (men) vs. 1.4% (women); P < 0.0001]. In total, 67.8% were at high risk of stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc â‰¥ 2), of whom 59.3% were inadequately treated. A high proportion of 38.1% were unaware of having AF.

We developed a novel mouse model of experimental childhood-onset arterial ischemic stroke to characterize the sex-specific response of the adolescent brain to cerebral ischemia and assess the neuroprotective effect of estrogen at this developmental stage.Postnatal day 20 to 25 mice were subjected to 90 minutes experimental stroke via the intraluminal filament middle cerebral artery occlusion model and ischemic damage assessed 22 hours after reperfusion. Real-time quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed 22 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion to determine the effects of ischemia and estrogen treatment on the proapoptotic gene Bax.Ischemic injury did not differ between male and female juvenile (postnatal day 20-25) mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion. However, estrogen reduced ischemic injury in female mice, whereas having no effect in juvenile males. No differences in estrogen receptor expression were observed on postnatal day between 20 males and females. In contrast, estrogen minimized the ischemia-induced increase in the proapoptotic gene Bax in female mice, whereas having no effect on Bax induction in the male brain.Focal ischemia has fundamentally different effects in the juvenile brain compared with the adult, as evidenced by the lack of sex difference in ischemic injury in the murine postnatal day 20 to 25 middle cerebral artery occlusion model and the sexually dimorphic response to estrogen neuroprotection."

We have known for some time that the epidemiology of human stroke is sexually dimorphic until late in life, well beyond the years of reproductive senescence and menopause. The principal mammalian estrogen (17Î_ estradiol or E2) is neuroprotective in many types of brain injury and has been the major focus of investigation over the past several decades. However the incidence of stroke in women is lower than in men until decades past menopause, suggesting that factors beyond sex hormone contribute to these epidemiological sex differences. So a new concept is emerging: both sex steroids and biologic sex are important factors in clinical and experimental strokes. In this review, we will address sex steroids and gender differences in influencing the mechanisms and outcomes of brain ischemia stroke.

The neuroprotective role of estrogen in the female brain is well established, however, estrogen exposure can also be deleterious, especially in older women. The mechanisms for this remain unclear. Our current understanding is based on studies examining estrogen as it relates to neuronal injury, yet cerebral ischemia also induces a robust sterile inflammatory response involving local and systemic immune cells.

The incidence of stroke or ""brain attack"" is unlikely to recede for a decade at minimum by most predictions, despite large public health initiatives in stroke prevention. It has been well established that stroke is also one of the most strikingly sex-specific diseases in its epidemiology, and in some cases, in patient outcomes. For example, women sustain lower rates of ischemic stroke relative to men, even beyond their menopausal years. In contrast, outcomes are worse in women in many clinical studies. The biological basis for this sexual dimorphism is a compelling story, and both hormone-dependent and hormone-independent factors are involved, the latter of which is the subject of this brief review. Understanding the molecular and cell-based mechanisms underlying sex differences in ischemic brain injury is an important step toward personalized medicine and effective therapeutic interventions in patients of both sexes.

We performed this study with the aim to investigate geographic and sex difference in the distribution of ICAS in China.In this prospective multicenter study, we evaluated 2864 consecutive patients who experienced an acute cerebral ischemia within 7 days of symptom onset in 22 hospitals in China. All the inclusive patients underwent 3-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography and duplex color Doppler ultrasound or contrast-enhanced MR angiography to document the presence of intracranial or extracranial stenosis. Intracranial large-artery atherosclerosis was defined as â‰¥50% diameter reduction on MR angiography.The proportion of patients with ICAS was significantly higher in north China than in south China (50.22% versus 41.88%; P<0.0001). Patients in the north were likely to consume more alcohol and smoke more cigarettes and had significantly higher proportion of diabetes mellitus, family history of stroke, history of cerebral ischemia, heart disease, and higher body mass index. In patients aged >63 years, the percentage of ICAS in women was notably higher than in men (51.51% versus 45.40%; P=0.028). In elderly patients, women had higher proportion of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and heart disease than men.There exists geographic and sex difference in the distribution of symptomatic ICAS in China. Public health measures should strengthen improving social determinants of health and risk factor prevention/control in high-risk populations for decreasing stroke risk."

The aim of this study was to explore whether there were gender differences on clinical characteristics and outcomes in Chinese patients after ischemic stroke by using the data from the China National Stroke Registry (CNSR).Out of 12,415 consecutively recruited patients with acute ischemic stroke in the CNSR from 2007 to 2008, 11,560 (93.1%) patients were followed up for 12 months. Their clinical characteristics and outcomes on death, recurrence, and dependency were recorded. The multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine whether there were gender differences in these outcomes. Women were older than men at baseline (67.9 vs. 64.0 years, P<0.001). Women had a higher mortality, recurrence rate, and dependency rate at 3, 6, and 12 months than men, but after adjusting for age, history of diabetes, pre-stroke dependency, stroke severity, in-hospital complications, and other confounders, there were no statistically significant differences in gender on mortality and recurrence rate at 3, 6, and 12 months; and dependency rate at 3, and 6 months. However, the dependency rate at 12 months remained significantly higher in women (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.45).There are many differences in clinical characteristics between women and men after ischemic stroke in China. Compared with men, women are more dependent at 12 months after stroke. This difference still exists after controlling the potential confounders."

The contribution of hormones to these sex differences has been extensively debated. In experimental stroke, estradiol is neuroprotective, whereas androgens are detrimental. However, prior studies have only examined the effects of acute treatment paradigms; therefore, the timing and mechanism by which ischemic sexual dimorphism arises are unknown.The effects of exogenous neonatal androgen exposure on subsequent injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in adulthood in male rats were examined. Rats were administered vehicle (oil), testosterone propionate (TP) or the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 5 days after birth. At 3 months of age, a focal stroke was induced.Testosterone-treated rats (but not DHT-treated animals) had decreased infarct volumes (20 vs. 33%, p < 0.05) as well as increased estradiol levels (39.4 vs. 18.6 pg/ml, p < 0.0001) compared to oil-treated animals. TP-injected males had increased testicular aromatase (P450arom) levels (3.6 vs. 0.2 ng/ml, p < 0.0001) compared to oil-treated males. The level of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, the primary endogenous inhibitor of caspase-induced apoptosis, was increased in TP-treated rats compared with the oil-treated males.Neonatal exposure to exogenous testosterone upregulates testicular aromatase expression in male rats and leads to adult neuroprotection secondary to changes in serum estradiol levels and cell death proteins. This study suggests that early exposure to gonadal hormones can have dramatic effects on the response to adult cerebrovascular injury."

Mice lacking sEH globally are protected from injury following stroke; however, little is known about the role of endothelial sEH in brain ischemia. We generated transgenic mice with endothelial-specific expression of human sEH (Tie2-hsEH), and assessed the effect of transgenic overexpression of endothelial sEH on endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity and ischemic injury following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Compared to wild-type, male Tie2-hsEH mice exhibited impaired vasodilation in response to stimulation with 1 ÂµM acetylcholine as assessed by laser-Doppler perfusion monitoring in an in-vivo cranial window preparation. No difference in infarct size was observed between wild-type and Tie2-hsEH male mice. In females, however, Tie2-hsEH mice sustained larger infarcts in striatum, but not cortex, compared to wild-type mice. Sex difference in ischemic injury was maintained in the cortex of Tie2-hsEH mice. In the striatum, expression of Tie2-hsEH resulted in a sex difference, with larger infarct in females than males. These findings demonstrate that transgenic expression of sEH in endothelium results in impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the cerebral circulation, and that females are more susceptible to enhanced ischemic damage as a result of increased endothelial sEH than males, especially in end-arteriolar striatal region."

We previously found in males that cerebral ischemia upregulates contractile receptors in cerebral arteries, which is associated with lower blood flow. The present study investigates if cerebral arteries from men and women differ in cerebrovascular receptor upregulation.Freshly obtained human cerebral arteries were placed in organ culture, an established model for studying receptor upregulation. 5-hydroxtryptamine type 1B (5-HT1B), angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) and endothelin-1 type A and B (ETA and ETB) receptors were evaluated using wire myograph for contractile responses, real-time PCR for mRNA and immunohistochemistry for receptor expression.Vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II and endothelin-1 was markedly lower in cultured cerebral arteries from women as compared to men. ETB receptor-mediated contraction occurred in male but not female arteries. Interestingly, there were similar upregulation in mRNA and expression of 5-HT1B, AT1, and ETB receptors and in local expression of Ang II after organ culture.In spite of receptor upregulation after organ culture in both sexes, cerebral arteries from women were significantly less responsive to vasoconstrictors angiotensin II and endothelin-1 as compared to arteries from men. This suggests receptor coupling and/or signal transduction mechanisms involved in cerebrovascular contractility may be suppressed in females. This is the first study to demonstrate sex differences in the vascular function of human brain arteries."

This study investigated the association of red meat or poultry intake with risk of total and cause-specific mortality, including cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD), in two large population-based prospective cohort studies of 134,290 Chinese adult women and men in Shanghai. Meat intakes were assessed through validated food frequency questionnaires administered in person at baseline. Vital status and dates and causes of deaths were ascertained through annual linkage to the Shanghai Vital Statistics Registry and Shanghai Cancer Registry databases and home visits every 2-3 years. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of death associated with quintiles of meat intake. During 803,265 person-years of follow up for women and 334,281 person-years of follow up for men, a total of 4,210 deaths in women and 2,733 deaths in men accrued. The median intakes of red meat were 43 g/day among women and 54 g/day among men, and pork constituted at least 95% of total meat intake for both women and men. Red meat intake was associated with increased total mortality among men, but not among women; the HR (95% CI) comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles were 1.18 (1.02-1.35) and 0.92 (0.82-1.03), respectively. This sex difference was statistically significant (Pâ€_=â€_0.01). Red meat intake was associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease mortality (HRâ€_=â€_1.41, 95% CIâ€_=â€_1.05-1.89) and with decreased risk of hemorrhagic stroke mortality (HRâ€_=â€_0.62, 95% CIâ€_=â€_0.45-0.87).

In ICH, gender differences in outcomes remain relatively understudied but have been examined in other neurological emergencies. Further, a potential effect of age and gender on outcomes after ICH has not been explored. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that age and gender interact to modify neurological outcomes after ICH.Adult patients admitted with spontaneous primary supratentorial ICH from July 2007 through April 2010 were assessed via retrospective analysis of an existing stroke database at Duke University. Univariate analysis of collected variables was used to compare gender and outcome. Unfavorable outcome was defined as discharge to hospice or death. Using multivariate regression, the combined effect of age and gender on outcome after ICH was analyzed.In this study population, women were younger (61.1+14.5 versus 65.8+17.3 years, p=0.03) and more likely to have a history of substance abuse (35% versus 8.9%, p<0.0001) compared to men. Multivariable models demonstrated that advancing age had a greater effect on predicting discharge outcome in women compared to men (p=0.02). For younger patients, female sex was protective; however, at ages greater than 60 years, female sex was a risk factor for discharge to hospice or death.While independently associated with discharge to hospice or death after ICH, the interaction effect between gender and age demonstrated significantly stronger correlation with early outcome after ICH in a single center cohort.

Subjects with HAMD score of â‰¥7 were further assessed with the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Stroke severity was measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Stroke outcome was measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).One hundred and two stroke patients were recruited, only ninety-one patients completed del period (menâ€_=â€_53, 63.74%), with mean age 60.0Â±10.4 years (range, 34-82 years).

In univariate analysis gender, PSD was correlated with female gender. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, poor stroke outcome (mRSâ‰¥3) (OR 12.113, CI 1.169 to 125.59, P<0.05) was the important predictors of PSD.The study indicated that gender, functional dependence and stroke outcome are determinants of PSD occurrence during the first 2 weeks after stroke in China."

Data were obtained from patient files and the Central Civil Registration System. Age- and gender-specific incidence rates were estimated as cases/100,000 adults/year. Direct age-standardized incidence rate was calculated using the WHO 2000-2005 population as the standard.In 2011 and 2012, 156 cases of stroke were registered, 72 (46.2%) males and 84 (53.8%) females. The overall incidence rate of stroke was 155/100,000 person-years (95% CI 121-190), with ischemic stroke accounting for 89.1% of these. No significant differences were seen between men and women. Direct age-standardized incidence rate was 149/year/100,000 (95% CI 192-264).

Arterial geometry such as large IMT and large diameter may reflect vulnerable plaques and so impact stroke risk. Finally, arterial changes that exist bilaterally may increase stroke risk.We studied middle-aged men and women (n=7276) from a prospective observational study who had right (R) and left (L) CCA IMT and external diameters measured via B-mode ultrasound (1987-89) in order to categorize CCA geometry. Using side- and gender-specific IMT and diameter medians, we categorized each measurement as large (â‰¥ median) vs. not large (< median) and defined four geometries: both IMT and diameter were large, only one parameter was large, or neither was large (reference group). Participants were followed for first time stroke through December 31, 1999. We used proportional hazards models to assess associations between right and left CCA geometries with new stroke. We also calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios (+LR and -LR) for CCA bilateral phenotypes as a measure of diagnostic accuracy.Presence of both large CCA IMT and large diameter on one side was associated with strong stroke risk even after risk factor adjustment (men: RCCA hazard ratio [HR]=3.7 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.9-7.4; LCCA HR=2.4 95% CI=1.4-4.4; women: RCCA HR=4.0 95% CI=1.5-10.5; LCCA HR=5.7 95% CI=1.7-19.0).

We hypothesized that this is partly due to an inherent difference in susceptibility to ischemia between neurons from male vs. female brains. We tested whether neurons from male rodents are more susceptible to in-vitro ischemia than cells from females, and if this is related to increased expression of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). sEH contributes to neuronal cell death by inactivating neuroprotective epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs).Rodent cortical neurons were cultured, and exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD); then cell death was measured. EETs levels were determined by LC-MS/MS. Expression of sEH-encoding ephx2 was determined by qRT-PCR. Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and hydrolase activity assay assessed protein expression and activity.Cell death after OGD was higher in neurons from males vs. females, which correlated with higher ephx2 mRNA and stronger sEH immunoreactivity. However, EETs levels were similar in both sexes and pharmacological inhibition of the hydrolase domain of sEH did not abolish the sex difference in cell death. Genetic knockout of sEH in mice abolished the sex difference observed in neurons isolated from these mice after OGD.Cultured cortical neurons from females are more resistant to ischemia than neurons from males. Neurons from females have less sEH activity compared to neurons from males at baseline, although sEH levels were not measured after OGD. While pharmacological inhibition of the hydrolase domain of sEH does not affect cell death, knockout of the gene encoding sEH eradicates the sex difference seen in wild-type neurons, suggesting a role for further study of the lesser-known phosphatase domain of sEH and its role in sexual dimorphism in neuronal sensitivity to ischemia."

We pooled odds ratios (ORs) for leukoaraiosis in women vs men from published studies by fixed-effect meta-analysis, stratified by patient characteristics (stroke vs nonstroke) and CT vs MRI.Among 10 stroke studies (all CT-based), leukoaraiosis was most frequent in women (OR = 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-1.57, p < 0.0001), with little heterogeneity between studies (p = 0.28).

Moreover, excess leukoaraiosis in women on CT-imaging in OXVASC (1.38, 1.15-1.67, p = 0.001) was explained by their older age (age-adjusted OR = 1.01, 0.82-1.25, p = 0.90).

However, leukoaraiosis was independently associated with early mortality (hazard ratio = 1.46, 1.23-1.73, p < 0.0001), suggesting that comparisons in older age groups will be biased by prior premature death of men with leukoaraiosis. Sex differences in severity of leukoaraiosis were not addressed in previous studies.Previously reported excess leukoaraiosis in women with TIA/stroke is likely to be confounded by age and apparently greater severity in older women is likely to be biased by premature death in men with leukoaraiosis."

Glomerular filtration rate 60-90, 30-60, and 15-30 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2) was defined as mildly, moderately, and severely decreased GFR, respectively.There were 17,678 strokes, of which 72% were ischemic, 15% hemorrhagic, and 12% unspecified, during 12 years of follow-up. Hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for ischemic stroke were 1.09 (1.04-1.14) for mildly, 1.24 (1.10-1.39) for moderately, and 2.27 (1.63-3.17) for severely decreased GFR-Mayo. The corresponding figures for hemorrhagic stroke were 1.04 (0.93-1.15), 1.26 (0.96-1.64), and 2.31 (1.10-4.87). Ischemic stroke was related to all levels of decreased GFR-Mayo in both genders (P < 0.0003). Hemorrhagic stroke was only related to renal dysfunction among women; hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) 1.38 (1.14-1.66) for mildly, 1.70 (1.13-2.57) for moderately, and 3.46 (1.09-10.9) for severely decreased GFR-Mayo.Already mildly decreased GFR-Mayo increases the risk of ischemic fatal or non-fatal stroke and severely decreased GFR-Mayo the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in the general population. In gender-specific analyses ischemic stroke was related to a decreased GFR-Mayo in both genders. Hemorrhagic stroke was only related to renal dysfunction among women."

Mortality, stroke and composite event (stroke/death) were compared between procedures after matching of patients by propensity score. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was our secondary 'end' point.More than 90% of patients in both sexes were asymptomatic (27,439 women and 36,295 men). Compared to men, asymptomatic women experienced more strokes after CEA (women: 1.38%, men: 1.16%, P = 0.03) and higher AMI rates after both procedures (CEA; women: 0.75%, men: 0.51%, P = 0.0009, CAS; women: 0.96%, men: 0.28%, P = 0.01). Between procedures, symptomatic women undergoing CAS showed higher rates of mortality (CAS: 4.19%, CEA: 0.47%, P = 0.01) and combined (stroke/mortality) events (CAS: 12.09%, CEA: 6.05%, P = 0.02). In all other cohorts, no statistically significant difference was found between the procedures.Compared to CEA, CAS led to inferior in-hospital outcomes only in symptomatic women in the last decade in NYS. Men and asymptomatic women showed comparable outcomes after both procedures, whereas asymptomatic females were more prone to AMI after both interventions. These sex-associated differences should be taken into account for the treatment of carotid artery disease."

Geographic regions were defined as northern (Finland, Norway), central (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, The Netherlands, Switzerland), and southern (Greece, Italy, Turkey) Europe. Hierarchical regression models were used for comparisons.In the study cohort (n=3944), the 3 most frequent risk factors were current smoking (48.7%), dyslipidemia (45.8%), and hypertension (35.9%). Compared with central (n=1868; median age, 43 years) and northern (n=1330; median age, 44 years) European patients, southern Europeans (n=746; median age, 41 years) were younger. No sex difference emerged between the regions, male:female ratio being 0.7 in those aged <34 years and reaching 1.7 in those aged 45 to 49 years. After accounting for confounders, no risk-factor differences emerged at the region level. Compared with females, males were older and they more frequently had dyslipidemia or coronary heart disease, or were smokers, irrespective of region. In both sexes, prevalence of family history of stroke, dyslipidemia, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and atrial fibrillation positively correlated with age across all regions.Primary preventive strategies for ischemic stroke in young adults-having high rate of modifiable risk factors-should be targeted according to sex and age at continental level."

Over the last 20 years, antiplatelet agents have reduced overall stroke rates in primary and secondary prevention in men. However, this has not been the case for women. In this narrative review, the most widely used antiplatelet therapies for primary and secondary prevention in stroke, excluding cardioembolic stroke, will be outlined. First, the largest randomised controlled trials will be analysed as well as the enrolment percentages of women. Second, analyses on sex-interaction effects in each study will be examined. Moreover, the Authors will discuss the need to develop targeted antiplatelet therapies specifically for women. Based on current results, the most randomised clinical trials and meta-analyses on antiplatelet agents in cerebrovascular disease have not performed sub-analyses on sex-related differences and this is mainly because women were underrepresented. Despite this, antiplatelet agents are considered to be equally effective for both sexes in primary and secondary stroke prevention. Finally, aspirin is the most widely studied antiplatelet in women and has been shown to provide greater benefit for women as primary prevention of ischemic stroke without a significant increased risk in haemorrhage."

Despite a wide variety of clinical presentations, early diagnosis, mostly based on MRI/MRA, is crucial but often difficult particularly during post-partum because of the numerous causes of headache that may occur after delivery. Antithrombotic treatment based on low molecular weight heparin and symptomatic treatment should be started as rapidly as possible. The overall prognosis of CVT is much better than that of arterial stroke and it is even better in women with gender specific risk factors, with a complete recovery in 80% of patients.

The response rate was 51.7%. The majority of respondents (57.1%) were either overweight or obese, and 23.2% reported that they currently use tobacco products. Overall, accuracy on knowledge questions ranged from 0% to 90%, with a mean score of 57.8% (SD = 16%). Women in their 20s, minorities, and smokers had lower knowledge scores (P = 0.03, 0.022, and 0.009, respectively). Gender variations in symptoms and consequences of CVD for women were not widely understood by this group. Most knew that it is appropriate to respond rapidly to symptoms of heart attack or stroke. Increasing daily physical activity and managing stress effectively were picked most often as the behavioral strategies patients might initiate or increase to reduce their health risks.This was a convenience sample and the response rate was only 51.7%, so results maybe biased.This group's overall knowledge of CVD in women was poor, with most scores below 70%, and gaps in knowledge existed for minorities. These results are consistent with findings from national awareness surveys. Educational strategies need to include gender-specific risks, symptoms, and consequences, and they need to target tobacco users, minorities, and young adults. Resources are needed for obstetrician-gynecologists to use as they assist patients in becoming more aware of CVD and reducing personal risk through lifestyle modification."

More patients in JC certified centers were evaluated for thrombolysis than in noncertified centers. Delay in arrival was the commonest reason for not getting thrombolysis in both groups. More men than women had mild/resolving symptoms, had more interventional procedures, and better discharge outcome. More men were discharged on antithrombotics. Even after adjusting for age, gender differences were significant for arrival by ambulance, self transportation, mild/resolving symptoms, interventional procedures performed and marginally for good discharge outcome.There were significant gender differences in delivery of acute stroke care in Michigan hospitals even after adjustment for age differences.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of gender on the main clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of CADASIL.Cross-sectional data from 313 CADASIL patients including various clinical and cognitive scores and MRI parameters were compared between men and women, and between those younger and older than the median age of the population corresponding to the usual age of menopause (51 years).At younger than 51 years, migraine with aura was 50% more prevalent in women and stroke was 75% more prevalent in men. After the fifth decade, men had higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Rankin scores than women and more severe executive dysfunction, although global cognitive scores were similar. Age at first stroke, the number of stroke events, and the prevalence of dementia and psychiatric symptoms did not differ between men and women. Brain volume was lower in men with a trend for a larger volume of lacunar infarcts.In CADASIL, migraine with aura is more frequent in women and stroke is more frequent in men before the age of menopause. This difference seems to vanish after this age limit but may result in a higher degree of cognitive impairment and cerebral atrophy in men at the late stage of the disease.

EPA was significantly the most effective in reducing platelet aggregation in males at 2, 5 and 24Â h post-supplementation (-11%, -10.6%, -20.5% respectively) whereas DHA was not effective relative to placebo. In contrast, in females, DHA significantly reduced platelet aggregation at 24Â h (-13.7%) while EPA was not effective. An inverse relationship between testosterone levels and platelet aggregation following EPA supplementation was observed.Interactions between sex hormones and omega-3 fatty acids exist to differentially reduce platelet aggregation. For healthy individuals, males may benefit more from EPA supplementation while females are more responsive to DHA."

A possible impact of the patient's gender on the outcome of patients undergoing CAS has not been investigated properly and only little information about this topic is available so far.We analysed data of the German prospective, multicenter CAS Registry of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft leitende kardiologische KrankenhausÃ_rzte.From July 1996 to May 2009 5130 patients underwent CAS at 35 German hospitals and were enrolled into the prospective ALKK CAS Registry. Therefrom 1443 (28.1%) patients were female. There was no significant time-related difference in the proportion of women undergoing CAS over the years. Women undergoing CAS were significantly older than men (73 years vs. 70 years, p < 0.01) and had a longer in hospital stay in comparison to men (p < 0.01). The majority of patients treated with CAS was between 60 and 80 years of age (âˆ_73%).

22053957,No," F Liu,",Effects of chronic and acute oestrogen replacement therapy in aged animals after experimental stroke.,Journal of neuroendocrinology,2012 Feb,Management,Mouse,na,"The effect of oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT) on stroke incidence and severity has been extensively debated. Clinical trials of ERT have demonstrated an increased risk of stroke in treated women, although the study participants were well past menopause when therapy was initiated. It has been suggested that detrimental effects of ERT may be unmasked after prolonged periods of hypoestrogenicity. To date, very few studies have examined the effect of ERT in aged animals, although the timing of replacement may be critical to the neuroprotective effects of ERT. We hypothesised that chronic ERT initiated in late middle age would decrease infarct size in the brain after an induced stroke, whereas acute ERT would have no beneficial effects in aged females. To test this hypothesis, two paradigms of ERT were administered to aged mice of both sexes aiming to determine the effects on stroke outcome and to explore the possible mechanisms by which ERT interacts with age. Female mice that received chronic ERT from 17-20â€ƒmonths of age showed improved stroke outcomes after experimental stroke, whereas females that had acute ERT initiated at 20â€ƒmonths of age did not. Chronic ERT females exhibited diminished levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) translocation compared to acute ERT females after stroke. Acute ERT females demonstrated both an increase in nuclear NF-ÎºB and enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, a sexual dimorphic effect of ERT was seen because males benefited from ERT, regardless of the timing of initiation. Aged males had significantly reduced expression of pro-inflammatory markers after stroke compared to age-matched females, suggesting a pro-inflammatory milieu emerges with age in females. These results are consistent with the emerging clinical literature suggesting that ERT should be initiated at the time of menopause to achieve beneficial effects. The present study demonstrates the importance of using appropriate animal models in preclinical studies."

Metabolic syndrome was strongly associated with stroke risk only in males. In men, all constitutive metabolic syndrome components were continuously and strongly associated with CVD. In women, high-density lipoprotein and triglycerides did not appear to be associated with short term CVD risk.We found the newly defined consensus criteria for metabolic syndrome to be similarly predictive of cardiovascular events when compared to existing definitions. Significant gender differences exist in the association between metabolic syndrome, its individual components, and CVD."

Women were globally older than men (+5.2 years) and suffered more hypertension (P = 0.017) and atrial fibrillation (P < 0.001), although they were less likely to drink alcohol (P < 0.001), smoke cigarettes (P < 0.001), present hyperlipidemia (P = 0.033) or diabetes (P = 0.003) than men. Baseline stroke severity was not different between genders. Women suffered more cardioembolic strokes, while men had more atherothrombotic strokes. Moreover, women were less likely to receive stroke-related treatments, such as antiplatelets (P < 0.001), statins (P < 0.001), and tPA (P < 0.001) than men. Although meta-regression did not identify age or stroke etiology as sources of heterogeneity, caution should be taken as that analysis was possible only for gender differences in secondary prevention with antiplatelets because of limited data for other end points.Gender differences have been identified on the risk factors profile and diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with ischemic stroke.

We hypothesized that gender differences in ischemic stroke risk are related to TTR. From the AFFIRM database of 4,060 patients with AF, we determined the incidence of ischemic stroke by gender. We evaluated the INR at time of ischemic stroke and calculated TTR. We determined the relation between gender and ischemic stroke by TTR. Women had CHADS(2) Scores (3.7 Â± 1.3 vs 2.5 Â± 1.3, p <0.0001) and more ischemic strokes than men (5% vs 3%, odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.26, p = 0.002). Mean INR near time of ischemic stroke was 2 for women and men; median values were subtherapeutic (1.7 and 1.8, respectively). Women spent more time outside the therapeutic range (40 Â± 0.7% vs 37 Â± 0.5%, p = 0.0001), with more time below the therapeutic range (29 Â± 0.7% vs 26 Â± 0.5%, p = 0.0002). A higher TTR protected against ischemic stroke for women but not for men. Women who had a comparably high TTR (â‰¥66%) still had more ischemic strokes (p = 0.009). A fitted Cox proportional hazard regression model showed that gender, TTR <46% versus >80%, age, and previous stroke were significantly related to stroke incidence. In conclusion, women in AFFIRM were at greater risk of ischemic stroke than men, in part related to differences in TTR. Women with AF may benefit from more aggressive or novel anticoagulation to decrease their risk of stroke."

These sex differences have profound implications for effective prevention and treatment and are the focus of this review. Epidemiologic studies reveal a clear age-by-sex interaction in stroke prevalence, incidence, and mortality. While premenopausal women experience fewer strokes than men of comparable age, stroke rates increase among postmenopausal women compared with age-matched men. This postmenopausal phenomenon, in combination with living longer, are reasons for women being older at stroke onset and suffering more severe strokes. Thus, a primary focus of stroke prevention has been based on sex steroid hormone-dependent mechanisms. Sex hormones affect different (patho)physiologic functions of the cerebral circulation. Clarifying the impact of sex hormones on cerebral vasculature using suitable animal models is essential to elucidate male-female differences in stroke pathophysiology and development of sex-specific treatments. Much remains to be learned about sex differences in stroke as anatomic and genetic factors may also contribute, revealing its multifactorial nature. In addition, the aftermath of stroke appears to be more adverse in women than in men, again based on older age at stroke onset, longer prehospital delays, and potentially, differences in treatment."

The optimal periprocedural patient management for these interventions is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to identify factors delaying door-to-treatment times, and to evaluate the effect of a fast-track intubation standard operating procedure (I-SOP) on door-to-angiography time.First, we retrospectively reviewed records of 48 acute stroke patients who were treated by interventional recanalization of intracranial occlusions between 2006 and 2009 at our institution. Time to angiography was defined as time from hospital admission to the beginning of the angiographic procedure. Second, an I-SOP for fast-track intubation was implemented and effects on door-to-angiography time were prospectively analyzed in 23 consecutive patients.In the retrospective dataset (n = 48), the mean door-to-angiography time was 2.2 Â± 0.1 h (mean Â± SEM). A clinically relevant time loss attributable to the intubation procedure was suggested by a 51 Â± 21 min shorter door-to-angiography time for patients already intubated prior to admission (P = 0.0189). Additional factors associated with a prolonged door-to-angiography time were: door-to-diagnosis time (P < 0.001), onset-to-door time (P = 0.0117), and male gender (mean difference +27 Â± 15 min, P = 0.0822). In the prospective dataset (n = 23), I-SOP implementation reduced mean door-to-angiography time by 25 Â± 10 min (P = 0.0164).In acute stroke patients, intubation prior to interventional recanalization therapy can delay treatment initiation.

Although glial functions have been shown to affect the vulnerability of the brain, little is known if such a sex difference exists in glia, much less the mechanism that might cause gender-dependent differences in glial functions. In this study, we show that in vitro astrocytes obtained from either female or male pups show a gonadal hormone-independent phenotype that could explain the gender-dependent vulnerability of the brain. Female spinal astrocytes cleared more glutamate by GLAST than male ones. In addition, motoneurons seeded on female spinal astrocytes were less vulnerable to glutamate than those seeded on male ones. It is suggested that female astrocytes uptake more glutamate and reveal a stronger neuroprotective effect against glutamate than male ones. It should be noted that such an effect was independent of gonadal female hormones, suggesting that astrocytes have cell-autonomous regulatory mechanisms by which they transform themselves into appropriate phenotypes."

Five of these genes (VAMP7, CSF2RA, SPRY3, DHRSX, and PLCXD1) are located on pseudoautosomal regions of the human Y chromosome. The other 2 genes (EIF1AY and DDX3Y) are located on the nonrecombining region of the human Y chromosome.

Patient and procedural characteristics did not differ between women and men except for mean age (women, 70.1 years; men, 64.8 years; P = .003), hypertension (women, 78.0%; men, 65.5%; P = .021), and number of vertebrobasilar occlusions (women, 8/159 [5.0%]; men, 20/146 [13.7%]; P = .01). Revascularization was significantly associated with favorable outcomes in both women and men (P < .0001), and rates of favorable outcome, mortality, and sICH did not differ between women and men when the vessel was revascularized. Likewise, mechanical embolectomy with the Merci Retriever was not associated with different outcomes in women and men when the vessel was revascularized. Our data suggest that the sex differences seen in thrombolytic trials might be due to factors other than immediate postprocedural large vessel opening."

We assessed putative risk factors for CeAD including vascular risk factors, recent cervical trauma, pregnancies, and infections. All gender differences in the putative risk factors and outcome were similar in the CeAD and the non-CeAD IS groups.Our analysis of the largest collection of CeAD patients to date confirms male predominance and differences in age at dissection between men and women. Gender differences in putative risk factors may explain the higher frequency of CeAD in men and their older age, but the putative risk factors are probably not specific for CeAD."

We hypothesised that this is due to more benign carotid disease in women mediating a lower risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events. To test this, we investigated sex differences in the prevalence of MRI detectable plaque hemorrhage (MRI PH) as an index of plaque instability, and secondly whether MRI PH mediates sex differences in the rate of cerebrovascular recurrence.Prevalence of PH between sexes was analysed in a single centre pooled cohort of 176 patients with recently symptomatic, significant carotid stenosis (106 severe [â‰¥70%], 70 moderate [50-69%]) who underwent prospective carotid MRI scanning for identification of MRI PH. Further, a meta-analysis of published evidence was undertaken. Recurrent events were noted during clinical follow up for survival analysis.Women with symptomatic carotid stenosis (50%â‰¥) were less likely to have plaque hemorrhage (PH) than men (46% vs. 70%) with an adjusted OR of 0.23 [95% CI 0.10-0.50, P<0.0001] controlling for other known vascular risk factors. This negative association was only significant for the severe stenosis subgroup (adjusted OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.067-0.50) not the moderate degree stenosis. Female sex in this subgroup also predicted a longer time to recurrent cerebral ischemic events (HR 0.38 95% CI 0.15-0.98, Pâ€_=â€_0.045). Further addition of MRI PH or smoking abolished the sex effects with only MRI PH exerting a direct effect. Meta-analysis confirmed a protective effect of female sex on development of PH: unadjusted OR for presence of PHâ€_=â€_0.54 (95% CI 0.45-0.67, p<0.00001).MRI PH is significantly less prevalent in women. Women with MRI PH and severe stenosis have a similar risk as men for recurrent cerebrovascular events. MRI PH thus allows overcoming the sex bias in selection for CEA."

In a population-based stroke registry we analyzed etiological subgroups of ischemic stroke and calculated sex-specific incidence and mortality rates.The Ludwigshafen Stroke Study is a prospective ongoing population-based stroke registry. Multiple overlapping methods of case ascertainment were used to identify all patients with incident stroke or transient ischemic attack. Modified TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria were applied for subgroup analysis in ischemic stroke.Out of 626 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke in 2006 and 2007, women (n = 327) were older (73.5 Â± 12.6 years) than men (n = 299; 69.7 Â± 11.5 years; p < 0.001).

Evidences are accumulating that age and gender have great impact on the distribution of stroke risk factors. Such data are lacking in Chinese population. Methods. 1027 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke (IS) were recruited and divided into young adult (<50 years), middle-aged (50âˆ_80 years), and very old (>80 years) groups according to stroke onset ages. Vascular risk factors were collected and compared among groups. Results. Female patients were globally older than male patients at stroke onset and having higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM), heart diseases, and atrial fibrillation (AF). However, females were less likely to drink heavily or smoke than males. Young patients had a much higher proportion of smoking and drinking than middle-aged and very old patients and the highest family history of hypertension, while very old patients had the highest prevalence of heart diseases and AF but lowest proportion of positive family history of vascular diseases. Hypertension and DM were equally frequent among three groups. Conclusion. Our study showed that vascular risk factors had a specific age and gender distribution pattern in Chinese IS patients. Secondary prevention strategy should emphasize on the control of different risk factors based on patient's age and gender."
22752784,Yes," Wendy J van der Spuy,","Interrelation between inflammation, thrombosis, and neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia.",Reviews in the neurosciences,2012,Review,Human,na,"Stroke by mechanism of thrombotic cerebral ischemia is one of the leading causes of death and/or disability worldwide. Current research is under consensus that there are sex-based differences in both the prevalence and presentation of stroke and thrombosis. Here we discuss the interrelation between thrombosis and inflammation and call attention to points in the cerebral ischemic cascade where estrogen may be involved in neuroprotection. Cerebral ischemia triggers a series of events including inflammation, which is deeply interrelated with thrombosis; inflammation not only produces local thrombosis, but thrombosis can also amplify inflammation especially through the synergism of leukocyte and platelet activity. Research involving experimental animal models of cerebral ischemia has shown that sex hormones, especially estrogen, offer a degree of neuroprotection. Mechanisms of this neuroprotection may be linked to certain anti-inflammatory properties of estrogen, as well as estrogen's regulation of thrombosis through the lowering of coagulation factors, among others. It is also understood that sex hormones alter the function and morphology of platelets and fibrin networks, and changes in platelet and fibrin network morphology offer one of the earliest confirmations of inflammation. Sex hormone levels, inflammatory processes, and thrombotic mechanisms are profoundly interconnected in predicting the outcome of cerebral ischemia."

A degree of neurological deficit was quantified by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Functional outcome was assessed by the Motor Status Scale, Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory, Rivermead Mobility Index and Barthel Index.At the time of hospital admission there was no significant gender difference in clinical stroke severity. At discharge, we registered significantly better motor and functional recovery in men compared to women. Further, we found significantly better rehabilitation outcome in women with stroke in dominant left hemisphere (LH) than in women with stroke in subdominant right hemisphere (RH). Conversely, men with stroke in subdominant RH had significantly better rehabilitation outcome than men with stroke in dominant LH. Using a multivariate analysis we have found that men with stroke in RH had significantly higher probability to reach not only high response in mobility, but also more autonomy in ADL. The frequency of stroke in LH was significantly higher in both genders aged less than 51 years, as well as in women, while the frequency of stroke in RH was significantly higher in men.This paper places particular emphasis on substantial gender-based differences in functional recovery of patients with their first-ever unilateral stroke."

Yet, our knowledge of the role of work-related factors for the risk of stroke is fairly limited. In contemporary occupational health research, the Demand-Control Model (DCM) is frequently used to measure work stress. Previous literature reviews of the association of work stress and cardiovascular disease (CVD) do not include stroke as a specific outcome. Results regarding work stress and the risk of CVD are less evident in working women. With the focus on working women, the purpose of the present paper was to review the current research into the DCM in relation to stroke and to scrutinize potential gender differences. A literature search was performed and eight studies from three countries were identified. Based on the reviewed studies, there is some evidence that high psychological demands, low job control, and job strain are associated with increased stroke risk in women as well as in men. Any major reduction in deaths and disability from stroke is likely to come from decreasing social inequalities in health, and reducing work stress has a potential to contribute to a reduced risk of stroke in working populations."

Unlike all other causes of stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) occur more often in women and are thought to be a result of both hormonal influences and variation in wall shear stress. This paper retrospectively looks at a cohort of largely unruptured intracranial aneurysms to determine if there exists a gender discrepancy in the anatomic distribution of cerebral aneurysms.A retrospective review of consecutive patients with ruptured and unruptured intradural saccular cerebral aneurysms treated endovascularly was performed.Six hundred eighty-two aneurysms were treated. Seventy-two percentage of the patients were women and 27% of patients presented with SAH. Among women, most aneurysms were located along the ICA (54%) while men the ACA (29%, compared to 15% in women), a discrepancy evident in both unruptured and ruptured groups. Females tended to present later in life (59 vs. 55â€‰years), with multiple aneurysms (11 vs. 6% in men), and with SAH (28 vs. 23% in men) - the majority of these ruptured aneurysms were located at the ICA (42%), while men at the ACA (47%). Additionally, the majority (68%) of ruptured ICA aneurysms were PCOM.Understanding the natural history of aneurysms is imperative in treating incidentally found aneurysms. Significant differences exist between the genders in relation to aneurysm location, the most pronounced at the ICA and ACA. Previously described hormonal and hemodynamic theories behind cerebral aneurysm pathogenesis seem like plausible reasons to explain these differences."

The participants were without history of CVD and diabetes mellitus, and had reported stable dietary habits in the study questionnaire. Diet was assessed by a validated modified diet history method, combining a 7-d registration of cooked meals and cold beverages, a 168-item food questionnaire (covering other foods and meal patterns), and a 1-hour diet interview. Sociodemographic and lifestyle data were collected by questionnaire. iCVD cases, which included coronary events (myocardial infarctions or deaths from chronic ischemic heart disease) and ischemic strokes, were ascertained via national and local registries. Nutrient-disease associations were examined by multivariate Cox regressions.During a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, we identified 1,089 male and 687 female iCVD cases. High fiber intakes were associated with lower incidence rates of iCVD in women and of ischemic stroke in men. In post-hoc analysis, we discovered statistically significant interactions between intake of fiber and saturated fat; these interactions also differed between men and women (p<0.001).In this well-defined population, a high fiber intake was associated with lower risk of iCVD, but there were no robust associations between other macronutrients and iCVD risk.

Assessment also included measurements of nutritional and oral status, degree of independence, stroke severity, neglect and well-being.One hundred and four patients (53Â·8% women) were included in the study. The proportion of stroke patients with one or more eating difficulties was 81Â·7%. The most common eating difficulties were 'managing food on the plate' (66Â·3%), 'food consumption' (54Â·8%) and 'sitting position' (45Â·2%). Women had lower 'food consumption', more severe stroke (p = 0Â·003), worse functional status (p = 0Â·001) and lower quality of life (QoL) (p=0Â·038) than men. More women than men were malnourished and living alone. After adjustment for functional status and motor arm, the odds ratio of having difficulties with food consumption was four times higher among women than men (1Â·7-9Â·4, confidence interval 95%).More women than men with stroke suffered from inadequate food consumption. The women had more severe strokes, experienced poorer QoL and showed lower functional status than the men. In the rehabilitation process of women with stroke, these factors should be taken into consideration.Structured observation of meals, including assessment of food consumption, might be necessary in acute stroke care to detect patients, especially women, who might need closer supervision and nutritional intervention."
21091637,Yes," C Siegel,",NAD+ depletion or PAR polymer formation: which plays the role of executioner in ischaemic cell death?,"Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)",2011 Sep,Review,?,na,"Multiple cell death pathways are activated in cerebral ischaemia. Much of the initial injury, especially in the core of the infarct where cerebral blood flow is severely reduced, is necrotic and secondary to severe energy failure. However, there is considerable evidence that delayed cell death continues for several days, primarily in the penumbral region. As reperfusion therapies grow in number and effectiveness, restoration of blood flow early after injury may lead to a shift towards apoptosis. It is important to elucidate what are the key mediators of apoptotic cell death after stroke, as inhibition of apoptosis may have therapeutic implications. There are two well described pathways that lead to apoptotic cell death; the caspase pathway and the more recently described caspase-independent pathway triggered by poly-ADP-ribose polymers (PARP) activation. Caspase-induced cell death is initiated by release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, formation of the cytosolic apoptosome, and activation of endonucleases leading to a multitude of small randomly cleaved DNA fragments. In contrast caspase-independent cell death is secondary to activation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). Mitochondrial AIF translocates to the nucleus, where it induces peripheral chromatin condensation, as well as characteristic high-molecular-weight (50 kbp) DNA fragmentation. Although caspase-independent cell death has been recognized for some time and is known to contribute to ischaemic injury, the upstream triggering events leading to activation of this pathway remain unclear. The two major theories are that ischaemia leads to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) depletion and subsequent energy failure, or alternatively that cell death is directly triggered by a pro-apoptotic factor produced by activation of the DNA repair enzyme PARP. PARP activation is robust in the ischaemic brain producing variable lengths of poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) polymers as byproducts of PARP activation. PAR polymers may be directly toxic by triggering mitochondrial AIF release independently of NAD+ depletion. Recently, sex differences have been discovered that illustrate the importance of understanding these molecular pathways, especially as new therapeutics targeting apoptotic cell death are developed. Cell death in females proceeds primarily via caspase activation whereas caspase-independent mechanisms triggered by the activation of PARP predominate in the male brain. This review summarizes the current literature in an attempt to clarify the roles of NAD+ and PAR polymers in caspase-independent cell death, and discuss sex specific cell death to provide an example of the possible importance of these downstream mediators."

Emerging evidence suggests that innate cell sex is an important factor in cell death, with brain cells having sex-specific sensitivities to different insults. We used an in vitro model of isoflurane preconditioning and ischemia to test the hypothesis that isoflurane preconditioning protects male astrocytes while having no effect or even a deleterious effect in female astrocytes after subsequent oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD).Sex-segregated astrocyte cultures derived from postnatal day 0 to 1 mice were allowed to reach confluency before being exposed to either 0% (sham preconditioning) or 3% isoflurane preconditioning for 2 hours. Cultures were then returned to normal growth conditions for 22 hours before undergoing 10 hours of OGD. Twenty-four hours after OGD, cell viability was quantified using a lactate dehydrogenase assay.Isoflurane preconditioning increased cell survival after OGD compared with sham preconditioning independent of innate cell sex.More studies are needed to determine how cell type and cell sex may impact on anesthetic preconditioning and subsequent ischemic outcomes in the brain."

To determine whether this is due to improved survival, we assessed temporal trends in sex-specific in-hospital mortality after stroke.Individuals aged 35 to 64 years hospitalized in 1997 to 2006 with a primary discharge diagnosis of stroke (N=2 537 097) in the United States were identified by the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Temporal trends in sex-specific mortality after stroke and sex differences in mortality were assessed, before and after controlling for covariates.From 1997 to 2006, poststroke mortality decreased in both men (6.06% to 5.15%) and women (6.02% to 4.88%) aged 35 to 64 years. Unadjusted analysis revealed that women aged 35 to 44 years (odds ratio=0.89; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.95) and 45 to 54 years (odds ratio=0.93; 95% CI, 0.89 to 0.97) had lower mortality compared with men, whereas women aged 55 to 64 years had similar mortality compared with men. After adjustment for covariates, stroke type accounted for the better survival in women aged 35 to 44 years. After adjustment for covariates, women aged 45 to 54 years persistently had better survival than did men. Women aged 55 to 64 years had better survival than did men, once race and insurance type were accounted for.This study revealed a decline in stroke mortality rates from 1997 to 2006 among individuals aged 35 to 64 years. Better survival among women compared with men aged 35 to 54 years may partially explain the sex disparity in stroke prevalence."

We hypothesized that the improved survival in smokers is related to demographic differences and sought to further evaluate the gender disparities in smokers after an acute coronary event. A prospective cohort of 3,588 patients hospitalized at a single center from 1999 to 2006 was identified. Smoking status, in-hospital and 6-month follow-up death, and cardiovascular events (i.e., myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac-related rehospitalization, and unscheduled revascularization) were assessed. The prevalence of smoking in men increased over time. The smokers were younger at presentation with fewer co-morbidities than nonsmokers. Male smokers had lower mortality (3.2% vs 5.4%, p = 0.04) and fewer cardiovascular events (33.1% vs 42.4%, p = 0.003) at 6 months than nonsmokers. However, after adjusting for age and co-morbidities, smoking was not an independent predictor of events (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.17). Female smokers had mortality (5.6% vs 8.4%, p = 0.15) and cardiovascular events (54.5% vs 49.7%, p = 0.28) at 6 months similar to that of nonsmokers, with a nonsignificant trend toward increased risk after adjustment (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 1.93). Among smokers, female gender remained a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events at 6 months (odds ratio 2.35, 95% confidence interval 1.58 to 3.50), even after adjustment for age and co-morbidities. In conclusion, smokers experienced acute coronary event events earlier than did nonsmokers. Younger age and fewer co-morbidities likely account for most observed survival benefit in smokers, although female smokers are more likely to experience cardiovascular complications by 6 months than male smokers."

We directly assessed the involvement of TRPM2 channels in ischemic brain injury using pharmacological inhibitors and short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of TRPM2 expression. Each of the four TRPM2 inhibitors tested provided significant protection to male neurons following in vitro ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation, OGD), while having no effect in female neurons. Similarly, TRPM2 knockdown by TRPM2 shRNA resulted in significantly reduced neuronal cell death following OGD only in male neurons. The TRPM2 inhibitor clotrimazole reduced infarct volume in male mice, while having no effect on female infarct volume. Finally, intrastriatal injection of lentivirus expressing shRNA against TRPM2 resulted in significantly smaller striatal infarcts only in male mice following middle cerebral artery occlusion, having no significant effect in female mice. Data presented in the current study demonstrate that TRPM2 inhibition and knockdown preferentially protects male neurons and brain against ischemia in vitro and in vivo, indicating that TRPM2 inhibitors may provide a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of stroke in men."

The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at discharge were used to evaluate stroke severity. We determined the location of the infarct, the grade of white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and the prevalence of silent brain infarcts, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and smoking. We compared 2 groups, good outcome (mRS score 0-2) and poor outcome (mRS score 3-5), using multiple logistic regression analysis. We found significant differences between the 2 groups according to female sex (P = .04), WMH (P = .04), and NIHSS score (P < .001). After multivariate analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-11.4; P = .03), and NIHSS score (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.7-3.3; P < .001) were independently associated with poor outcome. Elderly onset, poor outcome, and hypercholesterolemia were more common in female patients, whereas smoking was more prevalent in males.

In intact males, stroke induces peripheral immunosuppression, characterized by decreased splenocyte numbers and proliferation and altered percentages of viable T, B, and CD11b+ cells. To investigate whether the potent androgen and known immunomodulator, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), exacerbates post-stroke immunosuppression in castrated male mice after focal stroke, we evaluated the effect of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) immune responses in castrated mice with or without controlled levels of DHT. MCAO reduced spleen cell numbers in both groups, but altered T cell and B cell percentages in remaining splenocytes and concomitantly increased the percentage of CD11b+ blood cells solely in DHT-replaced animals at 24 h. Furthermore, DHT-replacement reduced splenocyte proliferation which was accompanied by an increased percentage of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells relative to castrates 96 h post-MCAO. In brain, the percentages of immune cell populations in the ischemic hemisphere relative to the non-ischemic hemisphere were similar between castrated and DHT-replaced mice after MCAO. These data suggest DHT modulates peripheral immunosuppression after MCAO but with relatively little effect on early immune response of the recovering CNS."

Many of the detrimental effects of aging on ischemic stroke outcome in females can be replicated by ovariectomy, suggesting that hormones such as estrogen play a neuroprotective role. However, emerging data suggest that the molecular mechanisms leading to ischemic cell death differ in the two sexes, and these effects may be independent of circulating hormone levels.

However, few studies have examined the sex differences regarding the efficacy of these treatments. Specifically, recent studies have reported higher rates of perioperative complications during endarterectomy in women. Nonetheless, to date, the data on the effects of carotid artery stenting in women, coming from diverse studies and meta-analyses, have been limited owing to the small number of female patients examined. Owing to this, the evidence of the benefit for women is unclear. Peculiar pathophysiological aspects of stroke, the higher stroke risk in some specific periods in life (e.g., pregnancy, puerperium and older age) and worse documented stroke outcome in women suggest that sex does matter in stroke management. Thus, future randomized controlled trials need to be sex-balanced, in order to better understand the efficacy of appropriate secondary stroke prevention therapy in women."

Prior analyses of randomized trial data show strong evidence that women but not men receive statistically and clinically significant benefit from IV tPA treatment. Observational studies of the effectiveness of IV tPA treatment in men and women have limited validity because of the absence of comparable control groups.There is good evidence that there are clinically important sex differences in both the efficacy and utilization of IV tPA, with women gaining more benefit from treatment than men. The current paradox between greater efficacy but lower utilization of IV tPA in women requires greater attention from the stroke community. Larger placebo-controlled thrombolysis trials, specifically powered to look at sex differences in treatment efficacy, and more studies designed to understand the underlying reasons for the lower utilization of IV tPA in women are required."

A primary family caregiver was also enrolled and interviewed for each stroke survivor. Measures from the in-home evaluation included previously validated stroke outcomes assessments of neurological deficits, functional impairments, and patient-reported effects of stroke in multiple domains. Results- African American stroke survivors were less likely to be living with their primary family caregivers than white participants. Analyses that controlled for age, education, and whether the stroke survivors lived with their primary family caregivers indicated that African Americans and women showed significantly greater deficits on multiple 1-year outcome measures compared to whites and men, respectively.Among community-dwelling stroke survivors with family caregivers, women and African Americans are at heightened risk for poor long-term outcomes 1 year after first-time stroke events.

Sixty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 11 lipid-related genes were genotyped. Plaque presence and plaque subphenotypes, including multiple, thick, irregular, and calcified plaque, were analyzed. First, the interaction between each SNP and sex was evaluated for association with each plaque phenotype using multiple logistic regression and controlling for age, smoking, and the main effects of sex and SNP. For SNPs with suggestive evidence for interaction with sex (P<0.1 for the interaction term), stratification analysis by sex was performed to evaluate the sex-specific association between the SNP and plaque phenotypes.The most compelling finding is with the missense SNP rs11053646 (K167N) in the OLR1 gene, which encodes lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor.

Stroke-induced cell death in males is initiated by the mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor, resulting in caspase-independent cell death. In contrast, ischemic cell death in females is primarily triggered by mitochondrial cytochrome c release with subsequent caspase activation. Because X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) is the primary endogenous inhibitor of caspases, its regulation may play a unique role in the response to injury in females. XIAP mRNA levels were higher in females at baseline. Stroke induced a significant decrease in XIAP mRNA in females, whereas no changes were seen in the male brain. However, XIAP protein levels were decreased in both sexes after stroke. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) predominantly induce translational repression and are emerging as a major regulators of mRNA and subsequent protein expression after ischemia. The miRNA miR-23a was predicted to bind XIAP mRNA. miR-23a directly bound the 3' UTR of XIAP, and miR-23a inhibition led to an increase in XIAP mRNA in vitro, demonstrating that XIAP is a previously uncharacterized target for miR-23a. miR-23a levels differed in male and female ischemic brains, providing evidence for sex-specific miRNA expression in stroke. Embelin, a small-molecule inhibitor of XIAP, decreased the interaction between XIAP and caspase-3 and led to enhanced caspase activity. Embelin treatment significantly exacerbated stroke-induced injury in females but had no effect in males, demonstrating that XIAP is an important mediator of sex-specific responses after stroke."

Progesterone is a candidate neuroprotective factor for stroke; however, studies are lacking which: (i) study those groups representing high risk i.e. postmenopausal females; (ii) administer progesterone solely post-ischaemia; and (iii) combine histopathological and functional assessments. Postmenopausal females, along with males, represent the group at highest risk of cerebral stroke and can be modelled using aged or ovariectomized animals. In the current study, we aimed to determine the neuroprotective effects of progesterone administration following cerebral ischaemia in aged and ovariectomized mice. Following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, progesterone was administered at 1, 6 and 24 h post-ischaemia to aged and ovariectomized female mice. At 48 h post-ischaemia, progesterone significantly reduced the lesion volume (P < 0.05) but had no effect on neurological outcome in aged female mice. Whereas in ovariectomized mice, at 48 h post-ischaemia, progesterone treatment had no effect on the amount of lesion volume present but did significantly improve neurological outcome. In a further study of ovariectomized mice, allowed to survive for 7 days post-ischaemia, progesterone treatment significantly improved motor outcome as assessed using both the rotarod and grid test. In fact, by 7 days post-ischaemia, progesterone-treated ovariectomized mice did not differ significantly in performance compared with shams, whereas vehicle-treated ovariectomized mice displayed a significant functional impairment following ischaemia. The current study has demonstrated that progesterone has different neuroprotective effects whether it is administered to aged or ovariectomized female mice and emphasizes the need to combine histopathological and functional outcomes within the same study. In addition, as progesterone-only treatment may not improve all outcomes in all groups, therapies that combine progesterone with other neuroprotective candidates should be investigated to maximize benefit following stroke."
21602002,Yes," Niki Katsiki,","Stroke, obesity and gender: a review of the literature.",Maturitas,2011 Jul,Review,Human,na,"Cerebrovascular disease constitutes one of the main causes of morbidity, disability and mortality worldwide. Obesity, a major health problem reaching global epidemic proportions, is also associated with morbidity and mortality. The present review provides an update on the current knowledge regarding the association of gender and obesity with stroke prevalence and outcome. We also discuss the areas that future research needs to point towards. In general, gender differences in relation to stroke are increasingly being recognized and evaluated. Age-specific stroke incidence is generally higher in men, except in the elderly. Women are treated less frequently with intravenous thrombolysis compared with men stroke patients and the two genders seem to respond differently to aspirin and statins. Regarding obesity, although it is a well-known predictor of cardiovascular disease, there is a growing body of evidence revealing the presence of an inverse relationship between obesity and outcome in patients with stroke or established cardiovascular disease, the so-called obesity paradox. Further research is warranted on these important topics, as human population is continuously aging and becoming more obese. In this context, the causes of gender differences in stroke prevalence and outcome and the obesity-stroke paradox should be further investigated in future studies."

It was a descriptive type of cross sectional study, conducted on 177 stroke patients admitted in Mymensingh medical college hospital from February 2009 to March 2010. Patients were selected according to WHO stroke definition and confirmed by CT or MRI. The results of the study showed that Stroke was more common (58.19%) in male than female (41.8%), mean age of male stroke patients was 60.58Â±12.36 years and that of female was 63.58Â±13.62 years with no significant statistical sex difference. But after 70 years, females are more sufferer than male. Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation and dyslipidemia in male and female were equally present without significant difference, although male had a higher rate of smoking and previous stroke (p<0.05). Motor weakness was more in male than female and unconsciousness was more in female (p<0.05). Type and sub types of stroke showed no significant difference. Females had more severe stroke in terms of severity score (Scandinavian Stroke Scale) on admission. Duration of hospital stay were similar among male and female but on discharge functional scale (Modified Rankin Scale) score was higher in male (p<0.05) and in hospital mortality was higher in female (p<0.05) which was statistically significant."
21790339,Yes," Dawn M Meyer,",Sex differences in antiplatelet response in ischemic stroke.,"Women's health (London, England)",2011 Jul,Review,Human,na,"Sex differences exist in the occurrence, treatment and outcome of ischemic stroke. Compared with men, women have more stroke events and are less likely to fully recover from a stroke. Given the rapidly aging population, stroke incidence and mortality among women are projected to substantially rise by 2050. This has important public health consequences. Mitigating the burden of stroke among women will require a fundamental understanding of sex differences and sex-specific issues including cerebrovascular disease pathophysiology, treatment and outcome. An aspect of stroke treatment receiving increasing but insufficient attention involves possible interactions between estrogen levels, antiplatelet drugs and stroke outcome. Emerging evidence suggests that antiplatelet therapy may provide primary stroke protection but not primary myocardial infarction prevention in women, while the opposite may be true among men. Understanding sex-specific issues related to women who experience stroke is critical to clinicians who treat women with antiplatelet medications as part of a secondary stroke prevention regimen; however, the ideal antiplatelet medication, and dose, in women requires further research. In this article we present a conceptual framework for sex differences in antiplatelet treatment response in ischemic stroke, thrombus formation and the mediating role of estrogen, sex differences in antiplatelet treatment response in clinical trials, and sex differences in antiplatelet treatment use in ischemic stroke."

We therefore investigated the possible gender difference in brain damage after stroke associated with type 2 diabetes using a mouse model, KKAy. Female KKAy showed a much larger ischemic area compared with male KKAy. NADPH oxidase activity in the brain was also increased more in female than in male mice. Ovariectomy enhanced the ischemic area, and treatment with estradiol markedly attenuated the ischemic area to that in female KKAy, with a reduction of NADPH oxidase activity. Female and OVX mice showed improvement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) at 1 hour after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, but no significant difference in CBF of the ipsilateral penumbra and ipsilateral core 24 hours after MCA occlusion was observed among each group. Severe ischemic brain damage was observed in female KKAy compared with male KKAy. Estrogen showed a protective effect on the brain, at least partly from attenuation of oxidative stress in the female brain. These findings suggest that brain damage in diabetes mellitus might be more marked in women than in men."

We conducted a systematic review of all published studies (to August 2008) examining knowledge of stroke risk factors and warning signs that included women and provided results separated by gender. Two reviewers selected studies for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted data. The database search identified 2158 references for screening and 158 were selected for possible inclusion. Twenty-two studies were reviewed including 20 cross-sectional and two pretest-posttest design surveys. Overall, better stroke knowledge was observed in women compared with men in the majority of the studies although there is a general lack of knowledge in both genders. Four out of 18 studies reported better risk factor knowledge and eight out of 15 studies reported better knowledge in stroke warning signs in women compared with men. Women tended to know more evidence-based stroke risk factors than men. Stroke knowledge also appeared to be related to country of study origin, age, education, and medical history. Stroke knowledge among different populations and both in men and women is suboptimal. More research is necessary to further investigate gender differences in stroke knowledge with specific focus on how to use these differences to improve public health campaigns."

For each subject, their medical history was documented and tests for biochemical markers were performed. Multiple logistic regression analyses were separately conducted to assess the risk factors associated with ICAS by gender.The risk factors for asymptomatic ICAS were determined for every 10-year increase in age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-2.46), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.49-7.95), smoking (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.01-4.32), and hypercholesterolemia (OR = 3.31, 95% CI = 1.15-9.50) for male subjects; risk factors female subjects included hypertension (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.40-3.15) and DM (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.11-5.44). An additional stratified analysis indicated that there was no significant risk factor for male subjects aged <50 years, whereas hypertension (OR = 2.90, 95% CI = 1.57-5.37) was the significant risk factor for female subjects aged <50 years.

However, this protective ""preconditioning"" response to isoflurane is specific to males, with females showing an increase in brain damage following isoflurane preconditioning and subsequent focal cerebral ischemia. Innate cell sex is emerging as an important player in neuronal cell death, but its role in the sexually dimorphic response to isoflurane preconditioning has not been investigated. We used an in vitro model of isoflurane preconditioning and ischemia (oxygen and glucose deprivation, OGD) to test the hypotheses that innate cell sex dictates the response to isoflurane preconditioning and that 17Î_-estradiol attenuates any protective effect from isoflurane preconditioning in neurons via nuclear estrogen receptors. Sex-segregated neuron cultures derived from postnatal day 0-1 mice were exposed to either 0% or 3% isoflurane preconditioning for 1 h. In separate experiments, 17Î_-estradiol and the non-selective estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 were added 24 h before preconditioning and then removed at the end of the preconditioning period. Twenty-three hours after preconditioning, all cultures underwent 2 h of OGD. Twenty-four hours following OGD, cell viability was quantified using calcein-AM fluorescence. We observed that isoflurane preconditioning increased cell survival following subsequent OGD regardless of innate cell sex, but that the presence of 17Î_-estradiol before and during isoflurane preconditioning attenuated this protection only in female neurons independent of nuclear estrogen receptors. We also found that independent of preconditioning treatment, female neurons were less sensitive to OGD compared with male neurons and that transient treatment with 17Î_-estradiol protected both male and female neurons from subsequent OGD. More studies are needed to determine how cell type, cell sex, and sex steroids like 17Î_-estradiol may impact on anesthetic preconditioning and subsequent ischemic outcomes in the brain."

Cell death in males is initiated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation; however, manipulation of this pathway paradoxically increases ischemic damage in females. In contrast, females are exquisitely sensitive to caspase-mediated cell death. The effect of caspase inhibition in PARP-1 knockout mice was evaluated to determine if the detrimental effects of PARP deletion in females were secondary to increased caspase activation.Focal stroke was induced by transient or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in wild-type (WT) and PARP-1(-/-) mice of both sexes. The pan-caspase inhibitor, quinoline-Val-Asp(Ome)-CH2-O-phenoxy (Q-VD-OPh), was administered 90 minutes after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct size and neurological sores were assessed. Separate cohorts were used for protein analysis for PAR, Apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), caspase-9, and caspase-3.WT mice of both sexes had increased nuclear AIF after stroke compared to PARP-1(-/-) mice. PARP-1(-/-) females had higher mitochondrial cytochrome C and activated caspase-9 and -3 levels than WT female mice. PARP-1(-/-) females also had an increase in stroke-induced cytosolic cytochrome C release compared with WT females, which was not seen in males. Q-VD-OPh decreased caspase-9 in both males and females but only led to reduction of infarct in females. PARP-1(-/-) males had smaller infarcts, whereas PARP-1(-/-) females had larger strokes compared with WT. Q-VD-OPh significantly decreased infarct in both WT and PARP-1(-/-) females in both transient and permanent MCAO models, but had no effect in males.Deletion of PARP-1 reduces infarct in males but exacerbates injury in females. PARP-1(-/-) females have enhanced caspase activation. The detrimental effects of PARP loss in females can be reversed with caspase inhibition."

In both areas, clinical presentation received little attention (3 and 5%). Although publications progressively increased in both fields, an 8- to 10-year time gap emerged for stroke compared to MI. Last authors in both areas were predominantly men, but female last authorship is increasing more significantly over time in the field of stroke. Research on sex and gender differences in MI and stroke is largely underfunded, particularly by the EU.The data demonstrate how sex-/gender-specific research differs between specialties, most likely due to the diverse interest, funding opportunities and authorship distributions identified."

The objective was to investigate the genetic markers related to obesity genes FTO and MC4R and the gene of type 2 diabetes mellitus TCF7L2 for their contribution to risk of stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIA).We recruited 379 consecutive patients with stroke/TIA and 379 healthy population-based controls. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs9937053 (FTO), rs2229616 (MC4R V103I), rs17782313 (188kb downstream of MC4R), and rs7903146 (TCF7L2) were evaluated for association with stroke using logistic regression analyses.The odds ratios for stroke/TIA were 1.14 (95%CI 0.91-1.42) for rs9937053/FTO, 1.11 (95%CI 0.49-2.51) for rs2229616/MC4R, 1.05 (95%CI 0.82-1.3) for rs17782313/MC4R, and 0.99 (95%CI 0.78-1.25) for rs7903146/TCF7L2. Further exploration revealed that male patients with the T allele of rs7903146/TCF7L2 had a worse clinical outcome compared with male patients carrying the C allele.The observed trends of obesity risk alleles for risk of stroke/TIA as well as the possible sex-specific differences in clinical outcomes found for the TCF7L2 (rs7903146) require replication in future studies. Our study demonstrates that candidate gene studies for common stroke may benefit from focusing on polymorphisms that predispose to vascular risk."

The results were statistically analyzed for the genetic association of C-399T with ischemic stroke and clinical parameters.The TT genotype for C-399T was observed at a significantly lower frequency in stroke patients relative to control (CC+CT vs. TT, odds ratio [OR]=0.578, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]=0.360-0.927, P<0.05). This trend was also observed in female (OR=0.495, 95% CI=0.240-1.022) and older subjects (y>60, OR=0.556, 95% CI=0.304-1.018) with borderline statistical significance (P=0.0571 and P=0.0574, respectively). However, C-399T allele frequency was not different between controls and stroke patients in any groups. The C-399T polymorphism was found to be associated with body mass index and levels of some blood lipids.The C-399T NPY promoter polymorphism should be considered a genetic risk factor for ischemic stroke in the older adult and female Korean populations."

Medical records were abstracted for clinical data; 90-day follow-up events, including stroke, cardiovascular events, or death; CEA within 6 months; and postoperative 30-day outcomes. We assessed gender as a predictor of CEA and its complications adjusting for demographic and clinical variables as well as time to CEA between groups.Of 299 patients identified, 47% were women. Women were older with higher presenting systolic blood pressure and less likely to smoke or to have coronary artery disease or diabetes. Fewer women (36.4%) had CEA than men (53.8%; P=0.004). Reasons for withholding surgical treatment were similar in women and men, and there were no differences in follow-up stroke, cardiovascular event, postoperative complications, or death.

Initially, the levels of sex hormones were thought to be the major contributor to these sex differences, especially after puberty, when gonadal steroid levels sharply diverge between the sexes. More recently, it is recognized that sex differences also result from the organizational effects of sex hormone exposure early in development, even in the absence of hormone exposure later in life, as well as effects mediated by the sex chromosomes themselves. Epigenetic modifications of developmental genes important in sexual differentiation and the response to sex steroid hormones are also emerging as another important contributor to sex differences in disease expression. This review describes recent research on the relationship between hormones, organizational-activational effects of gonadal steroids, and epigenetic modifications in brain pathology, focusing specifically on cerebral ischemia."

FSS score correlated more strongly with the statement ""I have a lack of energy"" (r=0.470; ÏÅ<0.001; Spearman's rho) than with the statement ""I feel physical fatigue"" (r=0.349; ÏÅ=0.001). The statement ""I have a lack of energy"" also produced the highest prevalence of severe symptoms, with 37% agreeing that they had the symptom ""often"" or ""always."" Agreement between Likert scales was only fair, the best being that for ""I have a lack of energy"" and ""I feel physical fatigue"" (Îº=0.50). There was a gender difference in simple expression of fatigue, with the statement ""I feel physical fatigue"" correlating strongly with FSS score in males (r=0.61; ÏÅ<0.001) but not correlating in females (r=0.039; ÏÅ=0.29). Depending on which definition of fatigue was used, the prevalence of fatigue varied between 13% and 63%. FSS score correlated weakly with ESS score (r=0.287; ÏÅ=0.008).

The Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck & Steer, 1997), the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), and the Giessen Complaints List (BrÃ_hler & Scheer, 1995) were used to capture mental health and physical complaints in stroke survivors' spouses. Covariance analytical methods (analysis of covariance; ANCOVA) were conducted on data from both measuring times to test gender-related interaction effects.Generally, women caregivers reported more anxiety and depressive symptoms than did their men counterparts. However, 15 months after stroke onset, in cases where individuals with stroke had substantial cognitive and mental impairments, the opposite appeared to be true. The results supported the modified caregiving stress model. Women spousal caregivers seem to adjust better to cognitive and emotional changes in their partners than did caregiving husbands.The rehabilitation of stroke survivors may be more successful if gender differences in caregivers' adaptation to their partners' mental changes are taken into consideration in intervention programs for families of stroke survivors. Men spousal caregivers may need counseling aimed at supporting their adjustment to stroke-related cognitive and emotional changes in their wives."

The intervention was comprised of poster advertisements and various print media. Slogans and stroke interest stories appeared regularly in local newspapers, on television and radio and public events focussed on the subject. Even before the intervention, more women than men were able to name at least one stroke warning sign (71.3 vs. 57.8%, p < 0.01), to name the correct emergency call number (33.3 vs. 24.3%, p < 0.05) or to cite the correct action in acute stroke (""call emergency care"", 87.2 vs. 70.1%, p < 0.001). In some aspects women showed a generally better improvement of knowledge after the campaign (e.g. correct emergency call number: +5.7 vs. +1.2%, p < 0.05). Fewer women than men considered themselves as being at risk of stroke (30.9 vs. 36.9%. p < 0.01) with a significant increase following the intervention in both sexes (38.9/46.0%, p < 0.01). The perception of different educational media varied between the sexes. For example, female sex was independently associated with a better recall of poster advertisements and flyers in pharmacies and at the doctor's office (OR 1.44). Our data indicate that educational programs do have gender-specific effects. Women show a better stroke knowledge and in some aspects a better chance to gain information from classical broad educational interventions.

A similar trend has been seen in coronary heart disease, although recent reports suggest this decline might be levelling off in middle-aged adults.To investigate recent trends in stroke mortality among those aged 40-69 years in England.The authors used routine annual aggregated stroke death and population data for England for the years 1979-2005 to investigate time trends in gender-specific mortalities for adults aged 40 to 69 years. The authors applied log-linear modelling to isolate effects attributable to age, linear 'drift' over time, time period and birth cohort.Between 1979 and 2005, age-standardised stroke mortality aged 40 to 69 years dropped from 93 to 30 per 100,000 in men and from 62 to 18 per 100,000 in women. Mortality was higher in older age groups, but the difference between the older and younger age groups appears to have decreased over time for both sexes. Modelling of the data suggests an average annual reduction in stroke deaths of 4.0% in men and 4.3% in women, although this decrease has been particularly marked in the last few years. However, we also observed a relative rate increase in mortality among those born since the mid-1940s compared with earlier cohorts; this appears to have been sustained in men, which explains the levelling off in the rate of mortality decline observed in recent years in the younger middle-aged.If observed trends in middle-aged adults continue, overall stroke mortalities may start to increase again."

Women suffer more from cortical and non-traditional symptoms. Men and women benefit equally from thrombolysis and stroke unit care. Women with cardioembolic strokes may benefit more from anticoagulant therapy. Most studies have not found any tendency towards sexism in the choice of treatment. Post-stroke depression and low quality-of-life seem to be more common among women. Mortality rates are higher among men in some studies, while long-term ADL-dependency seems to be more common among women.Sex differences in stroke treatment and outcome are small, with no unequivocal proof of sex discrimination.

In this study we provide evidence in mice that this gender difference only occurs when the ischemic brain is reperfused. The limited tissue salvage achieved by reperfusion in male mice is associated with increased expression of proinflammatory proteins, including cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), Nox2, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and infiltration of Nox2-containing T lymphocytes into the infarcted brain, whereas such changes are minimal in female mice after ischemia-reperfusion (I-R). Infarct volume after I-R was no greater at 72 h than at 24 h in either gender. Infarct development was Nox2 dependent in male but not in female mice, and Nox2 within the infarct was predominantly localized in T lymphocytes. Stroke resulted in an approximately 15-fold increase in Nox2-dependent superoxide production by circulating, but not spleen-derived, T lymphocytes in male mice, and this was approximately sevenfold greater than in female mice. These circulating immune cells may thus represent a major and previously unrecognized source of superoxide in the acutely ischemic and reperfused brain of males (and potentially in postmenopausal females). Our findings provide novel insights into mechanisms that could be therapeutically targeted in acute ischemic stroke patients who receive thrombolysis therapy to induce cerebral reperfusion."

Men were more likely than women to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor monotherapy but just as likely to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretic combination. Women were more likely to be prescribed all other classes of antihypertensive therapy. Suboptimal adherence occurred in 32% of patients receiving thiazide diuretics, 25% for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and 38% for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretic combination. There were no sex differences in adherence to these antihypertensive therapies.

Beta-estradiol 3-benzoate (E(2)) capsule was implanted subcutaneously at 24 hours before infusion of FC. The severity of brain injury and neurological deficits were measured by histological quantification and forelimb asymmetry test, respectively. The role of thioredoxin (Trx) in E(2)-mediated neuroprotective effect was examined by intrastriatal administration of a Trx reductase inhibitor, 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and small interfering RNA.FC induced greater brain injury in male rats than females. E(2) treatment reduced FC-induced brain injury in both sexes. E(2) significantly increased protein level and activity of Trx in the caudate nucleus of females but not males. Administration of female rats with 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or Trx small interfering RNA to the caudate nucleus decreased the protective effect of E(2) against FC-induced injury. The protein and mRNA levels of estrogen receptor alpha, but not estrogen receptor beta, were more abundant in the caudate nucleus of female rats.Increase of brain Trx activity might play an important role in the E(2)-mediated neuroprotective effect against FC-induced brain injury in female rats. Understanding of the sex differences in the Trx-mediated neuroprotective effect by E(2) might help in improving treatment of brain dysfunction after hemorrhagic stroke and/or head trauma."
20088729,No," Valeria Caso,",Gender differences in patients with acute ischemic stroke.,"Women's health (London, England)",2010 Jan,Epidemiology,Human,1136,"Stroke has a greater effect on women than men owing to the fact that women have more stroke events and are less likely to recover. Age-specific stroke rates are higher in men; however, because of women's longer life expectancy and the much higher incidence of stroke at older ages, women have more stroke events than men overall. The aims of this prospective study in consecutive patients were to assess whether there are gender differences in stroke risk factors, treatment or outcome. Consecutive patients with ischemic stroke were included in this prospective study at four study centers. Disability was assessed using a modified Rankin Scale score (>or=3 indicating disabling stroke) in both genders at 90 days. Outcomes and risk factors in both genders were compared using the chi(2) test. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify any independent predictors of outcome. A total of 1136 patients were included in this study; of these, 494 (46%) were female. Women were statistically older compared with men: 76.02 (+/- 12.93) and 72.68 (+/- 13.27) median years of age, respectively. At admission, females had higher NIH Stroke Scale scores compared with males (9.4 [+/- 6.94] vs 7.6 [+/- 6.28] for men; p = 0.0018). Furthermore, females tended to have more cardioembolic strokes (153 [30%] vs 147 [23%] for men; p = 0.004). Males had lacunar and atherosclerotic strokes more often (146 [29%] vs 249 [39%] for men; p = 0.002, and 68 [13%] vs 123 [19%] for men; p = 0.01, respectively). The mean modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months was also significantly different between genders, at 2.5 (+/- 2.05) for women and 2.1 (+/- 2.02) for men (p = 0.003). However, at multivariate analysis, female gender was not an indicator for negative outcome. It was concluded that female gender was not an independent factor for negative outcome. In addition, both genders demonstrated different stroke pathophysiologies. These findings should be taken into account when diagnostic workup and treatment are being planned."

Studies performed in various parts of the world have found differences between sexes in stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, and outcomes. Although men are at higher risk of stroke for most age groups below age 85 years, after this age the incidence reverses dramatically, with women being much more at risk. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that women have worse recovery than men post-stroke. Many aspects of recovery may influence this outcome, including sex-specific comorbidities, aggressiveness of acute treatment, prevention therapies, and varying degrees of social support and rates of depression. It is important to further define and investigate sex differences in stroke incidence, care, treatment, and outcomes to improve functional recovery in women."

There have been surprisingly few studies investigating gender difference in the efficacy of pharmacological preconditioning, despite the known ability of oestradiol to exert neuroprotectant activity. We explored this paradigm using a mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. C57BL/6 mice both male and female received either 2 h of 70% xenon (preconditioning) or 70% nitrogen (control) balanced with oxygen. Twenty-four hours later animals underwent 1 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion and then allowed to recover. After a further 24 h, functional neurological outcome and cerebral infarct size were evaluated. Western blotting was used to detect activity of signalling pathways involving hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and phospho-Akt for the preconditioning effect. Both xenon preconditioned male and females showed improved functional outcome on focal deficit scales (P<0.05). Cerebral infarct volumes were significantly reduced in both xenon treated male and females (P<0.01). There was no significant difference between the male and female cohorts. HIF-1alpha and phospho-Akt were quantitatively upregulated in both sexes. Our data suggested that xenon preconditioning improved histological and neurological functional outcome in both gender in a stroke model of mice."

Subjects were followed for 6-9 years. Fatal and nonfatal strokes were ascertained from the Danish National Register of Patients. Cox proportional hazards model was used to describe vital exhaustion as a potential risk factor for stroke.Four hundred nine validated strokes occurred. A dose-response relationship between vital exhaustion score and the risk of stroke was found in women reaching a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.27 (95% confidence interval: 1.42-3.62) for the group with the highest score. HR was only slightly attenuated by multivariate adjustment. There was no association between vital exhaustion score and stroke in men. HR was strongest for ischemic stroke, whereas no association was seen for hemorrhagic stroke.Vital exhaustion, a measure of fatigue, conveyed an increased risk of ischemic stroke in women, but not in men, in this study sample."

We estimated the independent effect of gender and age on prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and calculated age and gender-specific prevalence rates for each risk factor.The register contained 47.9% women and 52.1% men. Men had more often diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction, intermittent arterial claudication, and over the limit alcohol consumption. Women had more often hypertension and obesity. Atrial fibrillation and smoking were equally frequent in both genders.

The aim of this investigation was to compare long-term functional outcomes between male and female after acute stroke.Patients with acute stroke were enrolled prospectively between January 2005 and January 2009. Baseline characteristics, risk factors, stroke subtypes, time delay from onset to arrival at a hospital, active treatment, and stroke severity were compared between male and female. Differences in mortality and disability at discharge, and at 3 months and 1 year after stroke onset were also investigated. Functional disabilities were categorized into two groups: good outcome (score on modified Rankin scale â‰_2) and poor outcome (score on modified Rankin scale >2).Among 1,055 patients with acute stroke, 575 were male (aged 64.83Â±11.98 years, meanÂ±SD) and 480 were female (aged 70.09Â±13.02 years).

All registered patients had undergone evaluation including stroke severity (as measured by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale [SSS], using a total score of 0-58, in which lower scores indicate more severe strokes), computed tomography, and cardiovascular risk factors. Patients were followed from admission until death or censoring. Case fatality (stratified by 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year) in men and women was correlated with age and stroke severity. Adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors was performed by means of multivariate regression analysis.A total of 20,854 (51.9%) men and 19,301 (48.1%) women were registered. Women were significantly older than men at the time of stroke (74.5 vs 69.7 years, respectively; P < 0.001) and had signficantly more severe strokes, as expressed by the mean SSS score (39.6 vs 43.3; P < 0.001).

The observed female survival advantage increased with age. The female survival advantage was seen in patients with severe as well as mild strokes, but not in those younger than age 50 years.Our findings dispute the effects of female sex hormones as the underlying cause of female survival superiority over men.

We hypothesize that MRI carotid plaque features will demonstrate sex differences indicative of higher-risk plaque in men.One hundred thirty-one patients (men, 67; women, 64) with >or=50% asymptomatic carotid stenosis on duplex ultrasound were included. Two blinded reviewers interpreted multicontrast MRI. Presence of a thin/ruptured fibrous cap, plaque components (lipid-rich/necrotic core, hemorrhage, and calcification), and percent component volume were documented. The associations between sex and individual plaque characteristics were examined using logistic and linear regression models (2-part models) controlling for demographic characteristics and MR angiographic findings.Presence of a thin/ruptured fibrous cap (48% versus 17%, adjusted OR=4.41, P<0.01) and lipid-rich/necrotic core (73% versus 50%, adjusted OR=3.66, P=0.01) were more common in men.

All cases with admission between 2003 and 2005 and a final diagnosis of ischaemic stroke (ICD10:I63) were selected. For various upper age limits (70, 75, 80, 85 and 90 years), we calculated the proportion of men and women excluded based on their age when applying the respective age span to the study population.A total of 34,754 patients were analyzed, and 17,748 (51%) hereof were women.

In particular, selecting 80 years as the upper age cut-off excluded 19% of all male patients but 44% of all female patients (p < 0.001).Setting an upper age limit for ischaemic stroke trials is likely not to be gender neutral but withholds a higher proportion of female than male patients from study participation.

Improving knowledge of the gender perspectives of older men and women regarding nursing care after stroke is crucial.This was a qualitative study based on interviews with five women and five men between 66 and 75 years of age, who had received nursing care at a ward for stroke rehabilitation. The data were collected in 2006. Qualitative content analysis of the interviews was carried out.A main theme and five categories, all common to both men and women, were identified. The main theme, to promote recovery of the body, encompassed the categories. There were, however, gender differences in how the nursing care received was experienced. The ways patients experienced nursing care seemed to be linked with their lives as women and men before they had the stroke. Their perceptions are linked with their lives as women and men before they had their stroke. Both men and women will reclaim former abilities but what they perceive to be the goals of nursing care and rehabilitation may differ.Nurses need to increase their awareness and knowledge concerning the similarities and gender differences in the experiences and needs of older people, both men and women."

It is grossly underdiagnosed and untreated.The authors studied sex differences in the prevalence of post-stroke depression (PSD), which have not been adequately studied, and may have important implications for clinicians.The authors performed a systematic review of five databases of all observational studies that stratified data by sex, measuring the prevalence of PSD.Fifty-six publications, including 47 primary studies between 1982 and 2006, met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. A total of 75,131 subjects comprised these studies, with 11,910 women and 62,899 men.The prevalence of depression among women was higher in 35 studies. Moreover, the prevalence was generally higher among inpatient populations (both in acute-care and rehabilitation facilities) than in community-dwelling subjects.PSD is highly prevalent in both sexes, but appears to be slightly more common among women than men. Untreated depression after stroke can lead to a reduced quality of life, poorer prognosis, and increased mortality. All stroke patients should be routinely screened for depression, and further research is needed to determine whether there are sex-specific differences in response to treatment."

A Serbian experience with thrombolysis in ischemic stroke (SETIS) study.,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2009 Nov,Outcomes,Human,156,"The female sex is associated with increased stroke severity and relatively poor functional recovery. Several studies have demonstrated that women with stroke benefit more from intravenous thrombolysis compared with men, while others found the nullification of gender effect among women treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). The purpose of our study was to determine any gender differences in the efficacy and safety of systemic thrombolysis among patients with acute ischemic stroke in Serbia.Data were from the Serbian experience with intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke (SETIS) study, a prospective, ongoing, multicenter, open, and observational study in Serbia of all patients who have received rtPA for acute ischemic stroke. We analyzed sex differences in the baseline characteristics, functional outcome and treatment complications.Among 60 women and 96 men with stroke and treated with intravenous thrombolysis, we found that at day 90, no significant sex differences in excellent functional outcome (50.9% of women vs. 57.0% of men, p=0.5), favorable functional outcome (61.4% of women vs. 68.8% of men, p=0.38) or death (8.8% of women vs. 12.9% of men, p=0.60). These results were constant even after adjustments for age, severity of basal neurological deficit and onset to treatment time.There were no sex differences in functional outcome at 90 days after the stroke among patients treated with IV rtPA. This finding might confirm that thrombolytic therapy nullifies usual sex differences in stroke outcome and suggests that women with stroke may benefit more from rtPA treatment."
19265047,No," Fudong Liu,",Sex differences in caspase activation after stroke.,"Stroke, a journal of cerebral circulation",2009 May,Pathophysiology,Mouse,na,"Over the past 5 years, experimental data have emerged that ischemia-induced cell death pathways may differ in males and females. Cell death in males is triggered by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor. We have previously shown that interference with this pathway benefits males but not females after an experimental stroke. In contrast, caspase activation may be the major pathway activated after ischemic injury in females. The aim of this study is to examine whether sex differences exist in caspase activation in adult mice after stroke and to determine if interference with stroke-induced caspase activation preferentially protects females.Focal stroke was induced by reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (90 minutes) in young and aging C57BL/6 mice of both sexes. The pan-caspase inhibitor, quinoline-Val-Asp(Ome)-CH2-O-phenoxy was administered at reperfusion. Histological outcomes were assessed 48 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Separate cohorts were used for protein analysis of key cell death proteins, including caspase-3, caspase-8, cytochrome C, and apoptosis-inducing factor.Drug-treated female mice had significantly decreased infarct volumes and improved neurological deficits after stroke compared to vehicle-treated mice. Quinoline-Val-Asp(Ome)-CH2-O-phenoxy administration had no effect in male mice. The expression of cytochrome C and nuclear caspase-8 levels were increased in females after stroke.Female mice had an early release of cytochrome C and enhanced caspase activation after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Caspase inhibition benefited females but not males. Sex differences exist in both the response to ischemic injury and the efficacy of neuroprotective agents."

We undertook a meta-analysis to determine whether a sex disparity existed.We identified studies that reported sex-specific IV rt-PA treatment rates for acute stroke. Eligible studies included acute stroke admissions from single or multiple hospitals, registries, or administrative databases. Random effects odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated to quantify sex differences (females versus males) among all ischemic stroke admissions and among the eligible subgroup who arrived within 3 hours without contraindications. Study design and geographic location were explored as sources of heterogeneity.Eighteen studies were included. Study designs included single hospitals (n=5), multiple hospitals (n=6), registries (n=4), and administrative databases (n=3). The summary OR was 0.70 (95% CI=0.55 to 0.88) indicating that women had a 30% lower odds of receiving rt-PA treatment than men. However, substantial between-study variability existed. Among 13 hospital-based studies, the summary OR was 0.78 (95% CI=0.71 to 0.86) with no significant heterogeneity. Among the 3 administrative studies, the OR was 0.55 (95% CI=0.34 to 0.90) but with significant heterogeneity. Among 4 studies that included data on the eligible subgroup, women had a nonsignificant lower odds of treatment (OR=0.81, 95% CI=0.58 to 1.13).Despite the presence of significant between-study variation, women with acute stroke were consistently less likely to receive thrombolysis treatment compared with men. Further studies to explore the origins of this sex disparity are warranted."
19268668,No," Mike Yuan,",Sex differences in the response to activation of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase pathway after experimental stroke.,Experimental neurology,2009 May,Pathophysiology,Mouse,na,"It is increasingly recognized that histological and functional outcomes after stroke are shaped by biologic sex. Emerging data suggests that ischemic cell death pathways are sexually dimorphic (Hurn, P., Vannucci, S., Hagberg, H. (2005) Adult or perinatal brain injury: does sex matter?. Stroke 36, 193-195 ; Lang, J.T., McCullough, L.D. (2008) Pathways to ischemic neuronal cell death: are sex differences relevant?. J. Transl. Med. 6). Reducing neuronal nitric oxide (NO) or poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP1) activation protects only the male brain (Hagberg, H., et al. PARP-1 gene disruption in mice preferentially protects males from perinatal brain injury. J. Neurochem. 90, 1068-1075 (2004)), and paradoxically enhances ischemic injury in females (McCullough, L.D., et al. Ischemic nitric oxide and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 in cerebral ischemia: male toxicity, female protection. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 25, 502-512 (2005)). In this study, we examined downstream mediators of NO/PARP activation to investigate possible mediators of ischemic sexual dimorphism. Nuclear translocation of Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) was equivalent in wild type males and females after stroke and was unaffected by estrogen exposure. Deletion of PARP1 led to a dramatic reduction in stroke-induced poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PAR) formation and AIF translocation in both sexes, yet ischemic damage was reduced only in males. Subsequent examination of AIF-deficient Harlequin mice demonstrated that male Harlequin mice had less PAR formation, reduced AIF translocation and less ischemic damage than male wild type mice. In contrast, female Harlequin mice had no neuroprotective effect of gene deletion despite robust reductions in PAR formation and AIF translocation. Although equivalent activation of this cell death pathway occurs in both sexes after ischemia, detrimental effects are only present in males. AIF translocation and PAR formation do not mediate ischemic injury in the female brain, therefore agents designed to reduce PARP1 activation are unlikely to benefit females."

We aimed to explore the impact of gender on incidence and relative risks of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke among the diabetic population in Taiwan.In this study, 500,868 diabetic patients and 500,248 age matched and-sex-matched nondiabetic individuals were linked to inpatient claims (1997-2002) to identify hospitalizations for nontraumatic hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Incidence density was calculated with the Poisson assumption, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the cumulative incidence over a 6-year follow-up period. We also evaluated the relative hazards of stroke in relation to diabetes with the Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted with demographics and geographic regions.The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in diabetic women was less than that in diabetic men except in those aged > or =85, but the difference between male and female diabetic patients was less pronounced with ischemic stroke. The hazard ratios (HRs) of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke among diabetic women were increased by a magnitude of 1.2 and 1.32, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of diabetic men. Further age-stratified analysis indicated that young and middle-aged diabetic women tended to have higher HRs and that diabetic women aged <35 suffered from particularly high HRs (HR 7.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.81-32.75 for hemorrhagic stroke, and HR = 8.46, 95% CI 4.28-16.75 for ischemic stroke).There was a significant gender-diabetes interactive effect on the incidence of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Additionally, young Taiwanese diabetic patients were most vulnerable to an increased relative risk of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Comprehensive diabetic care with stroke prevention measures should be emphasized in young diabetic people in order to prevent premature disability."

We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between service use and age, sex, race, and Stroke Belt state residence, controlling for other socio-demographic and health care access characteristics.Among 11 862 adults with a history of stroke, 16% were 80 or older, 54% were women, 13% were non-Hispanic black, and 23% lived within a Stroke Belt state. Overall service use varied: 31% reported poststroke outpatient rehabilitation, 57% regular exercise, 66% smoking cessation counseling, and 91% current use of antihypertensive medications. Age 80 or older was not associated with lower use of any of the 11 services. Women were less likely to report poststroke outpatient rehabilitation and regular exercise when compared with men (probability values <or=0.005); there were no sex-based differences in use of the 9 other services. Blacks were less likely to report pneumococcal vaccination when compared with whites, but were more likely to report poststroke outpatient rehabilitation (probability values <or=0.005); there were no race-based differences in use of the 9 other services. Stroke Belt state residence was not associated with lower use of any of the 11 services.Use of many stroke secondary prevention services was suboptimal.

Available data show that AF patients are widely heterogeneous in terms of ischaemic stroke risk. The role of female gender as a predictor of stroke risk is inconsistent, in particular it is unclear if warfarin treatment is able to prevent stroke equally in both sexes. We performed a prospective study on 780 AF patients on OAT, followed by an Anticoagulation Clinic, to evaluate if female gender is a risk factor for stroke among patients on OAT and if the quality of anticoagulation is different between genders. No difference was found in relation to the quality of anticoagulation between genders (p=0.5). During follow-up 33 patients had major bleedings (rate 1.37 x 100 pt/yrs) but no difference was found between genders in bleeding risk. Forty patients had ischaemic events [rate 1.66 x 100 pt/yrs; males rate 1.2 x 100 pt/yrs; females rate 2.43 x 100 pt/yrs; p=0.042; relative risk (RR) of females vs. males 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-3.1); p= 0.004]. The higher rate of ischaemic events in females with respect to males was confirmed at Cox regression analysis after correction for age (p=0.009). In addition, strokes occurring in females were more disabling, and RR for severe and fatal stroke, defined according to Modified Rankin scale, of females vs. males was 3.1 (95% CI 1.3-6.5; p=0.001). In conclusion, our data show a higher risk of stroke in anticoagulated AF females with respect to males, despite a similar quality of anticoagulation."

Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of increased risk of stroke. Use of exogenous estrogen, especially in vulnerable populations, increases stroke risk. Women and men have different responses to primary and secondary stroke prevention. Women may not be offered acute ischemic stroke treatment as frequently as men; and female stroke survivors have worse outcomes.Gender-related differences in stroke are attributed to the hormonal changes that women experience through their lifetime, diverse risk factors for stroke in men and women, and specific lifestyles, and comorbid conditions.

Statin pretreatment might affect this association. Sex differences in the prognostic value of the lipid profile have not yet been studied. We have evaluated the impact of TC, high- and low-density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL, respectively), and triglyceride (TG) levels on the 3-month outcome after a first ischemic stroke (IS) according to sex and previous statin use. The study group consisted of a hospital-based cohort of consecutive patients with a diagnosis of first IS. Poor outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score >or=3 at 90 days. The odds ration (OR) for poor prognosis was analyzed for each sex using logistic regression models adjusted for vascular risk factors and statin pretreatment. A total of 591 patients were included in the analysis (318 men). The predictors of a 90-day poor outcome were age and initial NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score in women, and age, initial NIHSS, smoking, atrial fibrillation, and thrombolytic treatment in men. In women, none of the lipids studied affected the 90-day prognosis. Men falling in the last quintile of TC [OR: 0.68 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.52-0.88; p = 0.004] and LDL (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.98; p = 0.04) have better outcome than men in the first quintile. Adjusting for statin pretreatment did not change the results. The results indicated that an association between poststroke lipids and prognosis may vary by sex. In women, lipids were not associated with the outcome; in men, lower TC and LDL were associated with worse prognosis. These differences can not be explained by statin use and require further research."

Men were younger but had higher rates of cardiac comorbidities than women. Women had lower unadjusted rates of stroke, coronary artery disease, and mortality at 30 days and 1 year after TIA admission.

Causes of these disparities are unclear but could result from a different symptom presentation in women. Our objective was to prospectively investigate gender differences in acute stroke symptoms.Ischemic stroke/TIA cases presenting to the University of Michigan Hospital (January 2005 to December 2007) were identified. Stroke/TIA symptoms, ascertained by patient interview, were classified as traditional or nontraditional (pain, mental status change, lightheadedness, headache, other neurological, nonneurological). Prevalence of any nontraditional symptom and of each symptom were calculated by gender. Logistic regression was used to compare nontraditional symptoms by gender adjusted for stroke vs TIA, proxy use, age, and discharge disposition (home vs other).Included were 461 cases (48.6% women; median age, 67). Among women, 51.8% reported >or=1 nontraditional stroke/TIA symptom compared to 43.9% of men (P=0.09). The most prevalent nontraditional symptom was mental status change (women, 23.2%; men, 15.2%; P=0.03). The odds of reporting at least 1 nontraditional stroke/TIA symptom were 1.42 times (95% CI, 0.97-2.06) greater in women than in men.A high prevalence of nontraditional symptoms among both genders was found, with women more likely to report nontraditional symptoms and, in particular, altered mental status, compared with men.

MetS increases the risk of stroke in women to a greater extent than in men. We aimed to investigate whether there might be sex differences in the impact of MetS on the response to intravenous thrombolysis for acute MCA ischemic stroke.We prospectively studied consecutive ischemic stroke patients, treated with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator according to SITS-MOST criteria, with an MCA occlusion on prebolus transcranial Doppler examination. Resistance to thrombolysis was defined as the absence of complete MCA recanalization 24 hours after tissue-type plasminogen activator infusion by transcranial Doppler criteria. MetS was diagnosed according to the criteria established by the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 2005 statement.A total of 125 patients (75 men, 50 women; mean age, 67.6+/-11 years) were included. MetS was diagnosed in 76 (61%) patients. Resistance to clot lysis at 24 hours was observed in 53 (42%) patients. Two multivariate-adjusted, logistic-regression models identified that MetS was associated with a higher resistance to tissue-type plasminogen activator, independently of other significant baseline variables (odds ratio=9.8; 95% CI, 3.5 to 27.8; P=0.0001) and of the individual components of the MetS. The MetS was associated with a significantly higher odds of resistance to thrombolysis in women (odds ratio=17.5; 95% CI, 1.9 to 163.1) than in men (odds ratio=5.1; 95% CI, 1.6 to 15.6; P for interaction=0.0004).The effect of MetS on the resistance to intravenous thrombolysis for acute MCA ischemic stroke appears to be more pronounced in women than in men."

We compared rates of carotid imaging, the severity of carotid stenosis, and rates of carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty within 6 months of the index event in women vs men.We studied 6,389 patients (48% women) with ischemic stroke or TIA. Women were less likely than men to undergo carotid imaging (81% vs 86%, p < 0.0001); however, when the analysis was limited to patients without apparent contraindications to surgery, 92% received carotid imaging, with no difference between women and men. Women were less likely than men to have severe carotid stenosis (7.4% vs 11.5%, p < 0.0001). Women were half as likely as men to undergo carotid revascularization within 6 months of the index event (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 0.70), but this gender difference was no longer significant in the subgroup with severe carotid stenosis (odds ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 1.15).Although women with ischemic stroke or TIA are less likely than men to undergo carotid screening and revascularization, this difference is largely explained by potential contraindications to surgery and by sex differences in the severity of carotid disease."

However, the contribution of androgens to stroke outcome remains unclear. We compared outcomes from middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in castrated mice with those in testosterone- or dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-replaced castrated mice. Castrates treated with 1.5 mg testosterone or 0.5 mg DHT before MCAO showed smaller infarct volumes (hemisphere: 27 or 26%) at 24 h after 90 mins MCAO than did untreated castrates (37%), whereas 5 mg testosterone or 1.5 mg DHT exacerbated infarcts (53 or 51%). These outcomes were blocked by the androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide, suggesting that androgen receptors mediate these responses to ischemia. We further evaluated long-term outcomes with a milder 60-min MCAO in castrates treated with the protective 1.5 mg testosterone dose. Consistent with data obtained at 24 h reperfusion, the infarct volume was decreased at 9 days reperfusion. Neurobehavioral analysis showed that motor functional recovery was improved during the first 3 days of reperfusion, but not improved at 7 days. We conclude that testosterone exhibits dose-dependent and time-sensitive effects after ischemia and that testosterone is likely to be an important factor in sex-linked differences in cerebrovascular disease."

However, no clinical trials examining hormone replacement therapy on outcome following ischemic stroke have investigated the effect of progesterone-only treatment. In this review the authors examine the experimental evidence for the neuroprotective potential of progesterone and give an insight into potential mechanisms of action following ischemic stroke. To date, 17 experimental studies have investigated the neuroprotective potential of progesterone for ischemic stroke in terms of ability to both reduce cell loss and increase functional outcome. Of these 17 published studies the majority reported a beneficial effect with three studies reporting a nil effect and only one study reporting a negative effect. However, there are important issues that the authors address in this review in terms of the methodological quality of studies in relation to the STAIR recommendations. In terms of the proposed mechanisms of progesterone neuroprotection we show that progesterone is versatile and acts at multiple targets to facilitate neuronal survival and minimize cell damage and loss. A large amount of experimental evidence indicates that progesterone is a neuroprotective candidate for ischemic stroke; however, to progress to clinical trial a number of key experimental studies remain outstanding."

The purpose of this article is to give a worldwide review on sex differences in stroke epidemiology.We searched PubMed, tables-of-contents, review articles, and reference lists for community-based studies including information on sex differences. In some areas, such as secular trends, ischemic subtypes and stroke severity, noncommunity-based studies were also reviewed. Male/female ratios were calculated.We found 98 articles that contained relevant sex-specific information, including 59 incidence studies from 19 countries and 5 continents. The mean age at first-ever stroke was 68.6 years among men, and 72.9 years among women. Male stroke incidence rate was 33% higher and stroke prevalence was 41% higher than the female, with large variations between age bands and between populations. The incidence rates of brain infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage were higher among men, whereas the rate of subarachnoidal hemorrhage was higher among women, although this difference was not statistically significant. Stroke tended to be more severe in women, with a 1-month case fatality of 24.7% compared with 19.7% for men.Worldwide, stroke is more common among men, but women are more severely ill.

We hypothesized that presenting symptom differences could explain these delays.Data were collected on 1922 acute stroke cases who presented to 15 hospitals participating in a statewide stroke registry. We evaluated 2 in-hospital time intervals: emergency department arrival to physician examination (""door-to-doctor"") and emergency department arrival to brain imaging (""door-to-image""). We used parametric survival models to estimate time ratios, which represent the ratio of average times comparing women to men, after adjusting for symptom presentation and other confounders.Women were significantly less likely than men to present with any stroke warning sign or suspected stroke (87.5% versus 91.4%) or to report trouble with walking, balance, or dizziness (9.5% versus 13.7%). Difficulty speaking and loss of consciousness were associated with shorter door-to-doctor times. Weakness, facial droop, difficulty speaking, and loss of consciousness were associated with shorter door-to-image times, whereas difficulty with walking/balance was associated with longer door-to-image times. In adjusted analyses, women had 11% longer door-to-doctor intervals (time ratio, 1.11; 95%, CI 1.02 to 1.22) and 15% longer door-to-image intervals (time ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.25) after accounting for presenting symptoms, age, and other confounders. Furthermore, these sex differences remained evident after restricting to patients who arrived within 6 or within 2 hours of symptom onset.Women with acute stroke experienced greater emergency department delays than men, which were not attributable to differences in presenting symptoms, time of arrival, age, or other confounders."

In this study, we show that minocycline is ineffective at reducing ischemic damage in females after middle cerebral artery occlusion, likely due to effects on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase signaling.

Age-specific rate ratios (RRs) for comparing women with men for both incidence and mortality were modeled with adjustment for study year and socioeconomic deprivation. Logistic regression was used to model 30-day case-fatality.Women had a lower incidence of first hospitalization than men and size of effect varied with age (55 to 64 years, RR=0.65, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.66; >or=85 years, RR=0.94, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.96).

Data on 30- and 90-day mortality were obtained from The Civil Registration System. We compared proportions of patients receiving adequate care between sexes, as measured by admission to a specialized stroke unit, administration of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, examination with CT/MRI scan, and assessment by a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, and of nutritional risk. Further, we computed 30- and 90-day mortality rate ratios (MRR), adjusted for patient characteristics, fulfillment of quality of care criteria, and department.The proportion of patients who received adequate care was either slightly lower or similar among women when compared to men. The relative risks (RR) of receiving specific components of care ranged from 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI]:0.74 to 0.96) to 1.01 (95% CI:0.96 to 1.06) when comparing sexes. The adjusted mortality rate ratios were lower among women and adjustment for fulfillment of quality of care criteria had only marginal impact.There appear not to be any substantial sex-related differences in acute hospital care among patients with stroke in Denmark. The lower female short-term mortality is therefore most likely explained by other factors."

QOC was measured using 7 predefined performance measures and a defect-free care summary measure (defined as the proportion of patients who received all eligible interventions).Compared to men, women were older and more likely to present by ambulance. They were also more likely to have a past medical history of atrial fibrillation or hypertension, and less likely to have a history of heart disease, dyslipidemia, or smoking. Although sex differences in individual performance measures were relatively modest they consistently identified women as being less likely to receive care compared to men. Overall, women received less defect-free care than men (66.3% versus 71.1%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 0.87) and were less likely to be discharged home (41.0% versus 49.5%, aOR=0.84, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.85). Although crude mortality was higher in women (6.0% versus 5.2%), this difference was eliminated after risk adjustment (aOR=1.03, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.06).Quality of care for women with ischemic stroke was lower than that for men, and women were less likely to be discharged home.

Age is the most important nonmodifiable risk factor for stroke, yet many preclinical models continue to examine only young male animals. It remains unclear how experimental stroke outcomes change with aging and with biologic sex. If sex differences are present, it is not known whether these reflect an intrinsic differing sensitivity to stroke or are secondary to the loss of estrogen with aging. We subjected both young and aging mice of both sexes to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Young female mice had smaller strokes compared with age-matched males, an effect that was reversed by ovariectomy. Stroke damage increased with aging in female mice, whereas male mice had decreased damage after MCAO. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability changes are correlated with infarct size. However, aging mice had significantly less edema formation, an effect that was independent of sex and histologic damage. Differences in the cellular response to stroke occur across the life span in both male and female mice. These differences need to be considered when developing relevant therapies for stroke patients, the majority of whom are elderly."

We analyze demographics, risk factors, lifestyles, treatments, and responses to treatment.Of 126 data elements examined, statistically significant gender differences were noted for 47 (37%). As compared to men, women in Colorado were older and more significantly impacted by acute stroke. Risk factor profiles differed between the 2 genders, with men having a higher incidence of coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, carotid stenosis and tobacco smoking, while women had a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Lipids were less aggressively treated and antithrombotics were less commonly used in women.

Patient demographics, clinical variables, and stroke symptoms were abstracted from medical records by trained abstractors using standardized forms. Estimates were age-standardized to the age distribution of men and women combined. Presenting symptoms occurred within 24 hours of incident stroke admission; prodromal symptoms occurred >or=24 hours of admission.Women were significantly older (P<0.001), more likely to have cardioembolic stroke (P<0.01), and less likely to receive aspirin (P=0.014) or statins (P<0.001).

Without treatment with thrombolysis, female stroke patients have a poorer clinical outcome compared to their male counterparts. Although some studies show that women have better clinical outcomes than men following intravenous thrombolysis, no gender difference is seen in others. Post-hoc analyses of relatively small studies show higher recanalisation rates in women than men following intravenous thrombolysis, and no gender difference in recanalisation rates following intra-arterial thrombolysis.

The information of educational level (junior high school graduates, senior high school graduates, college and/or higher education) and physical functional limitations (no need for assistance, need for assistance when going outdoors, and need for assistance to carry out indoor activities) were obtained by self-administrated questionnaire.The proportions of the subjects reported their highest level of schooling were 48% for junior high school, 39% for high school, and 13% for college. Three hundred and twenty eight subjects (1% of total subjects) reported having some physical functional limitations. Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that the odds ratio of needing assistance to carry out indoor activities were 4.84(95%CI:3.61,6.50) for lowest education level group and 2.21(95%CI:1.00,4.86) for middle education level group compared to highest education level group. The corresponding odds ratios of needing assistance when going outdoors were 2.36(95%CI: 2.03,2.72) and 1.08(95%CI:0.73,1.60), respectively. Further, the significant excess prevalence of having functional limitations associated with the low education level was identified for men regardless of history of stroke and for women without history of stroke.Low education level was associated with the higher prevalence of physical functional limitations for both genders. That association among persons with history of stroke was observed for men but not for women probably due to gender differences in stroke subtypes and social support."

We investigated whether gender was associated with all-cause mortality after hospital admission for stroke.A nationwide cohort of patients with a first admission for stroke and stroke subtypes was identified through linkage of national registers. Age- and gender-specific mortality risks were quantified for 28-day case-fatality, 1-year and 5-year periods. Cox regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding factors.We identified 30,675 stroke patients (15,925 women, 14,750 men).

In subarachnoid hemorrhage patients, no differences between men and women in crude and adjusted mortality risks were observed. When all stroke types were combined, differences in mortality risk between men and women were seen, and appeared to differ by age (increased risk in young women, lower risk in older women).Women have lower 28-day case-fatality and long-term mortality risks after an ischemic stroke and lower 1-year and 5-year mortality risks after an intracerebral hemorrhage compared to men, whereas no differences in mortality risks were found for subarachnoid hemorrhage."

Many patients (70% men, 77% women) reported that they had received insufficient information about physical exertion. Significant associations were found between deteriorated physical function and deteriorated cognitive function as well as fear of physical exertion.Deterioration was found in physical and cognitive functions greater in women then in men. Insecurity regarding physical exertion existed indicating that younger stroke patients might need information directly aimed at physical functioning and more gender specific than today.

All patients admitted to Al-watani governmental hospital in Palestine from September 2006 to August 2007 and diagnosed with acute stroke were included in the study. Diagnosis of stroke was confirmed by computerized tomography scan. Demographics and clinical data pertaining to the patients were obtained from their medical files. The main outcome measure in this study was vital status at hospital discharge. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 15. A total of 186 acute stroke cases (95 females and 91 males) were included in the study. Hypertension (69.9%) and diabetes mellitus (45.2%) were the most common risk factors among the patients. Thirty nine (21%) of the stroke patients died in hospital. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that chronic kidney disease (P = 0.004), number of post-stroke complications (P = 0.037), and stroke subtype (P = 0.015) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality among the total stroke patients. Knowledge of in-hospital mortality predictors is required to improve survival rate after acute stroke. The study showed that gender was not an independent predictor of mortality after acute stroke. More research is required to understand gender differences in stroke mortality."

This nullification of the usual gender effect among rtPA-treated patients has not been confirmed.We analyzed baseline characteristics and functional outcomes in men vs women in the Canadian Alteplase for Stroke Effectiveness Study (CASES), a multicenter study that collected outcomes data for patients treated with rtPA in Canada to assess the safety and effectiveness of alteplase for stroke in the context of routine care.Among 1,110 patients, including 615 men and 505 women, a normal or near normal outcome at 90 days was found in 37.1% of men vs 36.0% of women (p = 0.71). This was essentially unchanged after adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, including age >70, glucose, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Severity, and baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (35.2% in men vs 38.2% in women, p = 0.332). Ninety-day mortality was similar between the sexes in both the adjusted and unadjusted analysis.There was no difference in 90-day outcomes in recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)-treated men and rtPA-treated women. This is consistent with the pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials, showing greater benefit for thrombolysis in women and nullification of the usual gender difference in outcome."

All patients underwent a complete stroke workup including clinical examination, standard blood tests, cerebral and vascular imaging, transesophageal echocardiography, and 24-hour electrocardiography. In 500 patients, no definite etiology could be established (cryptogenic stroke/TIA). Of them, 167 patients (107 men and 60 women, mean age 52 +/- 13 years) had an PFO.The prevalence of PFO in patients with cryptogenic stroke or TIA was higher in men than in women (38% vs 28%, P = .014). Stroke severity and the prevalence of risk factors did not differ between the 2 sexes. There was an independent association between male sex and stroke location in the posterior cerebral circulation (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4-6.5, P = .006). Men and women did not differ in respect to PFO grade, prevalence of right-to-left shunt at rest, or coexistence of atrial septal aneurysm. Clinical outcome at 3 months was similar in both sexes.Patent foramen ovale was more prevalent in men than in women with cryptogenic stroke. There were no sex influences on age, risk factors, echocardiographic characteristics of PFO, or clinical outcome.

These risk factors lead to an increase in arterial stiffness. Measuring this stiffness at an early age may identify candidates for primary preventative intervention strategies by nurses.Caucasian Canadians (n = 176) were recruited. Peripheral and central blood pressure, pulse pressure, augmentation pressure, arterial compliance (augmentation index and pulse wave velocity) and sub-endocardial viability ratio (SEVR), were assessed using applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor system). Blood was drawn for fasting lipid and glucose profiling.Women participants had significantly stiffer arteries than men (augmentation index: 28 SEM = 1% vs. 18 SEM = 2% respectively; p < 0.001). Pulse wave velocity, however, was not different (7.7 SEM = 0.2 m/s vs. 8.3 SEM = 0.1 m/s respectively; p < 0.001). Age was a strong predictor of arterial stiffening in both genders, but the effect was greater in women.Women having stiffer arteries than men, thus at greater cardiovascular risk, may require earlier screening. The effect might be postmenopausal, and mechanisms require further investigation. However, both middle-aged men and women considering themselves 'healthy' may benefit from more proactive primary prevention.Applanation tonometry, used extensively by nurses, provides early detection of central haemodynamic changes and vascular compliance at all ages. Knowledge of arterial stiffness could guide the management of primary prevention in the nursing cardiovascular risk reduction clinic."

Age-specific stroke rates are higher in men, but, because of their longer life expectancy and much higher incidence at older ages, women have more stroke events than men. With the exception of subarachnoid haemorrhage, there is little evidence of sex differences in stroke subtype or severity. Although several reports found that women are less likely to receive some in-hospital interventions, most differences disappear after age and comorbidities are accounted for. However, sex disparities persist in the use of thrombolytic treatment (with alteplase) and lipid testing. Functional outcomes and quality of life after stroke are consistently poorer in women, despite adjustment for baseline differences in age, prestroke function, and comorbidities. Here, we comprehensively review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, medical care, and outcomes of stroke in women."

Sexual differences in stroke have been recognized, though the mechanisms remain unclear. Women have a unique risk factor profile, especially so in the reproductively active age group. Exposure to oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy and a higher incidence of migraine and vasculitic disorders in women suggest that stroke would be common in women. Yet, the incidence of stroke remains higher in men across all ages, indicating a protective role of sex hormones. The differences in incidence and prevalence of stroke decreases as women age, confirming that hormones play a pivotal role in terms of normal physiology, disease and recovery. Recent evidence also points to sex based differences in response to therapy, in terms of acute management and prevention. Gender based differences in accessibility and provision of health care facilities add to the observed differences in terms of stroke outcome, though here women seem to fare worse than men. This review summarizes the observed sex differences in stroke, possible hormonal mechanisms that may explain the same and outlines recent patents and scope for future research in this field."

The increase in GFAP signals was significantly higher in female mice in the metestrus/diestrus period compared with male transgenic mice (1.71 x 10(7)+/-0.19 x 10(7) vs 0.92 x 10(7)+/-0.15 x 10(7), P<0.001). Similar results were obtained by quantitative immunohistochemistry (males vs females: 13.4+/-0.5 vs 16.96+/-0.64, P<0.0001). However, astrocyte activation/GFAP signals showed cyclic, estrus-dependent variations in response to ischemic injury. Physiologically higher levels of estrogen and application of pharmacologic doses of estrogen during replacement therapy attenuated GFAP upregulation after stroke. Interestingly, contrary to a positive correlation between the intensities of GFAP signals and infarct size in male mice, no such correlation was observed in any of the experimental groups of female GFAP-luc mice.Our results suggest that GFAP upregulation in ischemic injury may have different functional significance in female and male experimental animals and may not directly reflect the extent of ischemia-induced neuronal damage in female GFAP-luc mice. Using a novel live imaging approach, we demonstrated that the early-phase brain inflammatory response to ischemia may be associated with sex-specific biomarkers of brain damage."

We previously found that 17beta-estradiol profoundly affects mitochondrial function in cerebral blood vessels, enhancing efficiency of energy production and suppressing mitochondrial oxidative stress. To determine whether estrogen specifically affects endothelial mitochondria through receptor mechanisms, we used cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). 17beta-Estradiol treatment for 24 h increased mitochondrial cytochrome c protein and mRNA; use of silencing RNA for estrogen receptors (ERs) showed that this effect involved ERalpha, but not ERbeta. Mitochondrial ROS were determined by measuring the activity of aconitase, an enzyme with an iron-sulfur center inactivated by mitochondrial superoxide. 17beta-Estradiol increased mitochondrial aconitase activity in HBMECs, indicating a reduction in ROS. Direct measurement of mitochondrial superoxide with MitoSOX Red showed that 17beta-estradiol, but not 17alpha-estradiol, significantly decreased mitochondrial superoxide production, an effect blocked by the ER antagonist, ICI-182,780 (fulvestrant). Selective ER agonists demonstrated that the decrease in mitochondrial superoxide was mediated by ERalpha, not ERbeta. The selective estrogen receptor modulators, raloxifene and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, differentially affected mitochondrial superoxide production, with raloxifene acting as an agonist but 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen acting as an estrogen antagonist. Changes in superoxide by 17beta-estradiol could not be explained by changes in manganese superoxide dismutase. Instead, ERalpha-mediated decreases in mitochondrial ROS may depend on the concomitant increase in mitochondrial cytochrome c, previously shown to act as an antioxidant. Mitochondrial protective effects of estrogen in cerebral endothelium may contribute to sex differences in the occurrence of stroke and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases."

Management of this disease, however, is generally guided by evidence from trials conducted predominantly in men, with few studies focused on women alone. Our objective was to review the characteristics and management of atherothrombotic disease in women, with particular emphasis on the therapeutic role of antiplatelet agents.Landmark clinical trials and other studies pertaining to atherothrombosis in women (including risk factors, clinical outcomes, and treatment patterns) were obtained through Pubmed and Medline literature research and reviewed.Primary prevention studies indicate a clear benefit of antiplatelet therapy in the reduction of cardiovascular events and, in particular, the risk of stroke in women >or=65 years. In men, this benefit is attributable to a reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Combination therapies, including aspirin plus dipyridamole or clopidogrel, effectively reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events in women. However, the effects are not consistent between men and women across studies. Similarly, gender differences exist in the effect of intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors plus aspirin on the risk of death or cardiovascular events.The effects of antiplatelet therapy regimens differ between men and women. The mechanisms underlying these differences are still to be elucidated; this report highlights the need for more studies focused on women in order to optimize gender-specific therapy and, therefore, improve clinical outcomes in women with atherothrombosis."

Sex differences in stroke care and patient status at discharge (in-hospital mortality and modified Rankin Scale score) were assessed after adjusting for differences in demographics, clinical characteristics, and comorbidities by multivariable models. Modified Rankin Scale score data were analyzed by proportional-odds models.Women were older than men (70 vs 67 years) and were more likely to have congestive heart failure and hypertension. Men were more likely to smoke and have a history of heart disease and dyslipidemia. After multivariable adjustment, women were less likely to receive thrombolytic therapy (odds ratio [OR]=0.56; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.86) or lipid testing (OR=0.76; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.94) and were more likely to suffer urinary tract infections (OR=2.57; 95% CI, 1.87 to 3.54). In-hospital mortality was similar in women and men (9% vs 8%); however, women had poorer discharge modified Rankin Scale scores (OR=1.17; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.35).Although considerable parity exists in many aspects of acute stroke care, women were less likely than men to receive thrombolytic treatment and lipid testing, even after adjustment.

18199994,Yes, Cheryl D Bushnell,Stroke and the female brain.,Nature clinical practice. Neurology,2008 Jan,Review,Human,na,"Stroke is a major public health problem. The female population carries a higher stroke burden than the male population, both because females have a longer life expectancy and because most stroke deaths occur in women. Differences between the sexes in relation to stroke are increasingly being recognized; for example, among stroke survivors, women tend to have worse outcomes than men, as indicated by more-severe disability and an increased likelihood of institutionalization in women. Women and men with stroke also differ in their risk factor profiles, and they respond differently to primary-prevention and acute stroke treatment. Women experience variations in endogenous estrogens throughout their life cycle and might also be exposed to exogenous estrogens, both of which markedly affect the brain. An understanding of the effects of endogenous and exogenous estrogens on cerebral hemodynamics could guide research into explaining how hormone therapy increases the risk of stroke in postmenopausal women. This Review summarizes the sex differences related to stroke, and the effect of endogenous and exogenous hormones on the cerebrovasculature of the female brain. It also proposes potential research approaches, the results of which could fill in gaps in our knowledge regarding the mechanism of action of estrogen in the brain."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of and mortality from stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the Swedish Sami population between 1985 and 2002, and to analyse the potential impact of income and level of education on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.A Sami cohort of 15,914 persons (4,465 reindeer herding and 11,449 non-herding Sami) were followed up from 1985 to 2002 with regard to incidence and mortality rates of AMI, stroke, and SAH. Incidence and mortality ratios were calculated using a demographically matched non-Sami control population (DMC) as the standard (71,550 persons).There was no elevated risk of developing AMI among the Sami compared with the DMC. However, the mortality ratio of AMI was significantly higher for Sami women. Higher incidence rates of stroke and SAH for both Sami men and women was observed, but no differences in mortality rates. Apart from the reindeer-herding men who demonstrated lower levels of income and education, the income and education levels among Sami were similar to the DMC.High mortality rates from AMI rather than stroke explain the excess mortality for CVD previously shown among Sami women. The results suggest that the differences in incidence of stroke between herding and non-herding Sami men, and between Sami women and non-Sami women, are caused by behavioural and psychosocial risk factors rather than by traditional socioeconomic ones."

Heart and circulatory physiology,2008 Jan,Pathophysiology,Mouse,na,"Women are less susceptible to the cerebrovascular complications of hypertension, such as a stroke and vascular dementia. The mechanism of such protection may be related to a reduced vulnerability of women to the cerebrovascular actions of hypertension. To test this hypothesis, we used a model of hypertension based on infusion of angiotensin II (ANG II), an octapeptide that plays a key role in hypertension and produces cerebrovascular dysregulation. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized (urethane-chloralose) C57BL/6J male and female mice equipped with a cranial window. ANG II administration (0.25 mug.kg(-1).min(-1) iv x 30-45 min) elevated arterial pressure equally in both sexes but attenuated the CBF increase induced by whisker stimulation or by the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh) in male but not in female mice. The administration of ANG II for 7 days (2.74 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), using osmotic minipumps, also attenuated these cerebrovascular responses in male, but not female, mice. The reduced susceptibility to the effect of ANG II in female mice was abolished by ovariectomy and reinstated by estrogen administration to ovariectomized mice. Administration of estrogen to male mice abolished the ANG II-induced attenuation of CBF responses. We conclude that female mice are less susceptible to the cerebrovascular dysregulation induced by ANG II, an effect related to estrogen. Such protection from the deleterious cerebrovascular effects of hypertension may play a role in the reduced vulnerability to the cerebrovascular complications of hypertension observed in women."

We used mice with targeted disruption of the gene encoding alpha-syntrophin (alpha-Syn(-/-)) that lack the perivascular AQP4 pool but retain the endothelial pool of this protein. Infarct volume at 72 h after transient focal ischemia (90 mins) in isoflurane-anesthetized mice was attenuated in both sexes with alpha-Syn deletion as compared with their wild-type (WT) counterparts. There were no sex differences in hemispheric water content in WT and alpha-Syn(-/-) mice or regional AQP4 expression in WT mice. In neither sex did alpha-Syn deletion lead to alterations in end-ischemic regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). These data suggest that after experimental stroke: (1) there is no difference in stroke-associated cerebral edema based on sex, (2) AQP4 does not involve in sex-based differences in stroke volume, and (3) perivascular pool of AQP4 has no significant role in end-ischemic rCBF."

However, limited information is available about the burden of stroke in individuals over 80. We sought to evaluate differences in clinical outcomes in Canadians over 80 years old hospitalized for an acute ischemic stroke.The authors conducted a multicenter cohort study including all hospital admissions for ischemic stroke identified from the Canadian Hospital Morbidity and Mortality Database from April 2003 to March 2004. The Hospital Morbidity and Mortality Database contains a national database that contains patient-level sociodemographic, diagnostic, procedural, and administrative information from across Canada. Multivariable analysis was performed using logistic regression. The primary outcome was 7-day case fatality and fatality at discharge. Secondary end points included intensive care unit admissions, medical complications, gender differences, length of hospital stay, and discharge disposition.We analyzed 26,676 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 606 hospitals across Canada. Mean age (SD) was 74+/-13 years. Overall, 10,171 (38%) were aged 80 years or older. Case fatality at discharge was 5.7% (age < 59), 8.6% (age 60 to 69), 13.4% (age 70 to 79), and 24.2% (age > or = 80; P<0.001). Patients aged 80 and over were less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (7.7% versus 15.3%; P<0.001) and discharged to their prestroke residence (47.2% for those over 80 versus 61.6% for patients younger than 80; P<0.001). Median length of stay was longer in those over 80 (10 days versus 7 days; P<0.0001). In the multivariable analysis for the older group, admission to the intensive care unit, low socioeconomic status, and admission to a nonacademic institution were associated with increased fatality after adjusting for covariates.Aging of the population is a growing reality in Western societies and this translates into an increasing demand on healthcare systems. In our study, patients with stroke over 80 had higher risk-adjusted fatality, longer hospitalization, and were less likely to be discharged to their original place of residence. Strategies need to be implemented to facilitate equal access to specialized stroke care for the elderly."

Compared with male stroke subjects, females had higher ADA1 activity and ADA1/ADA2 ratios. There were no significant differences between activities of ADA T and ADA2 in men and women of the stroke and control groups. In addition, the Canadian Neurological Scale in men was significantly higher than that of women in the stroke group (p<0.05).Our results suggest that the primary mechanism in men with ischemic stroke might involve the reduction of ADA1 activity. The reduction is probably an adaptation mechanism for induced increase in adenosine availability and protection of brain to ischemic injury."

Now, a new concept is emerging: the mechanisms and outcome of cerebral ischemic injury are influenced strongly by biological sex as well as the availability of sex steroids to the brain. The principal mammalian estrogen (17 beta estradiol or E2) is neuroprotective in many types of brain injury and has been the major focus of investigation over the past several decades. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that although hormones are a major contributor to sex-specific outcomes, they do not fully account for sex-specific responses to cerebral ischemia. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent studies in cell culture and animal models that suggest that genetic sex determines experimental stroke outcome and that divergent cell death pathways are activated after an ischemic insult. These sex differences need to be identified if we are to develop efficacious neuroprotective agents for use in stroke patients."

Of these patients, 213/300 (71.0%; eNOS 4a/b) and 223/310 (71.9%; iNOS R5/4) had died.Despite the fact that women were older than men (72.3 vs. 69.5 years, p = 0.001) at recruitment, poor long-term survival was not sex-related, but instead predicted by age (p < 0.0001), cardiac failure (p = 0.004), smoking (p = 0.017), diabetes (p = 0.049), and variation in the eNOS gene locus (p = 0.033). Smoking and variations in both eNOS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.53, p = 0.011] and iNOS loci (HR = 1.52, p = 0.073) were found to impact upon poor survival. We found a strong interaction between smoking, female sex, and the iNOS R5/4 genotype with the risk of death (HR = 3.23, CI = 1.51-6.90, p = 0.002). Compared with nonsmoking noncarriers, postmenopausal women who had been smokers and carried either the rare iNOS R5 allele (17.1%; HR = 4.23, CI = 1.84-9.75, p = 0.001) or the common eNOS 4b allele (71%; HR = 3.14, CI = 1.49-6.62, p = 0.003) were at a higher risk of death during the follow-up.

Information on background variables and treatment was collected during the hospital stay. After 3 months, the patients' living situation and outcome were assessed.Women were older than men when they had their stroke (mean age, 78.4 versus 73.6 years; P<0.001). On admission to the hospital, women were more often unconscious. Among conscious patients, there was no sex-related difference in the use of stroke unit care. Men and women had equal probability to receive thrombolysis and oral anticoagulants. Women were more likely to develop deep venous thromboses and fractures, whereas men were more likely to develop pneumonia during their hospital stay. Women had a lower 3-month survival, a difference that was associated with higher age and impaired level of consciousness on admission. Women were less often living at home at the 3-month follow-up. However, the difference in residency was not present in patients <85 years who were living at home without community support before the stroke.Reported sex differences in stroke care and outcome were mainly explained by the women's higher age and lower level of consciousness on admission."

17882669,Yes, R A Lobo,Menopause and stroke and the effects of hormonal therapy.,Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,2007 Oct,Review,Human,na,"The incidence of stroke increases substantially after menopause, and in the United States it is the third leading cause of death. Data exist suggesting that women have worse outcomes for stroke than do men. Trials of aspirin use further suggest that there is a gender difference regarding stroke. While men may have a coronary benefit from aspirin, postmenopausal women do not; yet ischemic stroke may be decreased in women but not in men. Among the traditional risk factors for stroke (such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity), hormonal therapy (HT) has been suggested to be a risk as well, although the data are not consistent. The previous Position Statement of the IMS published in 2004 was relatively silent on the issue of stroke. The annual rate of stroke in women increases rapidly with aging in postmenopausal women. While the rate is approximately 0.6-0.8/1000/year at age 50-59, it is over 2/1000 after age 60. In white women in the USA, it is 4.2/1000 at 65-74 years of age, and 11.3/1000 between ages 75 and 84 years. Thus, in trials such as the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), most of the strokes occurred in older women. Both the conjugated equine estrogen/medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE/MPA) and CEE-alone trials in the WHI reported an increased risk of stroke in the entire population using nominal statistics: 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.85) and 1.39 (95% CI 1.10-1.77), respectively. The increased risk was related to ischemic stroke and not hemorrhagic stroke. The absolute risk for the entire population was 0.8/1000 and 1.2/1000 woman-years (<1/1000 signifies a 'rare' event using the CIOMS classification). However, the risk was not increased in the 50-59-year-old age group, although the numbers are small. Here, the background prevalence of stroke is much lower as noted above. The results of the observational trial of the WHI were not consistent with the randomized clinical trial data and were more in keeping with older observational data showing no increased risk of stroke. The authors reconcile these differences by suggesting differences in the timing of initiation of hormones, which was at an earlier age in the observational cohort. Several recent observational studies, which will be presented, show no increased risk of ischemic stroke in younger cohorts, but possibly an increase in the risk of transient ischemic attack. These recent studies suggested the risk to be less with lower doses of estradiol < or =1 mg and to be consistent with older studies showing no risk with doses < 0.625 mg CEE. In addition, the risk was possibly lower with non-oral therapy, and was reduced if started prior to menopause. The existence of hypertension was shown to substantially increase the risk. However, data on progestogen use versus unopposed estrogen have not been consistent. At the same time, a recent body of evidence from basic science studies has reaffirmed the neuronal and stroke protective effects of estrogen. Thus, the discrepancy between these data and clinical data showing no benefit or increased risk of stroke remains to be explained. Recent trials in older women with osteoporosis have suggested an increased risk of stroke with tibolone and of stroke mortality with raloxifene. In conclusion, the current data suggest no increased risk of stroke with hormone therapy in younger (50-59 years) normotensive postmenopausal women, particularly when lower doses are prescribed soon after menopause."
17714091,Yes," Alyson A Miller, Christopher G Sobey",Effect of gender and sex hormones on vascular oxidative stress.,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,2007 Oct,Review,Human/Mouse,na,"1. It is well documented that the incidence and severity of several vascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis and stroke, are lower in premenopausal women than men of similar age and post-menopausal women. The mechanisms responsible for gender differences in the incidence and severity of vascular disease are not well understood. However, emerging evidence suggests that sex hormone-dependent differences in vascular oxidative stress may play an important role. The aim of the present brief review is to provide an insight into the effect of gender and sex hormones on vascular oxidative stress. 2. When production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is enhanced and/or their metabolism by anti-oxidant enzymes is impaired, a condition known as 'oxidative stress' can develop. Oxidative stress is believed to play an important role in both the initiation and progression of a variety of vascular diseases, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. NADPH oxidases are believed to be the major source of vascular ROS. Moreover, excessive production of ROS by NADPH oxidases has been linked to the development of vascular oxidative stress. 3. Increasing evidence suggests that levels of vascular ROS may be lower in women than men during health and disease. Indeed, the activity and expression of vascular NADPH oxidase is lower in female versus male animals under healthy, hypertensive and atherosclerotic conditions. 4. Gonadal sex hormones may play an important role in the regulation of vascular oxidative stress. For example, oestrogens, which are present in highest levels in premenopausal women, have been reported to lower vascular oxidative stress by modulating the expression and function of NADPH oxidases, as well as anti-oxidant enzymes. 5. Further studies are needed to clarify whether lower vascular oxidative stress in women in fact protects against the initiation and development of vascular disease and to further define the roles of gonadal sex hormones in such an effect. Knowledge gained from these studies may potentially lead to advances in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease in both genders."

Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2007 Oct,Pathophysiology,Human,na,"Data from the Framingham Heart Study suggest that women may be more sensitive to the deleterious cardiovascular remodeling effects of aldosterone. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that chronic treatment with spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, decreases ischemic cerebral infarct size and prevents remodeling of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in male spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP). Therefore, we hypothesized that MR antagonism would reduce ischemic infarct size and prevent MCA remodeling in female SHRSP. Six-week-old female SHRSP were treated for 6 wk with spironolactone (25 or 50 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) or eplerenone (100 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) and compared with untreated controls. At 12 wk, cerebral ischemia was induced for 18 h using the intraluminal suture occlusion technique, or the MCA was isolated for analysis of passive structure using a pressurized arteriograph. MR antagonism had no effect on infarct size or passive MCA structure in female SHRSP. To study the potential effects of estrogen, the above experiments were repeated in bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) female SHRSP treated with spironolactone (25 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)). Infarct size and vessel structure in OVX SHRSP were not different from control SHRSP. Spironolactone had no effect on infarct size in OVX SHRSP. However, MCA lumen and outer diameters were increased in spironolactone-treated OVX SHRSP, suggesting an effect of estrogen. Cerebral artery MR expression, assessed by Western blotting, was increased in female, compared with male, SHRSP. These studies highlight an apparent sexual dimorphism of MR expression and activity in the cerebral vasculature from hypertensive rats."

Several vascular risk factors including systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol levels increased at higher rates among women compared with men in each successively older cohort from 35 to 64 years.A higher prevalence of stroke may exist among women aged 45 to 54 years compared with similarly aged men. This potential disparity could be due in part to inadequate stroke risk factor modification in women and is deserving of further study."

We test the hypothesis that sense of coherence (SOC), a marker of social stress adaptive capacity, is associated with incident stroke in a population-based prospective cohort study.A total of 20,629 participants, aged 41 to 80 years, in the UK European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk study, who had not previously experienced a stroke, completed assessments that included SOC and details of their experience of life events during adulthood. An index of adaptation was constructed from responses to questions concerning over 80,000 adverse life events.During 145,000 person-years of follow-up (mean 7.1 years), 452 participants experienced either a fatal or nonfatal stroke event. A strong (as opposed to a weak) SOC was associated with a reduced rate of stroke incidence (rate ratio 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.96) after adjustment for age, sex, pre-existing myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypertension treatment, family history of stroke, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, obesity, social class, education, hostility and depression. No sex difference in this association was observed. Measures of social adversity occurrence and impact were not associated with stroke incidence, whereas faster reported adaptation to adverse event exposure was associated with a reduced rate of stroke incidence (rate ratio 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.98; per standard deviation change in adaptation score, adjusted for age and sex).Stress adaptive capacity is a potentially important candidate risk factor for stroke."

We investigated gender differences in the incidence of craniocervical and ascending aortic atherosclerosis and other risk factors for stroke in elderly patients (age > or =60 yr) undergoing CABG surgery.Data were prospectively collected on 720 patients (31.8% women) undergoing CABG surgery. All patients underwent preoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging and angiography to assess for prior cerebral infarctions, carotid artery stenosis, and intracranial arterial stenosis. Epiaortic ultrasound was performed at the time of surgery to assess for atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta. Cognitive status was measured using the Hasegawa-dementia score in all patients before surgery and on the seventh postoperative day.Women were older and had more hypertension and intracranial arterial stenosis than did men. Men had significantly higher rates of hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, smoking history, severe carotid artery stenosis, and severe aortic atherosclerosis than did women. Although there were no differences in prior cerebral infarction or preoperative cognitive impairment, the rate of perioperative stroke was marginally higher in men than in women (3.9% vs 1.3%, P = 0.066). Univariate predictors of perioperative stroke were prior cerebral infarctions, ascending aortic atherosclerosis, preexisting cognitive impairment, and peripheral vascular disease. Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that significant independent predictors of perioperative stroke were prior cerebral infarctions and aortic atherosclerosis.These data suggest that men are more likely than women to have risk factors for stroke, including severe carotid artery stenosis, severe aortic atherosclerosis, and peripheral vascular disease. The rates of prior cerebral infarction and preoperative cognitive impairment were similar between genders."

Reductions in mortality, MI, and stroke predominantly contributed to the reduction in cardiovascular events in men taking statins. Women did not have a reduction in mortality or stroke, suggesting that the reductions in cardiac events may have been predominantly due to reductions in need for revascularization and/or unstable angina.Statins reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in men and women, but women on statins may not have reductions in mortality and stroke like their male counterparts."

Between 1999 and 2005, all cases with a final diagnosis of cerebral infarction (ICD-10 I63) or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICD-10 I61) were selected. Datasets with missing values for sex and time to admission, as well as datasets of patients transferred between hospitals in the acute phase, were excluded. Main outcome measures were the probability of being admitted within the first 3 hours of stroke onset and being treated with thrombolytic agents for both women and men, after adjustment for age, prestroke disability, severity of clinical symptoms, vascular risk factors, and final diagnosis.Fifty-three thousand four hundred fourteen patients were included (49.3% female; mean+/-SD age, 72.1+/-12.5 years). Women had a 10% lower chance of being admitted within the first 3 hours than men (odds ratio=0.902, 95% CI=0.860 to 0.945, P<0.001). This chance further decreased in elderly women. Similarly, the chance of a female stroke patient being treated with thrombolysis was 13% lower than that of a male patient (odds ratio=0.867, 95% CI=0.782 to 0.960, P=0.006). For patients admitted within the 3-hour time window, the chance of being treated with thrombolysis was similar for women and men (odds ratio=0.915, 95% CI=0.809 to 1.035, P=0.156).We identified sex disparities in acute stroke management in terms of early hospital admission and thrombolytic treatment. This is best explained by the sociodemographic fact that ""surviving spouses"" are more likely to be women than men. Attempts to overcome disadvantages in their access to acute stroke care should focus on increased social support."

The perceived impairments were established with the Patient Competency Rating.Patients' initial depression was identified as being the main predictor for perceived impairment. Gender differences were also found; men were seen to have suffered from a considerable increase in perceived impairment.Patients' self-reports can be used as a valid measurement of their disabilities in various domains. The impact of depression and the gender differences indicate that rehabilitation should focus more strongly on interventions that promote emotional coping and reduce depressive symptoms."

SHRSP, kept on a high-salt permissive diet (JPD), develop hypertension, renal and brain damage. In this report we compared the behavior of female and male SHRSP regarding the main aspects of their pathological condition. Brain abnormalities, detected by magnetic resonance imaging, developed spontaneously in males after 42+/-3 days, in females after 114+/-14 days from the start of JPD. Survival was >3-fold longer for females than for males. The development of brain damage was preceded, in both genders, by an inflammatory condition characterized by the accumulation in serum and urine of acute-phase proteins. The increase in thiostatin level was significantly lower and delayed in female in comparison to male SHRSP. During JPD female and male SHRSP developed massive proteinuria, its worsening being significantly slower in females. The alterations of vasculature-bound barriers in kidney and brain were connected with endothelial dysfunction and relative deficiency in nitric oxide (NO). In thoracic aortic rings, basal release of NO was significantly higher in female than in male SHRSP, both if receiving and if not receiving JPD. The gender differences in SHRSP thus appear to be connected to a more efficient control in females of inflammation and of endothelial dysfunction."

Trends for total, stroke and nonstroke vascular mortality were estimated using log-linear Poisson regression models. Gender-specific mortality rates were standardized directly by 5-year groups to the 1990 French population.During the 1979-2001 period, the mean annual percentage change in vascular death rates varied across age groups (<35, 35-54, 55-64, 65-74, >or=75) between -2.4 to -3.3% in men and -2.5 to -4.1% in women.

BRL 52537 had no effect in the WT or nNOS(-/-) female mice. These data support that BRL 52537's mechanism of neuroprotection in vivo is through attenuation of nNOS activity and ischemia-evoked NO production. Neuroprotective effects of BRL 52537 are lost in the male when nNOS is not present; therefore, BRL 52537 likely acts upstream from NO generation and its subsequent neurotoxicity."

Stroke severity, cognitive impairment, post-stroke depression as well as risk factors were evaluated.Before the stroke 48 patients (13%) lived in special housing (service flats or nursing homes), and one year after the stroke, 50 of the survivors (20%) lived in such accommodations. Before the stroke, 80 (21%) of the patients needed help with their personal ADL, while 90 (36%) needed help after one year. The increased need was fulfilled by relatives. Female spouses more often helped their male counterparts, and they tended to accept a heavier burden. Age, living alone, stroke severity, cognitive impairment, pre-stroke ADL dependency and depression were predictors for special housing.In a time when more and more stroke survivors are cared for at home, it is important to pay attention to the situation of the caregivers. Female caregivers seem to be in an especially exposed position by accepting a heavier burden."

It is not known whether gender differences in patient preferences explain some of the observed variations in stroke care delivery.Outpatients with and without a history of cerebrovascular disease were recruited from stroke, vascular, and general internal medicine ambulatory clinics between September 2002 and October 2003. Self-administered surveys described hypothetical scenarios, and participants were asked if they would accept therapy with thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke or carotid endarterectomy for secondary stroke prevention. The surveys also included questions on sociodemographic factors and decision-making preferences.A total of 586 patients (45% women) completed the survey. Women were less likely than men to accept thrombolysis (79% vs. 86%, P=0.014), even after adjustment for other factors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.92). Women and men were equally likely to accept carotid endarterectomy (82% vs. 84%, P=0.502), even after adjustment for other factors (adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.58- 1.53). Women were less confident in their decisions, were more risk averse, and would have preferred more information to assist them in their decision-making.No gender differences were found in patient preferences for carotid surgery. However, we observed gender differences in patient preferences for thrombolysis and in general attitudes toward stroke care decision-making. Health care providers should be aware that, compared with men, women may be more concerned about risks and may require more information before they make a decision."

An one-year prospective population-based study among the permanent residents of the Canton Basle-City (188015 inhabitants, census 2002) was carried out. Multiple overlapping sources of information were used. Stroke was defined according to the WHO criteria. The diagnosis of FEIS was based on clinical assessment and neuroimaging findings. 269 patients (114 males; mean age 72.8, standard deviation (SD) +/- 12 and 155 females; mean age 78.4, SD +/- 11) with FEIS were identified. The overall crude incidence of FEIS amounted to 143 per 100000 population (95% confidence interval (CI) 126 to 160) and it was higher among females (156; 95% CI 132 to 181) than in males (128; 95% CI 105 to 152). The age-specific incidence rates of FEIS approximately doubled with each decade of life, increasing from 17 (95 % CI 2 to 31) among 0-44 years old group to 1034 (95% CI 774 to 1293) for those aged 85 or more years. The overall incidence rate of FEIS adjusted for age to the European standard population was 76 per 100000 inhabitants (95% CI 66 to 86) and it was higher in males-89, 95% CI 72-106-than in females-66, 95 % CI 53-77. Moreover, in comparison with studies from other developed countries (e. g. Germany, Italy, Australia)-carried out in the middle of 1990s-the standardised incidence rates of FEIS were substantially lower in Switzerland. Our results indicate that the risk of ischemic stroke might be low in Switzerland. However, giving a major reduction in the age and gender specific stroke incidence over the past years our findings might-alternatively-mirror this favourable trend."

The primary outcome was walking speed over 6 minutes, and secondary outcome measures were Human Activity Profile, Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short-Form survey (SF-36), Physiological Cost Index, and lower extremity muscle strength.The 6-minute walking speed increased significantly in both groups and remained significantly improved by 1 year. The Human Activity Profile demonstrated an increasing trend only in the supervised group that was significant by 1 year. The SF-36 Physical Component summary score increased significantly in the supervised group and remained improved by 1 year; the unsupervised group showed significant improvement at 1 year.

Stroke knowledge remains low for both sexes, but little is known about the recognition and translation of stroke symptoms in women. Although sex differences in out-of-hospital delays are not widespread, there is some evidence to suggest that, due to in-hospital delays during acute stroke, access to care may be more problematic for women. Overall, barriers to acute stroke therapy in women are not well understood.tPA utilization is poor overall and may be poorer still in women than in men. Future research is needed to understand women's response to specific stroke symptoms, to elucidate sex differences in acute stroke symptom presentation, to determine reasons for in-hospital delays in women with stroke, and to understand sex-specific differences in response to acute stroke therapy. These research results may then aid in the development of intervention strategies that target women and affect physicians' decisions regarding the use of tPA in this population."

However, the role played by this reaction is not fully understood. The present findings suggest that neuroinflammtory mediators such as cytokines may be involved in a number of key steps in the pathological cascade of events leading to neuronal injury. This hypothesis is strongly supported by experimental and clinical observations indicating that inhibition of the inflammatory reaction correlates with less neuronal damage. Estrogens are thought to play a role in the sex difference observed in many neurological diseases with inflammatory components including stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Clinical and experimental studies have established estrogen as a neuroprotective hormone in these diseases. However, the exact mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effects of estrogens are still unclear. It is possible that the beneficial effects of these hormones may be dependent on their inhibitory activity on the inflammatory reaction associated with the above-mentioned brain pathologies. Here, we review the current clinical and experimental evidence with respect to the inflammation-modulating effects of estrogens as one potential explanatory factor for sexual dimorzphism in the prevalence of numerous neurological diseases."

The long-term effects of erythropoietin on focal cerebral ischemia-induced injury to the developing brain and the potential gender differences in these long-term effects have not been studied in detail. The current study demonstrated a similarity in the mean infarct volume in both the vehicle-treated male and female rats at 6 and 12 weeks after focal cerebral ischemia. On the other hand, erythropoietin treatment (1000 U/kg x three doses after focal cerebral ischemia) caused a significant reduction in the mean infarct volume in both males and females at 6 weeks after focal cerebral ischemia when compared with the corresponding vehicle-treated animals (males: 141.4+/-48.2 mm3 vs. 194.0+/-59.2 mm3, P<0.05; females: 85.4+/-31.6 mm3 vs. 183.4+/-46.3 mm3, P<0.05). Interestingly, the reduction in the mean infarct volume in the erythropoietin-treated males was significantly less than that in the erythropoietin-treated females at 6 weeks after focal cerebral ischemia (141.4+/-48.2 mm3 vs. 85.4+/-31.6 mm3, P<0.05). At 12 weeks after focal cerebral ischemia, the mean infarct volume in the erythropoietin-treated males significantly increased to 181.0+/-50.4 mm3 (P<0.05). In contrast, the mean infarct volume in the erythropoietin-treated females remained stable (87.0+/-41.7 mm3). Additionally, erythropoietin treatment significantly improved sensorimotor function recovery with a misstep number similar to the sham-operation group at 6 and 12 weeks after focal cerebral ischemia. Moreover, the mean number of missteps in the erythropoietin-treated females was less than that in males at 6 (13.5+/-2.0 vs. 24.5+/-2.5, P<0.05) and 12 (12.5+/-2.0 vs. 20.0+/-2.0, P<0.05) weeks after focal cerebral ischemia.

Mean +/- SD age was 77.5 +/- 8.3 years in women and 71.8 +/- 9.7 years in men (p < 0.021). Risk factors for stroke including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure and valvular heart disease were significantly more common in women.

This paper presents the results of three population-based registers in Auckland (1981-1982, 1991-1992, and 2002-2003) which aimed to determine the trends in the incidence of stroke in New Zealand. This paper reports on the burden of stroke in women across different ethnic groups over the study period from 1981 to 2003.Three studies using similar methodology and overlapping case finding methods have been conducted in New Zealand to estimate trends in the incidence and outcome of stroke. The studies are recognised as meeting the 'ideal' criteria for stroke incidence and identify all first-ever and recurrent strokes in residents (aged greater than and equal to 15 years) the population of Auckland, New Zealand in the 12-month periods from 1981-1982, 1991-1992, and 2002-2003. There were totals of 307,578 strokes among women in 1981, 372,642 in 1991, and 470,727 in 2001, according to each Census representing over 50% of the population at each period (51%-54%). The WHO standard world population was used for direct age standardisation of annual rates (per 100,000 population), reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI).The proportion of women who have experienced a stroke did not change markedly over the study period but there were ethnic differences emerging which were related to population changes within the New Zealand population. Standardised stroke incidence in women was relatively stable across the three study periods (1981-1982), 133 [95% CI 118-151]; (1991-1992), 143 [95% CI 116-241]; and (2002-2003), 124 [95% CI 115-134]). However, a significant decline of 14% (95% CI 2%-29%) in rates of first-ever stroke was found between 1991-1992 and 2002-2003 in women. In contrast to the significant declines in event rates in European women over two decades (Rate ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.96), increasing trends in event rates in Pacific women were observed (2.71 95% CI 1.00-7.29). The rate of stroke for Maori women did not change significantly over time. Over half of the women who had a stroke event reported that they had high blood pressure; one in four reported that they had diabetes. The proportion of women who smoked declined over time but increases in body mass index (BMI) indicated weight gains in women over time. These trends were consistent across ethnic groups. Women's survival after 1 month following their stroke has improved by 39% (p<0.0001) over the 20-year period. Favourable changes in early survival were most pronounced in European women.There was a modest decline in stroke incidence in women (overall and for New Zealand European women in particular) in Auckland over the past 20 years but there also was a trend towards increasing stroke incidence in Maori, Pacific, and Asian women. These divergent trends are likely to be associated with different trends in the prevalence of risk factors in these ethnic populations. Targeted stroke prevention programmes are needed in New Zealand to meet the needs of specific ethnic groups as well as the needs of providing ongoing care and support to women following their stroke."

Stroke severity was measured using the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (0-58); computed tomography determined stroke type. A risk factor profile was obtained for all including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Date of death was obtained within a 10-year follow-up period. Predictors of death were identified using a Cox proportional hazards model.Of 999 patients, 559 (56%) were women and 440 (44%) were men. Women were older (77.0 v 70.9 years; P < .001) and had more severe strokes (Scandinavian Stroke Scale: 36.1 v 40.5; P < .001). Age-adjusted risk factors showed no difference between sexes for ischemic heart disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke. Men more often were smokers and alcohol consumers. Unadjusted survival in men and women did not differ: 70.3% versus 66.7% (1-year), 40.0% versus 38.9% (5-year), and 17.4% versus 18.7% (10-year), respectively. Adjusting for age, stroke severity, stroke type, and risk factors, women had a higher probability of survival at 1 year (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.10-2.00); 5 years (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.23-1.76); and 10 years (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.28-1.76).

16046844,No," Jerome Y Yager, Deborah M Saucier",A new model for determining the influence of age and sex on functional recovery following hypoxic-ischemic brain damage.,Developmental neuroscience,2005 Mar-Aug,Pathophysiology,Human,na,"Stroke is a disorder affecting the lives of all age groups, and particularly those at the opposite ends of the age spectrum. It is generally believed that the immature brain is more resistant to damage resulting from a hypoxic/ischemic injury, and that it is also more 'plastic' in terms of its ability to recover. Evidence from our laboratory, and a host of others, has indicated, however, that the developing brain may in fact be more sensitive to injury resulting from hypoxia-ischemia. The question remains, however, whether the immature brain has a greater capacity for recovery. In order to determine the relative capability for functional recovery between age groups, a stroke model of comparable injury is required. This paper describes a new rodent model of ischemic injury allowing for comparisons of behavioral recovery spanning the spectrum of ages between newborn and the elderly. Endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor, was stereotactically injected into the brains of 10-, 63-, and 180-day-old Wistar rats, immediately adjacent to the middle cerebral artery. Regionally, the cortex, caudate, and thalamus were most significantly affected, with sparing of the hippocampus. Pathologic assessment indicated a similar degree of injury across age groups affecting the territorial distribution of the middle cerebral artery, with a predominance of damage in the anterior sections of the cortex and caudate (p < 0.05), compared to the posterior sections including the cortex and thalamus. There were no regional differences in the extent of damage between age groups. Interestingly, however, there were significant differences between males and females regarding the overall extent of brain damage (p < 0.05), with males showing greater damage than females. In addition, there were significant regional differences in the extent of damage between males and females, particularly regarding cortical damage (p < 0.05), both anteriorly and posteriorly, and the caudate anteriorly (p < 0.05). Our findings provide an important new model for comparison of brain damage among the entire spectrum of ages affected by stroke. Importantly, this will allow for further investigations regarding both functional recovery and gender difference comparisons. This may have important ramifications for the development of therapeutic interventions that are age and gender specific."

The objective of the study was to determine whether sex differences in stroke recovery can be explained by depressive status beyond older age, stroke severity, prestroke physical functioning, and other medical comorbidities.A total of 459 stroke patients were recruited from acute and subacute facilities in an urban midwestern community. These patients were followed prospectively from stroke onset until 6 months poststroke. All study participants were assessed using standardized stroke outcome measures, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index, the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, and the SF-36 Health Survey physical functioning scale. The Geriatric Depression Scale was used to assess depressive status. Each outcome was measured at baseline (within 2 weeks of stroke onset), as well as 1, 3, and 6 months poststroke. Prestroke physical functioning, stroke characteristics, and comorbidities were also assessed at baseline.Female patients in the study were older than male patients, with a mean age of 71 years for women vs 69 years for men. Female patients reported lower prestroke physical functioning than their male counterparts. Six months after stroke, women in the study were less likely than the men to achieve a score of > or = 95 on the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (hazards ratio [HR] = 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.90), carry out eight of nine instrumental activities of daily living without assistance (HR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30-0.68), and score > or = 90 on the SF-36 Health Survey physical functioning scale (HR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.28-1.01). When age, prestroke physical functioning, stroke severity, and depressive status at baseline were controlled in the analysis, women in the study continued to be less likely (HR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32-0.79) than men in the study to be able to carry out eight of nine instrumental activities of daily living completely without assistance, but there were no observed sex differences in achievement of independence in basic activities of daily living or higher physical functioning.Prestroke physical functioning and depressive symptoms are important factors in the investigation of sex differences in stroke recovery. Lower recovery of activities of daily living and physical functioning in women after stroke may be due to multifactorial effects of older age, poor physical function prior to stroke onset, and depressive status after stroke."

Cardiac rhythm was assessed by ECG and Holter monitor. Data analysis included additional stratification for age and gender.Of a total of 558 patients (66.8 +/- 13.5 years; 45% female) diagnosed with TIA or stroke 28% interpreted their own symptoms correctly as due to stroke. Female patients reporting cardiac arrhythmias and having AF more often correctly interpreted their symptoms as stroke (P = 0.03), considered their symptoms urgent (P = 0.02), considered stroke a medical emergency (P < 0.05) and had shorter prehospital delay times (P = 0.001) compared to female patients not reporting cardiac arrhythmias. Male, younger (< 65 years) and older patient groups showed no such effect, respectively.Females who know to have AF demonstrate better knowledge of stroke symptoms compared to females unaware or without this risk factor. This better knowledge translates into more appropriate behavior during an acute stroke."

Coagulation and fibrinolysis differ between sexes. These findings prompted us to investigate possible gender differences in arterial recanalization after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA).We identified 100 consecutive patients who presented with acute ischemic stroke and received IV tPA within 6 hours of onset. Only patients with large artery anterior circulation strokes, as determined by MRI/MRA or CT/CTA before treatment, who had follow-up vascular study within 72 hour after treatment were included. We compared demographics, clinical features, admission medications, symptom-to-needle and treatment-to-repeat vascular imaging times, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Severity score, radiological and laboratory data, stroke mechanism, and outcome between the sexes.39 patients met all inclusion/exclusion criteria (22 men and 17 women). The recanalization rate was significantly higher in women (94% versus 59%; P=0.02). This difference remained statistically significant after excluding patients whose strokes were attributed to internal carotid artery occlusive lesions, and when the analysis was limited to those treated within 3 hours of stroke onset. All other confounding variables did not differ significantly between the sexes.In our cohort, vascular occlusive lesions were more likely to recanalize in women than men in response to IV tPA. These preliminary findings need to be validated in larger prospective studies."

Neuronally derived NO has been shown to be deleterious in the male but not in the female rodent model of focal ischemic stroke. We tested the hypothesis that BRL provides significant neuroprotection from transient focal ischemia in male but not in female rats.Halothane-anesthetized adult male and female Wistar rats (250 to 275 g) were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by the intraluminal suture technique. Adequacy of MCAO and reperfusion was monitored with laser-Doppler flowmetry over the ipsilateral parietal cortex. In the first experiment, male and female rats were treated in a blinded randomized fashion with vehicle saline or 1 mg/kg per hour BRL infusion started at the onset of reperfusion and continued for 22 hours. In the second experiment, ovariectomized (OVX) female rats were treated with vehicle or BRL. Infarct volume in the cortex and caudoputamen (CP) complex was assessed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining at 72 hours after MCAO.Infarct volume (percentage of ipsilateral structure; mean+/-SEM) was attenuated significantly in male rats with BRL treatment (cortex 23+/-5%; CP 44+/-6%; n=15) compared with vehicle-treated male rats (cortex 38+/-4%; CP 66+/-4%; n=15) but not in female rats (BRL-cortex 26+/-6; CP 55+/-8%; vehicle-cortex 26+/-5; CP 62+/-5%; n=10 each). Neurologic deficit score was improved in BRL-treated male rats but not in female rats. Infarct volume was not different in OVX female rats treated with vehicle or BRL.These data: (1) demonstrate that this dose of selective KOR agonist provides ischemic neuroprotection in male but not female rats, (2) demonstrate that the lack of protection by BRL is not attributable to circulating ovarian hormones, and (3) highlight the importance of using animal models of both sexes in preclinical studies of experimental ischemia."

We used logistic regression to control for potential confounders.Among 988 women treated between 0 and 6 hours from symptom onset, patients receiving rtPA were significantly more likely than those receiving placebo to have a modified Rankin Score < or =1 (40.5% versus 30.3%, P<0.0008). Among 1190 men, the trend toward benefit in the overall group did not reach statistical significance (38.5% versus 36.7%, P=0.52). An unadjusted analysis showed that women were significantly more likely to benefit from rtPA compared with men (P=0.04). Controlling for age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, diabetes, symptom onset to treatment time, prior stroke, systolic blood pressure, extent of hypoattenuation on baseline computed tomography scan and several significant interaction terms (including onset to treatment time-by-treatment and systolic blood pressure-by treatment) did not substantially change the strength of the interaction between gender and rtPA treatment (P=0.04).In this pooled analysis of rtPA in acute ischemic stroke, women benefited more than men, and the usual gender difference in outcome favoring men was not observed in the thrombolytic therapy group. For patients presenting at later time intervals, when the risks and benefits of rtPA are more finely balanced, sex may be an important variable to consider for patient selection."

The median age of the women was 81 years and the men 80 years.A statistically significant gender difference was seen in living conditions. Eighty percent of the women were living alone compared with 28% of the men (CI 48-56%). The informal care given far exceeded that provided by the community: 65% of these elderly people had some kind of informal care and 44% received formal care from the community. There was a gender difference in daily informal personal care, 24% of men and 16% of women (CI 2-18%), and in daily informal household assistance (CI 15-43%).

Stroke symptoms at presentation were similar in women and men, except that women were more likely to present with headaches and were less likely to have brain stem or cerebellar symptoms. There were no sex differences in the use of neuroimaging, thrombolysis, antithrombotic therapy, or consultations. Women were less likely than men to receive care on an acute stroke unit, but this difference was no longer significant after adjustment for age and other factors.

We investigated the novel hypothesis that ischemic cell death from neuronally derived nitric oxide (NO) or poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP-1) activation is sexually dimorphic and that interruption of these molecular death pathways benefits only the male brain. Female neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) knockout (nNOS-/-) mice exhibited exacerbated histological injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) relative to wild-type (WT) females, unlike the protection observed in male nNOS-/- littermates. Similarly, treatment with the nNOS inhibitor (7-nitroindozole, 25 mg/kg) increased infarction in female C57Bl6 WT mice, but protected male mice. The mechanism for this sexually specific response is not mediated through changes in protein expression of endothelial NOS or inducible NOS, or differences in intraischemic cerebral blood flow. Unlike male PARP-1 knockouts (PARP1-/-), female PARP1-/- littermates sustained grossly increased ischemic damage relative to sex-matched WT mice. Treatment with a PARP inhibitor (PJ-34, 10 mg/kg) resulted in identical results. Loss of PARP-1 resulted in reversal of the neuroprotective activity by the female sex steroid, 17beta estradiol. These data suggest that the previously described cell death pathways involving NO and PARP ischemic neurotoxicity may be operant solely in male brain and that the integrity of nNO/PARP-1 signaling is paradoxically protective in the female."

The importance of hormonal influences on stroke outcome has pointed out the importance of gender, age, and presence of neural hormones. This clinical data has been substantiated by various experimental studies using clinically relevant models of cerebral ischemia and stroke. Published findings emphasize that male and female animals respond differently to periods of cerebral ischemia and that various combinations of hormonal treatments can provide protection, both histopathological and behavioral. Mechanisms underlying the hormonal effects on ischemic outcome are multifactorial. These include effects on vascular integrity and cerebral blood flow, excitotoxicity, oxidation pathways, inflammation, and apoptosis. Although many studies have shown positive results with hormonal treatments, negative findings have also been presented. Explanations for the limitations of hormonal treatment include uncertainties regarding therapeutic window, specific therapeutic dose range, as well as the specific pathophysiological processes being targeted. Additional studies are therefore required to clarify under what conditions hormonal therapy is most protective or not warranted. Experimental studies utilizing a variety of cerebral ischemia and stroke models are reviewed to indicate under what conditions sex differences and hormonal therapy are most important in terms of functional outcome."

Some studies, however, identified gender as an independent risk factor for perioperative CEA complications demonstrating an increased rate of perioperative stroke or death in women. Furthermore, contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion has been associated with higher rates of perioperative CEA complications. Therefore, we sought to analyse the gender-specific risk of perioperative CEA complications between patients with or without contralateral ICA stenosis or occlusion. We retrospectively analysed 212 consecutive CEA patients (male = 156, Female = 56) for their gender-specific, perioperative risk of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), restenosis and cardiac complications in the presence (62%) or absence (38%) of a contralateral ICA stenosis/occlusion. In women but not in men, risk of perioperative ischemic events (stroke, TIA) or re-stenosis (p = 0.036) and combined perioperative complications (ischemic events, re-stenosis or cardiac complications; 38.2 % vs. 9.1%; p = 0.028) was significantly increased in the presence of a contralateral ICA stenosis or occlusion.

Our study suggests that women with contralateral ICA stenosis or occlusion may have a significantly higher risk for perioperative CEA complications than other subgroups of CEA patients. This risk increase seems to be gender-specific and, if confirmed in larger prospective studies, may influence ICA stenosis therapy in the presence of a contralateral ICA stenosis/occlusion in female patients."

Operative risk of stroke and death was also determined in relation to the time to surgery. Analyses were stratified by sex and type of presenting event.The 30-day perioperative risk of stroke and death was unrelated to the time since the last symptomatic event and was not increased in patients operated <2 weeks after nondisabling stroke. In contrast, the risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke in the medical group fell rapidly with time since event (P<0.001), as did the absolute benefit from surgery (P=0.001). This decline in benefit with time was unrelated to the type of presenting event but was more pronounced in women than men (difference P<0.001).

Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios, comparing men and women, and adjusting for age, and age and stroke subtype. Age and gender-matched controls were then compared to distinguish stroke-related disability from disability associated with general aging. Results showed that almost half (43%) of all elderly stroke survivors in the cohort had moderate to severe neurological deficits. In the crude analyses, women were more dependent in ADLs (33.9% vs 15.6%), less likely to walk unassisted (40.3% vs 17.8%), and living in nursing homes (34.9 % vs 13.3%). After adjusting for age and stroke subtype, it was older age that accounted for the severity of disability. When compared to age and gender-matched controls, stroke cases were significantly more disabled in all domains studied. In this elderly cohort, more women experienced initial strokes and were more disabled at 6 months post-stroke than men. However, older age at stroke onset, not gender or stroke subtype, was associated with greater disability. Health care providers need to understand that strokes occur later in life for women and that because of age, women are at greater risk for disability and institutionalization."

Adjustment for the other risk factors decreased the hazard ratios only slightly. Among women, there was also a direct but statistically nonsignificant association between headache and the risk of stroke.Chronic headache is an independent predictor of stroke among men. Since the association between headache and the risk of stroke was particularly strong during a short follow-up, chronic headache may be a marker of the underlying disease process leading to acute stroke. The sex difference observed in this association may be due to a higher prevalence and a more heterogeneous etiology of headache in women compared with men."

Compared with girls, boys had a higher case fatality rate for ischemic stroke (17 vs 12%; p = 0.002) but not for ICH or SAH.Rates of hospitalization for stroke are higher among black children and boys; sickle cell disease and trauma do not fully account for these findings."

The purpose of this study was to analyze possible sex differences in patients suffering first-ever acute stroke.From December 1995 to January 2002, 1581 patients with first-ever acute stroke were analyzed, taking into account sex, age, risk factors, clinical presentation, stroke subtype, treatment, and outcome data.Mean age was higher in women than in men (P<0.001). Hypertension (P=0.0027) and cardioembolic disease (P=0.0035) were independent factors related to women. Alcohol overuse (P<0.001), smoking (P<0.001), and vascular peripheral disease (P=0.031) were related to the male sex. Women more often suffered aphasic disorders (P<0.001), visual field disturbances (P<0.05), and dysphagia (P<0.01) than men. There were no differences in hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes according to sex. Women suffered more cardioembolic strokes (P<0.001); men suffered more atherothrombotic (P<0.001) and lacunar strokes (P<0.05). Women who survived remained more disabled than men (P<0.001).Sex determines some clear differences in patients suffering a first-ever stroke. Women were, on average, 6 years older than men and had a different profile of vascular risk factors and a different distribution of stroke subtypes. Women had a longer hospital stay and remained more disabled than men. The amelioration of hypertension control and increase in anticoagulant treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation would be the best options for preventing stroke, especially in women."

The objective of this study was to verify and explain differences between men and women in management and outcome after stroke in a national perspective.In 2001, 20 761 stroke patients were registered in Riks-Stroke, the national quality register for stroke care in Sweden in which all 84 hospitals participate. Data from 9 hospitals that had reported <70% of the estimated stroke events were excluded from analyses, leaving 19 547 patients (9666 women, 9881 men) at 75 hospitals for the present analyses.Women were older than men (77.8 versus 73.2 years). After age adjustment, female patients were more often disabled, living at home with community support, or in institutions before the stroke. They also had a different cardiovascular risk factor profile. Case fatality ratios during the first 3 months were similar in men and women. After 3 months, more women were physically and mentally impaired and dependent on other persons. Female patients with atrial fibrillation received oral anticoagulants less often than men. Even after multiple adjustments for differences between sexes, female sex was independently associated with institutional living 3 months after the stroke (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.4).Women have a worse prestroke condition. Except for case fatality ratios, they also have a worse outcome after stroke after adjustment for other prognostic factors. There are also sex differences in the medical management of stroke that need to be rectified."

Prior analysis of risk profiles for perioperative stroke that have mostly combined data from women and men may fail to identify gender-specific risks. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patient gender impacts adjusted risk for stroke after cardiac surgery.Demographic and perioperative data were prospectively collected from 2,972 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Carotid artery ultrasound examination was performed before surgery for patients aged 65 yr or older or when there was a history of transient ischemic attacks or prior stroke. Epiaortic ultrasound was performed at the time of surgery in all patients to assess for atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta.Strokes occurred after surgery in 30 women and 18 men (P < 0.0001). Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, a history of a stroke was the strongest predictor of new stroke for both women and men. Low cardiac output syndrome, atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta, and diabetes mellitus were significantly associated with stroke for women but not for men. Analysis on the data from all patients using a gender-interaction term found that the risk for stroke associated with patient age, atherosclerosis of the aorta, diabetes, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was not affected by gender. The prior stroke-gender interaction, however, was significant (P = 0.017), suggesting that a prior cerebrovascular event was a more important predictor of stroke for men than women.These data show that prior stroke before surgery is strongly and independently associated with susceptibility for stroke after cardiac surgery, particularly for men. Other risk factors for perioperative stroke, though, do not appear to be influenced by patient gender."

The current study was designed to evaluate the dose proportionality and pharmacokinetics of BMS-204352 in rats. In an open, parallel fashion, sixteen rats per gender received a single intraarterial dose of BMS-204352 as a 3-min infusion into the carotid artery at 0.4, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg dose levels. Serial blood samples were collected for up to 24 h post-dose and plasma samples were analyzed for the concentrations of intact BMS-204352 using a validated liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric (LC/MS) method. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a non-compartmental method. Results revealed a gender difference in the pharmacokinetics of BMS-204352 in rats at all doses excluding the first (i.e., 0.4 mg/kg) dose panel. BMS-204352 peak plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values increased in a proportion greater than the increment in dose. Specifically, as dose increased in the ratio 1:5:12.5:25, C(max) increased in the ratio 1:7:18:31 in male rats and 1:7:22:51 in female rats. The respective AUC ratios were 1:6:20:42 in male rats and 1:12:29:77 in female rats. Mean total body clearance (CL(T)) values for BMS-204352 ranged from 879-3242 ml/h/kg over the four dose levels and generally decreased with increase in dose. Similarly, steady state volume of distribution (V(SS)) values ranged from 3621-8933 ml/kg over the four dose levels and generally decreased with increase in dose. However, mean residence time (MRT) and elimination half-life (T(1/2)) values for BMS-204352 were independent of dose and ranged from 2.42-4.54 to 2.08-4.70 h, respectively. In conclusion, BMS-204352 appears to exhibit dose-dependent pharmacokinetics in rats. In addition, there appeared to be some evidence of gender related differences in the pharmacokinetics of BMS-204352."

Interview data were available for 1,124 (94%) patients. A physician blinded to sex classified the reported symptoms into 14 categories.Nontraditional stroke symptoms were reported by 28% of women and 19% of men (odds ratio 1.62; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.2). Nontraditional stroke symptoms, pain (men 8%, women 12%) and change in level of consciousness (men 12%, women 17%), were more often reported by women. Traditional stroke symptoms, imbalance (men 20%, women 15%) and hemiparesis (men 24%, women 19%), were reported more frequently by men. Trends were also found for women to present with nonneurologic symptoms (men 17%, women 21%) and men to present with gait abnormalities (men 11%, women 8%). There was no sex difference in the mean number of symptoms reported by an individual patient.This study suggests that a sex difference exists in reporting of acute stroke symptoms. Women with validated strokes present more frequently with nontraditional stroke symptoms than men. Recognition of this difference might yield faster evaluation and management of female patients with acute stroke eligible for acute therapies."

We calculated rate ratios and 95% CIs comparing women with men within age and racial/ethnic groups.Age-specific rates of ischemic and intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke deaths were lower for women than for men aged 25 to 44 and 45 to 64 years but were higher for ischemic stroke among older women, aged > or =65 years. Only among whites did women have higher age-standardized rates of ischemic stroke. Age-standardized death rates for intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke among women were lower than or similar to those among men in all racial/ethnic groups. Women had higher risk of death from subarachnoid hemorrhagic; this sex differential increased with age.The female-to-male mortality ratio differs for stroke subtypes by race/ethnicity and age.

The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of testosterone on neuronal injury in both a cell-culture model and a rodent ischemia-reperfusion model. Glutamate-induced HT-22 cell-death model was used to evaluate the effects of testosterone on cell survival. Testosterone was shown to significantly increase the toxicity of glutamate at a 10 microM concentration, whereas 17beta-estradiol significantly attenuated the toxicity at the same concentration. In a rodent stroke model, ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced by temporal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h and reperfusion for 24 h. To avoid the stress-related testosterone reduction, male rats were castrated and testosterone was replaced by testosterone pellet implantation. Testosterone pellets were removed at 1, 2, 4, or 6 h before MCAO to determine the duration of acute testosterone depletion effects on infarct volume. Ischemic lesion volume was significantly decreased from 239.6 +/- 25.9 mm(3) in control to 122.5 +/- 28.6 mm(3) when testosterone pellets were removed at 6 h before MCAO. Reduction of lesion volume was associated with amelioration of the hyperemia during reperfusion. Our in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that sex differences in response to brain injury are partly due to the consequence of damaging effects of testosterone."

This study was undertaken for the evaluation of whether there is a difference between men and women in early postoperative outcome after CEA and whether such a difference is consistent across other predictors.We conducted a retrospective review of all CEAs entered into our departmental registry between January 1, 1989, and November 30, 2000. A total of 3422 CEAs was performed in 3077 consecutive patients. The ratio of men to women was 2:1, and the ratio of patients who were asymptomatic to patients who were symptomatic was 2.3:1. The following in-hospital outcome data were analyzed: transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, mortality, combined TIA or stroke, and combined stroke or mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis results of selected risk factors for an adverse perioperative event were assessed with generalized estimating equation analysis with backwards selection. The following risk factors were considered: gender, preoperative neurologic status, urgency of operation, type of arteriotomy repair, reoperative CEA for recurrent stenosis, history of cardiopulmonary disease, previous coronary artery intervention, simultaneous CEA and coronary bypass grafting surgery, renal failure, and diabetes.Univariate analysis results of gender differences revealed that women were at higher risk for a postoperative TIA or stroke (3.3% for women versus 2.1% for men; odds ratio [OR], 1.6; confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 2.5; P =.03) and for postoperative stroke or mortality (3.1% for women versus 2.1% for men; OR, 1.6; CI, 1.04 to 2.5; P =.03). Multivariate analysis results showed that female gender was an independent predictor for a postoperative TIA or stroke (OR, 1.7; CI, 1.1 to 2.6; P =.03). Further analysis disclosed that women who were asymptomatic were at greater risk than were men for postoperative stroke or mortality (OR, 2.3; CI, 1.3 to 3.9; P =.003). Conversely, there was no gender association for postoperative stroke or mortality in the consideration of only patients who were symptomatic (OR, 1.0; CI, 0.45 to 2.1; P =.95). The interaction between women and preoperative symptoms approached significance (P =.07) with respect to postoperative stroke and mortality rate, which suggests that the gender effect could be influenced by the clinical presentation.The combined TIA or stroke and stroke or mortality rates are higher in women as compared with men in the postoperative period, but these risks remain acceptable when CEA is performed for appropriate indications. The interaction between symptoms and gender suggests that, in patients who are asymptomatic, women are more likely than are men to have early complications. However, there is no gender difference in patients who are symptomatic. Therefore, despite a low postoperative complication rate, CEA is appropriate in both women who are asymptomatic and women who are symptomatic only if the postoperative TIA, stroke, and mortality rates are appreciably lower than in the natural history of medical management of these patients."

Following an 8 week feeding period, the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), produced from deoxyguanosine under conditions of oxidative stress, in the urine of male and female resveratrol-treated SHRSP were significantly lower than that in control SHRSP. 4. The urine of resveratrol-treated male and female SHRSP had lower levels of hydroperoxide compared with control SHRSP, but the difference was not significant. 5. Treatment with resveratrol resulted in a 25 and 30% reduction in plasma glycated albumin in male and female SHRSP, respectively, compared with controls. 6. Gender differences for SHRSP with regard to 8-OHdG, hydroperoxide and glycated albumin levels were not confirmed, resveratrol having similar protective effects on male and female SHRSP. 7. These results indicate that dietary resveratrol: (i) plays a role in suppressing oxidative DNA damage and glycoxidative stress in vivo; and (ii) has similar protective effects in both male and female SHRSP, suggesting that the direct effects of this phytoestrogen on oxidative stress in vivo are not sexually dimorphic."

Recently, a common mutation (C677T) in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene reducing the activity of MTHFR and increasing homocysteine levels in plasma was reported. The C677T MTHFR mutation may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke, but the results of previous studies have been conflicting. One possible explanation is that the association with the MTHFR genotype may be different according to gender. To investigate the association for ischemic stroke, we conducted a case-control study of 77 hospital cases (49 men and 28 women) with ischemic stroke and 229 (120 men and 109 women) control subjects in Japanese. The prevalence of conventional vascular risk factors and MTHFR genotypes were determined in case and controls. After adjustment by multiple analysis in all there was no statistical significance in MTHFR genotypes. The conventional vascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 17.21), hypertension (adjusted OR, 4.67), smoking habit (adjusted OR, 4.70), and hyperlipidemia (adjusted OR, 2.73) were identified independently associated with ischemic stroke. With a separate sex analysis it was identified that the relationship of the MTHFR T/T gneotype was statisticaly significant in women (adjusted OR, 9.49; 95% CI, 1.75-51.47, P=0.0091). The relevance of the MTHFR T/T mutation appears to be restricted to women, suggesting a role of female hormones in the resistance to elevated homocysteine levels due to the MTHFR T/T mutation."

Because reproductive steroids have vasoactive properties, the authors assessed the effects and mechanisms of action of 17-beta-estradiol in rabbit isolated basilar artery. Cumulative doses of 17-beta-estradiol (0.3 micromol/L to 0.1 mmol/L) induced concentration-dependent relaxation that was larger in basilar than carotid artery, in male than female basilar artery, and in KCl-precontracted than UTP-precontracted male basilar artery. Endothelium removal did not modify relaxation induced by 17-beta-estradiol in basilar artery, whereas relaxation induced by acetylcholine (1 nmol/L to 0.1 mmol/L) was almost abolished. Neither the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 (1 micromol/L), nor the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (1 micromol/L) affected 17-beta-estradiol-induced relaxations. Relaxations induced by the K(+) channel openers NS1619 and pinacidil in the same concentration range were greater and lower, respectively, when compared with relaxation to 17-beta-estradiol, which was not significantly modified by incubation with the K(+) channel blockers charybdotoxin (1 nmol/L and 0.1 micromol/L) or glibenclamide (10 nmol/L and 1 micromol/L). Preincubation with 17-beta-estradiol (3 to 100 micromol/L) produced concentration-dependent inhibition of CaCl(2)-induced contraction, with less potency than the Ca(2+) entry blocker nicardipine (0.01 to 10 nmol/L). The authors conclude that 17-beta-estradiol induces endothelium-independent relaxation of cerebral arteries with tissue and gender selectivity. The relaxant effect is because of inhibition of extracellular Ca(2+) influx to vascular smooth muscle, but activation of estrogen receptors, protein synthesis, or K(+) efflux are not involved. Relatively high pharmacologic concentrations of 17-beta-estradiol causing relaxation preclude acute vascular effects of physiologic circulating levels on the cerebral circulation."

Evidence is lacking as to whether or not there are significant gender differences in the incidence and outcome of stroke in the clinical setting. Recent clinical epidemiological studies have demonstrated that there is no significant association between the use of hormonal replacement therapy and the risk of stroke. However, several animal studies have shown that there are gender differences in stroke outcome and that exogenous administered estrogens are neuroprotective. In this study, the influence of gender differences and the effects of synthetic and non-synthetic estrogens were examined in a model of focal cerebral ischemia using 210 male, intact female, and ovariectomized female rats. All animals underwent 3 h of middle cerebral artery and bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. After 72 h, the rats were sacrificed and stained for histological assessment of infarction. There were no gender differences in infarction volume. Intravenous administration of either low or high dose 17 beta-estradiol or tibolone did not alter infarct volume. Subcutaneous administration of low and high dose 17beta-estradiol using 7-day release pellets did not alter infarct volume. Low dose tibolone using implanted 7-day release pellets did not alter infarct volume. However, high dose tibolone using implanted 7-day release pellets significantly (P<0.05) reduced infarct volume only in ovariectomized female rats. These results demonstrate that estrogen therapy has no effect on infarction volume following severe focal cerebral ischemia."

In this study the effects of sex and age on the positivity of the past history were analyzed numerically. Sex- and age-specific proportion of a positive history of stroke among 24,007 family members was obtained from a questionnaire survey of 2,316 high school students. By analyzing the sex- and age-specific proportion with the logistic regression model odds ratios resulting from sex and age difference were estimated. The odds ratio for sex difference was 2.458 (95% confidence interval: 2.067-2.924) and odds ratio for age difference was 1.064 (95% confidence interval: 1.058-1.070). This indicated that a positive history of stroke was 2.458 times higher in male members than in female members of the same age and that a positive history increased by (1.064)y, where y was age difference in years. Potential bias or misclassification resulting from disregarding sex and age can be substantial.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the prevalence of different degrees of aortic plaque thickness differed in men and women with ischemic stroke.We performed transesophageal echocardiography in 152 patients aged >59 years with acute ischemic stroke (76 men and 76 women) and in 152 control subjects of similar age (70 men and 82 women). Odds ratios (ORs) for ischemic stroke with 95% CIs for different plaque thickness definitions were calculated for the overall group and separately for men and women by logistic regression analysis after adjusting for age, arterial hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.Aortic plaques >/=4 mm were significantly more frequent in men than in women (31.5% versus 20.3%, respectively; P:=0.025) and were associated with ischemic stroke in both men (adjusted OR 6.0, CI 2.1 to 16.8) and women (adjusted OR 3. 2, CI 1.2 to 8.8). However, plaques 3 to 3.9 mm in thickness had a significant association with stroke in women (adjusted OR 4.8, CI 1. 7 to 15.0) but not in men (adjusted OR 0.8, CI 0.2 to 3.0). Plaques <3 mm were not associated with a significantly increased stroke risk for either sex.Smaller aortic plaques are significantly associated with ischemic stroke in women but not in men. If the increased prevalence of smaller plaques in women is confirmed to be associated with increased risk for embolic stroke, different cutoff points may have to be adopted in men and women for risk stratification and for decisions regarding medical intervention."

During this period, 298 cerebral infarctions occurred and were divided into 167 lacunar, 62 atherothrombotic, 56 cardioembolic, and 13 undetermined subtypes of infarction on the basis of clinical information including brain imaging and autopsy findings.The age-adjusted incidence of lacunar infarction (3.8 per 1000 person-years for men and 2.0 for women) was higher than that of atherothrombotic infarction (1.2, 0. 7) and cardioembolic infarction (1.3, 0.5) in both sexes. Time-dependent Cox's proportional hazard analysis revealed systolic blood pressure as well as age to be independent risk factors for all subtypes of cerebral infarction except for cardioembolic infarction in men. Additionally, ST depression on ECG, glucose intolerance, and smoking in men and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG and body mass index in women remained significant risk factors for lacunar infarction. ST depression was also significantly related to events of atherothrombotic infarction in women. The risk of atrial fibrillation for cardioembolic infarction was outstandingly high in both sexes, and left ventricular hypertrophy and lower total cholesterol were additional risk factors for cardioembolic infarction in women.In this Japanese population, lacunar infarction was the most common subtype of cerebral infarction and had a greater variety of risk factors, including not only hypertension but also ECG abnormalities, diabetes, obesity, and smoking, than did atherothrombotic infarction or cardioembolic infarction."
10833057,Yes," R L Roof, E D Hall",Gender differences in acute CNS trauma and stroke: neuroprotective effects of estrogen and progesterone.,Journal of neurotrauma,2000 May,Review,Human/Rat,na,"Increasing evidence has demonstrated striking sex differences in the pathophysiology of and outcome after acute neurological injury. Lesser susceptibility to postischemic and posttraumatic brain injury in females has been observed in experimental models. Additional evidence suggests this sex difference extends to humans as well. The greater neuroprotection afforded to females is likely due to the effects of circulating estrogens and progestins. In fact, exogenous administration of both hormones has been shown to improve outcome after cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury in experimental models. The neuroprotection provided by periinjury administration of these hormones extends to males as well. The mechanisms by which estrogen and progesterone provide such neuroprotection are likely multifactorial, and probably depend on the type and severity of injury as well as the type and concentration of hormone present. Both genomic and nongenomic mechanisms may be involved. Estrogen's putative effects include preservation of autoregulatory function, an antioxidant effect, reduction of A beta production and neurotoxicity, reduced excitotoxicity, increased expression of the antiapoptotic factor bcl-2, and activation of mitogen activated protein kinase pathways. It is hypothesized that several of these neuroprotective mechanisms can be linked back to estrogen's ability to act as a potent chemical (i.e., electron-donating) antioxidant. Progesterone, on the other hand, has a membrane stabilizing effect that also serves to reduce the damage caused by lipid peroxidation. In addition, it may also provide neuroprotection by suppressing neuronal hyperexcitability. The following review will discuss experimental and clinical evidence for sex differences in outcome after acute brain trauma and stroke, review the evidence implicating estrogens and progestins as mediators of this neuroprotection following acute neurological injury, and finally, address the specific mechanisms by which these hormones may protect the brain following acute neurological injury."

Our objective was to explore differences in the treatment of stroke between men and women.Secondary database analyses.We examined the use of carotid endarterectomy in a nationally representative sample of Medicare enrollees aged 65 to 84, hospitalized for a principal diagnosis of stroke in 1992, the ""all strokes group"". We also studied a subgroup of patients, the ""carotid disease subgroup"", admitted with a principal diagnosis of precerebral arterial occlusion and stenosis or transient cerebral ischemia.We determined rates of carotid endarterectomy for the all strokes group within gender and age groups and calculated corresponding female-to-male relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We also performed similar analyses for the carotid disease subgroup. We then used logistic regression to estimate the relative risk of use of carotid endarterectomy for women, controlling for age and comorbidity.The all-strokes group consisted of 3,356 women and 2,927 men, of whom 1,009 women and 990 men were in the carotid disease subgroup. The overall age-adjusted female-to-male relative risk of undergoing carotid endarterectomy for those aged 65 to 84 was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.64-0.74) in the all strokes group and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.72-0.82) in the carotid disease subgroup. In both analyses, the RR became more pronounced with increasing age. In the all strokes group, for example, the RR was 0.80 (0.70-0.92) for those aged 65 to 69 and 0.39 (0.32-0.48) for those aged 80 to 84. The RR for the all strokes group remained similar in magnitude even after controlling for comorbidity (RR, 0.63 and 95% CI, 0.59-0.70).We conclude that women hospitalized for strokes undergo fewer carotid endarterectomies than men. Further studies are needed to examine the reasons for and implications of this gender difference."

This sex difference in ischemic brain injury in young animals disappears after surgical ovariectomy and can be restored by estrogen replacement. We sought to determine whether ischemic brain injury continues to be smaller in middle-aged, reproductively senescent female rats compared with age-matched males and to test the effect of ovarian steroids on brain injury after experimental stroke in females.Four groups of 16-month old Wistar rats (males [n=9], untreated females [n=9], and females pretreated with 17beta-estradiol [25-microgram pellets administered subcutaneously for 7 days; n=9] or progesterone [10-mg pellets administered subcutaneously for 7 days; n=9] were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion with the intraluminal filament technique, followed by 22 hours of reperfusion. Physiological variables and laser-Doppler cerebral cortical perfusion were monitored throughout ischemia and early reperfusion. In a separate cohort of males (n=3), untreated females (n=3), females pretreated with 17beta-estradiol (n=3), and females pretreated with progesterone (n=3), end-ischemic regional cerebral blood flow was measured by [(14)C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography.As predicted, infarct size was not different between middle-aged male and female rats. Cortical infarcts were 21+/-5% and 31+/-6% of ipsilateral cerebral cortex, and striatal infarcts were 44+/-7% and 43+/-5% of ipsilateral striatum in males and females, respectively. Both estrogen and progesterone reduced cortical infarct in reproductively senescent females (5+/-2% and 16+/-4% in estrogen- and progesterone-treated groups, respectively, compared with 31+/-6% in untreated group). Striatal infarct was smaller in the estrogen- but not in the progesterone-treated group. Relative change in laser-Doppler cerebral cortical perfusion from preischemic baseline and absolute end-ischemic regional cerebral blood flow were not affected by hormonal treatments.We conclude that the protection against ischemic brain injury found in young adult female rats disappears after reproductive senescence in middle-aged females and that ovarian hormones alleviate stroke injury in reproductively senescent female rats by a blood flow-independent mechanism. These findings support a role for hormone replacement therapy in stroke injury prevention in postmenopausal women."
11186229,No," R L Roof, E D Hall",Estrogen-related gender difference in survival rate and cortical blood flow after impact-acceleration head injury in rats.,Journal of neurotrauma,2000 Dec,Pathophysiology,Rat,na,"While a number of laboratories have begun to examine gender differences in outcome following experimental stroke, little is known about the relative response of male and female brains to traumatic injury. In the following series of experiments, we used the Marmarou impact-acceleration head injury model (with a 500-g, 1.5-m weight drop) to compare the pathophysiological responses of male and female rats to closed-head injury. Cortical blood flow (CBF; laser-doppler flowmetry), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), blood gas levels, blood pH, and body temperature were measured preinjury and at regular intervals postinjury. Acute survival was assessed 1 h after injury. The role of estrogen in the observed gender differences was assessed by examining these physiological measures after injury in ovariectomized females, with or without 17beta-estradiol replacement, and in intact males, with or without exogenous 17beta-estradiol administration. In the first experiment, significantly more females (100%) survived the acute injury period (60 min) after injury than did males (72%). Survival appeared related to the magnitude and persistence of the posttraumatic drop in MAP. In a second experiment, females showed a less dramatic reduction in and better recovery of CBF than males. The gender difference in CBF was paralleled to some degree by differences in the pattern of MAP changes after injury. Differences in body weight, blood gas levels, or blood pH did not account for the gender difference in CBF. Postinjury CBF was higher in female and male rats given 2 weeks of daily 17beta-estradiol injections prior to injury compared to those given the vehicle only. However, 17beta-estradiol administration did not alter MAP, suggesting that the gender difference in CBF was not strictly due to MAP changes. Our findings suggest that estrogen plays a role in maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion in the acute period following closed-head injury. This protective mechanism may underlie the gender difference in acute survival observed in this study, and may help explain observations of better outcome in females than in males after brain injury. We conclude that CBF preservation is one mechanism by which estrogen is neuroprotective following traumatic brain injury. We hypothesize, based upon known effects of estrogen, that the beneficial microvascular effects of estrogen most likely involve a combination of endothelial nitric oxide synthase induction and an antioxidant effect."

However, little data exist on whether similar sex differences exist in stroke patients. We conducted a study to determine whether sex differences exist in patients with acute stroke admitted to Ontario hospitals.Using linked administrative databases, we performed a population-based cohort study. The databases contained information on all 44 832 patients discharged from acute-care hospitals in Ontario between April 1993 and March 1996 with a most responsible diagnosis of acute stroke. The main outcomes measured consisted of sex differences in comorbidities, the use of rehabilitative services, the use of antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulants (in elderly stroke survivors aged > or =65 years only), discharge destination, and mortality.Male stroke patients were more likely than female stroke patients to have a history of ischemic heart disease (18.1% versus 15.3%, respectively; P<0.001) and diabetes mellitus (20.1% versus 18. 7%, respectively; P<0.001), whereas female patients were more likely than male patients to have hypertension (33.8% versus 30.0%, respectively; P<0.001) and atrial fibrillation (12.9% versus 10.2%, respectively; P<0.001). There were no sex differences in the usage of in-hospital rehabilitative services. The overall 90-day postdischarge use of aspirin and ticlopidine was similar in stroke survivors aged 65 to 84 years. However, among stroke survivors aged > or =85 years, men were more likely than women to receive aspirin (36. 0% versus 30.7%, respectively; P<0.001) and ticlopidine (9.2% versus 6.8%, respectively; P=0.007). Use of warfarin was similar for the two sexes. Men were more likely than women to be discharged home (50. 6% versus 40.9%, respectively; P<0.001) and less likely to be discharged to chronic care facilities (16.8% versus 25.2%, respectively; P<0.001). The risk of death 1 year after stroke was somewhat lower in women than men (adjusted odds ratio 0.939, 95% CI 0.899 to 0.980; P=0.004). The mortality differences were greatest among elderly stroke patients.Elderly men are more likely than elderly women to receive aspirin and ticlopidine and equally like to receive warfarin after a stroke.

Subjects included 14 600 people who were living in the community and </=40 years of age, randomly selected from the Leicestershire Health Authority Register.A 70% response rate was achieved with the return of 10 226 questionnaires. Prevalence of reported stroke was 4% (n=423). Prevalence of urinary symptoms was 34% (n=3197). Overall, stroke survivors had a higher prevalence of symptoms than the nonstroke population (64% to 32%, respectively). These symptoms were reported to have more of an effect on the lives of the stroke survivors compared with the nonstroke population even when adjusted for age and sex differences. This reported impact was not related to the stroke per se but to the severity of the urinary symptoms.These data show a high prevalence of urinary symptoms among community-dwelling stroke survivors. These symptoms were reported to have considerable impact on the lives of stroke survivors, which needs to be taken into account in future research and clinical practice."

Although women are at lower risk for stroke than men, this native protection is lost in the postmenopausal years. Therefore, aging women sustain a large burden for stroke, contrary to a popular misconception that cancer is the main killer of women. Further, the value of hormone replacement therapy in stroke prevention or in improving outcome remains controversial. Estrogen has been the best studied of the sex steroids in both laboratory and clinical settings and is considered increasingly to be an endogenous neuroprotective agent. A growing number of studies demonstrate that exogenous estradiol reduces tissue damage resulting from experimental ischemic stroke in both sexes. This new concept suggests that dissecting interactions between estrogen and cerebral ischemia will yield novel insights into generalized cellular mechanisms of injury. Less is known about estrogen's undesirable effects in brain, for example, the potential for increasing seizure susceptibility and migraine. This review summarizes gender-specific aspects of clinical and experimental stroke and results of estrogen treatment on outcome in animal models of cerebral ischemia, and briefly discusses potential vascular and parenchymal mechanisms by which estrogen salvages brain."

It is well-documented that the incidence of stroke is higher in men than in women in all age classes, and women are, on average, several years older than men when they suffer their first stroke. The prevalence of stroke is higher among men up to the age of approximately 80 years, after which it becomes higher in women. A majority of studies indicate that the case-fatality rate is higher in female than in male stroke patients; there is also some evidence, albeit relatively weak, indicating a better functional outcome in men. Gender differences in risk factor profile and treatment response appear to be weak. The burden of providing informal care to stroke patients seems to constitute a threat to the mental health of the caregivers, who are predominantly women."

In some studies, the male/female ratio of ALS patients was as high as 2 to 1. In FALS mice, disease onset and mortality were earlier among males than among females. This sexual dimorphism was due to estrogen, as treatment with genistein, a phytoestrogen, eliminated the observed sexual dimorphism in FALS mice. Genistein treatment also protected against oxygen singlet-induced cerebral damage in vivo. However, sexual dimorphism was not observed in this model of stroke; and genistein was equally effective in males and females. These data suggest that genistein has both estrogen-dependent and estrogen-independent neuroprotective activities and it should be investigated as a prophylactic agent against pathologic conditions such as ALS and stroke."

Compared with noncarriers, carriers of the factor V (FV) Leiden mutation (OR, 2.56), and to a lesser extent, of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) TT genotype (OR, 1.60), had an independent higher estimated risk of having a history of ischemic stroke. The relationship with the FV Leiden mutation was greater in women (OR, 3.95). Thus, in addition to established determinants, FV Leiden mutation is independently associated with the occurrence of ischemic stroke in this setting. The greater association in women suggests the possibility of an interaction of this genotype with female hormones."

We adjusted average annual incidence rates by age and sex to the US 1990 population and compared the age-adjusted frequency of stroke risk factors across ischemic stroke subtypes.Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates (per 100 000 population) were as follows: large-vessel cervical or intracranial atherosclerosis with >50% stenosis, 27; cardioembolic, 40; lacuna, 25; uncertain cause, 52; other or uncommon cause, 4. Sex differences in incidence rates were detected only for atherosclerosis with stenosis (47 [95% CI, 34 to 61] for men; 12 [95% CI, 7 to 17] for women). There was no difference in prior transient ischemic attack and hypertension among subtypes, and diabetes was not more common among patients with lacunar infarction than other common subtypes.The age-adjusted incidence rate of stroke due to stenosis of the large cervicocephalic vessels is nearly 4 times higher for men than for women.

All hospitalized and out-of-hospital deaths occurring during 1990 among the residents of these 2 areas were included. Strokes were classified by an independent panel of neurologists using a standard protocol that included specific criteria for stroke and subtypes.The overall age-adjusted stroke incidence rates (per 100 000 population) were significantly higher in the Pee Dee population (293.1) compared with Anderson (211.2).

The rates in the Pee Dee were higher than the rates from other studies in the United States and other parts of the world. Although the stroke subtypes did not vary between the 2 regions, race-sex differences were identified.High stroke incidence and disease rates persist for all 4 race-sex groups in the Southeast and reflect similar risks as mortality rates. However, geographic variability in stroke rates suggests that the pattern of disease in the region is not so much a ""belt"" of increased stroke in contiguous areas but rather more a ""necklace"" of different levels of risk.

Using resistance-sized arteries pressurized in vitro, we have found that myogenic tone of rat cerebral arteries differs between males and females. This difference appears to result from estrogen enhancement of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production. Luminal diameter was measured in middle cerebral artery segments from males and from females that were either untreated, ovariectomized (Ovx), or ovariectomized with estrogen replacement (Ovx + Est). The maximal passive diameters (0 Ca2+ + 1 mM EDTA) of arteries from all four groups were identical. In response to a series of 10-mmHg step increases in transmural pressure (20-80 mmHg), myogenic tone was greater and vascular distensibility less in arteries from males and Ovx females compared with arteries from either untreated or Ovx + Est females. In the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 1 microM), an NO synthase inhibitor, myogenic tone was increased in all arteries, but the differences among arteries from the various groups were abolished. Addition of L-arginine (1 mM) in the presence of L-NAME restored the differences in myogenic tone, suggesting that estrogen works through an NO-dependent mechanism in cerebral arteries. To determine the target of NO-dependent modulation of myogenic tone, we used tetraethylammonium (TEA; 1 mM) to inhibit large-conductance, calcium-activated K+ (BKCa) channels. In the presence of TEA, the myogenic tone of arteries from all groups increased significantly; however, myogenic tone in arteries from males and Ovx females remained significantly greater than in arteries from either untreated or Ovx + Est females. This suggests that activity of BKCa channels influences myogenic tone but does not directly mediate the effects of estrogen. Estrogen appears to alter myogenic tone by increasing cerebrovascular NO production and/or action."

Cerebrocortical tissue volume with end-ischemic CBF < 10 mL/100 g/min was smaller in F than M rats, but not different from O rats.We conclude that endogenous estrogen improves stroke outcome during vascular occlusion by exerting both neuroprotective and flow-preserving effects."

Data on the relation between stature and stroke is more limited. We examined the association between stature and CHD as well as between stature and stroke in men and women from two communities in southeastern New England.Coronary heart disease and stroke events were abstracted from medical records between January 1980 and December 1991. An epidemiological diagnostic algorithm developed to measure CHD was used in the present analysis. Unadjusted relative risks (RR) and RR adjusted for age, smoking status, obesity, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol <0.91 mmol/l, total cholesterol >6.21 mmol/l, hypertension, diabetes, education, and being foreign born were computed by gender-specific height categories separately for men (n = 2826) and women (n = 3741).A graded inverse association between stature and risk of CHD was observed among men which persisted after adjustment for confounders. Men >69.75 inches had an 83% lower risk of CHD compared with men < or = 65 inches. In addition, the tallest men had a 67% decreased risk of stroke compared with the shortest men. No significant relation between stature and CHD or stroke was observed among women.These data support the hypothesis that stature is inversely related to both risk of CHD and stroke at least among men. Factors which might explain this association remain to be determined."

Factors influencing circulating levels of fibrinogen include age, smoking, gender, and genetic factors. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between a polymorphism at position 448 of the B beta fibrinogen gene, fibrinogen levels, gender, and the risk of stroke. Fibrinogen levels were determined in 305 patients with stroke, taken within 10 days of the acute event and 3 months later, and in 197 control subjects. Initial fibrinogen levels in patients (4.49 g/L) were significantly higher than at 3 months (3.85 g/L, P < .0001), consistent with resolution of the acute-phase response. At 3 months, levels were only significantly higher than for control subjects in the male patients (3.86 g/L versus 3.31 g/L, P < .0001). Fibrinogen levels were associated with B beta 448 genotype in male patients at 3 months (1/1 = 3.62 g/L, 1/2 + 2/2 = 4.27 g/L, P = .01). There was a significant difference in the genotype distribution in female patients and control subjects (patients: 1/1 = 95, 1/2 = 34, 2/2 = 6; control subjects: 1/1 = 61, 1/2 = 50, 2/2 = 3, P = .008). These data suggest that the mechanisms linking fibrinogen and the development of cerebrovascular disease are different in males and females. In male patients, the increase in fibrinogen levels may be influenced by environmental factors, while in females there may be a functional difference in the fibrinogen molecule unrelated to fibrinogen levels."

We therefore investigated the clinical use of a 24-hour oscillometric ABPM device in patients after acute stroke. We also investigated ABPM in different types of stroke (thrombosis, hemorrhage, and transient ischemic attack) and ethnic and sex differences.BP was measured manually with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer, and ABPM measurements were made with an oscillometric device. The first reading obtained with the ABPM device was compared with simultaneous manual BP measurements. Mean daytime and nighttime pressures were also analyzed to determine the frequency of nocturnal BP falls (""dipping"").We studied 86 patients (48 men; mean +/- SD age, 64.2 +/- 9.2 years) admitted with acute-onset stroke (ictus within 12 hours) in a district general hospital. Thirty-one patients (36.0%) had a previous history of hypertension. The median percentage of successful BP readings by ABPM was 92% (interquartile range, 72 to 98). There was no significant difference in manual BP levels compared with the first simultaneous systolic or diastolic ABPM measurements. Systolic BPs recorded by ABPM were significantly higher in black patients with acute stroke and in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, who also showed a trend toward higher nocturnal BPs. There was no difference in BPs between men and women and those who were alive or dead 6 months later (P = NS). There was also no difference between mean day and night systolic BP (mean difference, 1.9 mm Hg; P = .08), although mean daytime diastolic BP was higher than mean nighttime diastolic BP (mean difference, 2.4 mm Hg; P = .01). Patients with stroke therefore demonstrated a loss of diurnal BP rhythm and may be considered ""nondippers""; there was also a trend toward ""reverse dipping"" in patients with intracranial hemorrhage.This study demonstrates higher systolic BPs as recorded by ABPM (but not manually) in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage than in those with cerebral infarcts; higher levels were also found in blacks. ABPM recordings are useful in the assessment of BP in patients with stroke, who may be considered nondippers."

The aim of this study was to analyze mortality rates for stroke in Sweden during the period 1969 through 1993 and to predict mortality trends until the year 2003, taking into account age, cohort, and period effects.Age-period-cohort models were used to analyze stroke mortality in Sweden between 1969 and 1993 and to predict age-specific death rates and total number of deaths for the periods 1994 through 1998 and 1999 through 2003.Mortality rates in the age group 25 to 89 years decreased from 203 to 143 per 100,000 for men and from 185 to 113 per 100,000 for women over the study period (average annual decrease of 1.3% for men and 1.9% for women). The decline was present in all age groups. The full age-period-cohort model provided an acceptable fit in both sexes. Predictions based on these models gave a mortality rate of 122 and 92 per 100,000 for the period 1999-2003 in men and women, respectively. Despite an aging and increasing population, the total number of stroke deaths in Sweden is predicted to decline by approximately 10% in both men and women from 1989-1993 to 1999-2003.Both factors, cohort and calendar period, contain relevant information to explain the decline in stroke mortality trends in Sweden.

Individuals were selected if they had been coded with a diagnosis of CVD (ICD-9 430-438), 1984-1986. Age-sex specific rates were correlated to deprivation score and estimated population risk factors for the 22 local government districts of the Scottish Heart Health Study (1984-1986).Men were more commonly admitted in all districts except one, with an overall male:female ratio of 1.43 (P < 0.0001). Rates for men were significantly higher in populations with elevated mean diastolic blood pressure, greater mean alcohol consumption, and where fewer men ate fruit. The most significant associations of male CVD hospital admissions were with population density and deprivation. A similar pattern was found for women, where CVD was significantly associated with elevated diastolic blood pressure, more smokers and fewer non-smokers, and fewer eating fruit. Again rates were higher in densely populated, deprived districts. Multiple linear regression identified the proportion for men. Sex difference was explained by vitamin C intake.Geographical variation in CVD rates in Scotland is related to identifiable population risk factors for atherosclerosis and urban environment."

Thirty-eight percent had aphasia at the time of admission; at discharge 18% had aphasia. Sex was not a determinant of aphasia in stroke, and no sex difference in the anterior-posterior distribution of lesions was found. The remission curve was steep: Stationary language function in 95% was reached within 2 weeks in those with initial mild aphasia, within 6 weeks in those with moderate, and within 10 weeks in those with severe aphasia. A valid prognosis of aphasia could be made within 1 to 4 weeks after the stroke depending on the initial severity of aphasia.

In the Framingham cohort, the regression model of Cox established the effect on stroke of the following factors: age, systolic blood pressure, the use of antihypertensive therapy, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, prior cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Derived from this model, stroke probabilities were computed for each sex based on a point system. The authors claimed that a physician can use this system for individual stroke prediction.The Copenhagen City Heart Study is a prospective survey of 19,698 women and men aged 20 years or older invited to two cardiovascular examinations at 5-year intervals. The baseline examination included 3015 men and 3501 women aged 55 to 84 years; 474 stroke events occurred during 10 years of follow-up. In both cohorts initial cases of stroke and transient ischemic attack recorded during 10 years of follow-up were used. We used the statistical model from the Framingham Study to establish a corresponding stroke probability point system using data from the Copenhagen City Heart Study population. We then compared the effects of the relevant risk factors, their combinations, and the corresponding stroke probabilities. We also assessed stroke events during 10 years of follow-up in several subgroups of the Copenhagen population with different combinations of risk factors.For the Copenhagen City Heart Study population some of the risk factors (diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy) had regression coefficients different from those of the Framingham Study population. Consequently, the probability of stroke for persons presenting these risk factors and their combinations varied between the two studies. For some other risk factors (age, blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease), no major differences were found. The recorded frequency of stroke events in subgroups of the Copenhagen population was compatible with the estimated probability intervals of stroke from the Copenhagen City Heart Study and with those from the Framingham Study, but these intervals were very large.The majority of risk factors for stroke identified by the Framingham Study also had a significant effect in the Copenhagen City Heart Study population. The differences found could be due partly to different definitions of these factors used by the two studies. Although estimated stroke probabilities based on point systems from the Copenhagen City Heart Study and the Framingham Study were similar, the points scored in the two systems did not always correspond to the same combination of risk factors. Such systems can be used for estimating stroke probability in a given population, provided that the statistical confidence limits are known and the definitions of risk factors are compatible. However, because of the large statistical uncertainty, a prognostic index should not be applied for individual prediction unless it is used as an indicator of high relative risk associated with the simultaneous presence of several risk factors."

Cerebral infarction accounted for 71% of cases (95% CI, 68%-75%), PICH 11% (95% CI, 9%-14%) and SAH 4% (95% CI, 2%-5%). The 382 cases of cerebral infarction included LAOI (in approximately 71%), EMBI (15%), LACI (10%) and BZI (5%). While the incidence of all subtypes of stroke increased with age, there were age and sex differences in their proportional frequency, management and prognosis: patients with PICH, SAH and EMBI were more likely to be admitted to hospital, and these conditions carried the highest early case fatality. Over all, the 28-day case fatality was 24% (95% CI, 20%-28%), but varied from 0 for LACI and BZI, to 37% (95% CI, 15%-59%) for SAH and 35% (CI, 23%-47%) for PICH.In this study, we found considerable differences in incidence rates, the effect of age and sex on incidence rates, and prognosis for the different subtypes of stroke. Hospital-based studies are likely to be selectively biased by emphasising strokes that are severe and require admission to hospital.

For both males and females the incidence of stroke rises exponentially with increasing age. Although the sex-dependent difference in the risk of stroke is greatest in middle age, males are at greater risk of stroke even among the most elderly. To determine the incidence of stroke accurately, population-based studies of stroke need exhaustive and overlapping sources of case ascertainment. If only cases admitted to hospital had been used, we would have underestimated the rate of stroke among the most elderly by almost 40%. We estimate that approximately 37,000 people, about 50% of whom are over the age of 75, suffer a stroke each year in Australia."

In comparison with other studies, age-adjusted incidence rate of stroke in Beijing was higher than in other countries, especially for hemorrhagic stroke. The proportion of hemorrhagic stroke related to other types of stroke was also higher in Beijing. Further analysis of the cases confirmed by computerized tomography also supported this finding. Unlike the incidence rates, the 4-week case fatality rate for women, 39.5%, was higher than for men, 32.8%. This finding was confirmed by a multiple logistic analysis controlling for age (p less than 0.001) and for previous stroke (p less than 0.001).

Urinary immunoreactive TXB2 for this group of ischemic patients was elevated compared to normals, 1818 +/- 344 pg/mg Cr (mean +/- SE) vs 880 +/- 122 pg/mg Cr (p less than .05). Among various subsets of the ischemic patients, those with severe stroke (2108 +/- 536 pg/mg Cr), large vessel disease (1646 +/- 335 pg/mg Cr), and cardiogenic stroke (2712 +/- 1045 pg/mg Cr) were all significantly elevated. Of the stroke patients, only the males demonstrated this significant elevation. These elevations of urinary immunoreactive TXB2 are consistent with a role for increased platelet activation in the pathogenesis of some forms of cerebral ischemia and suggest that gender differences in arachidonate metabolism may exist for stroke patients."

Such comparisons are examined here; they confirm that the major sex differences after such brain damage appear in tasks intended to involve nonverbal processing. This evidence supports the hypothesis that women, to a greater extent than men, may employ verbal, left hemisphere processing to solve ostensibly nonverbal problems."
7470839,No," A Kertesz, A Sheppard","The epidemiology of aphasic and cognitive impairment in stroke: age, sex, aphasia type and laterality differences.",Brain : a journal of neurology,1981 Mar,Outcomes,Human,na,Sex differences and age distribution are examined in various types of aphasia and in right hemisphere-damaged patients due to acute infarct. The language and performance deficits were measured by a standardized test allowing us to group patients meaningfully. The higher male to female ratio of aphasia is shown to relate to a similar sex distribution in infarcts rather than to sex differences in cerebral organization. Broca's aphasics were somewhat younger than the other groups and the slight difference may be related to pathophysiological factors favouring embolic strokes in the anterior territory of the middle cerebral artery. Sex and aphasia types were not significantly different in various age groups except about 50 years of age where the female aphasics reversed the ratio.
7368243,No," B Herman, C W Frenken","Epidemiology of stroke in Tilburg, The Netherlands. The population-based stroke incidence register: 1. Introduction and preliminary results.","Stroke, a journal of cerebral circulation",1980 Mar-Apr,Epidemiology,Human,516,"We present the methodology and some preliminary findings of a population-based stroke incidence register operating in Tilburg (about 150,000 persons), The Netherlands. From October 1, 1978 to March 31, 1979, 152 new strokes occurred giving an estimated overall incidence (per 100,000 population) for total and first attacks of 202 and 162, respectively. No major sex difference in stroke risk (all ages) was noted, although males did have a significantly higher incidence at 55--64 years of age. Stroke incidence increased strikingly with age. Thromboembolic infarcts comprised 83% and intracranial hemorrhage 13% of attacks. Males and females differed little in distribution of stroke types. The proportion of cerebral infarction was higher among older than younger cases. The opposite was true regarding intracranial hemorrhage. Embolic infarcts constituted a significantly higher proportion of cases at 65--74 years of age than at other ages. Hemiplegia and speech deficits dominated the clinical picture at onset. The 3-week case fatality for all strokes was 26%. Both a lowering of consciousness (found among 38% of cases during the first 24 hours) and a history of prior stroke were found related to a reduction in survival. Of patients surviving 3 weeks 25% were completely dependent and 25% partially dependent upon others for personal care."
351394,No,,A randomized trial of aspirin and sulfinpyrazone in threatened stroke. The Canadian Cooperative Study Group.,The New England journal of medicine,1978 Jul 13,Management,Human,585,"Five hundred and eighty-five patients with threatened stroke were followed in a randomized clinical trial for an average of 26 months to determine whether aspirin or sulfinpyrazone, singly or in combination, influence the subsequent occurrence of continuing transient ischemic attacks, stroke or death. Eighty-five subjects went on to stroke, and 42 died. Aspirin reduced the risk of continuing ischemic attacks, stroke or death by 19 per cent (P less than 0.05) and also reduced risk for the ""harder,"" more important events of stroke or death by 31 percent (P less than 0.05), but this effect was sex-dependent: among men, the risk reduction for stroke or death was 48 per cent (P less than 0.005), whereas no significant trend was observed among women. For sulfinpyrazone, no risk reduction of ischemic attacks was observed, and the 10 per cent risk reduction of stroke or death was not statistically significant. No overall synergism or antagonism was observed between the two drugs. We conclude that aspirin is an efficacious drug for men with threatened stroke."
