Compared with men, women were older, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to present in Killip Class III/IV and experience post-infarction angina or HF. After adjusting for baseline differences, both short-term and longer-term mortality were similar in men and women. However, women were more likely than men to experience the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, MI, HF, stroke, and resuscitation from cardiac arrest [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI); 1.06-1.24, P=0.001], mainly owing to an increased risk of hospitalization for HF (adjusted HR 1.36; 95% CI 1.22-1.52; P<0.001). In a subset of patients who underwent echocardiographic study (n=603), women had smaller left ventricular volumes indexed by body size than men but similar ejection fractions and similar changes in ventricular volumes from baseline to 1 month and 20 months.In VALIANT, the risk of HF following MI was higher in women than men after adjusting for age and comorbidities, although the risk of other fatal and non-fatal outcomes were similar. The higher long-term risk of HF in women appears to be independent of the extent of left ventricular systolic dysfunction or remodelling compared with men."

The study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. Included were 24 consecutive female cfLVAD recipients and 24 male recipients (62.5% HeartMate II, 37.5% HeartWare) who received their devices between July 2007 and May 2013. Subjects were matched using propensity score analysis based on age, diagnosis, body surface area, preoperative mechanical circulatory support, heart failure severity score (INTERMACS class), and comorbidities. Female patients were significantly sicker before operation. After propensity score matching, there were no statistically significant differences in demographics or clinical baseline characteristics between male and female LVAD recipients. Also, there was a trend towards a longer postoperative intensive care unit stay in the female group (median 9 days [interquartile range 5-17] versus 15 days [interquartile range 8-33]; P < 0.061) and higher postoperative bilirubin values (median 14 mmol/L [interquartile range 10-17] versus 21 mmol/L [interquartile range 13-30]). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of outcome (P < 0.569). The overall survival was comparable between the two groups (log rank P < 0.389). Half (50%) of female patients required inotropic support for more than 7 days compared with 21.7% in the male group (P < 0.048). Half (50%) of female recipients required short-term postoperative right ventricular assist device implantation compared with 16.7% in the male group (P < 0.014). In conclusion, cfLVAD implantation as a bridge to transplantation is associated with longer duration of inotropic support and higher requirement for postoperative mechanical right ventricular support in women with similar survival rates. Further studies are required to identify additional demographic and clinical factors that modulate outcomes and will enhance the ability to risk-stratify cfLVAD recipients. "

Previous data suggest that the benefit of ICD therapy in real life may be lower than expected from the results of controlled studies and side-effects are not negligible. It is also unclear whether women benefit from treatment to the same extent as men. The aim of this study was to investigate the balance between benefits and complications of ICD therapy in a real-life population of patients with heart failure.We studied 865 consecutive patients with reduced LVEF treated with ICDs for primary prevention of SCD in 2006-11 in four tertiary care hospitals in Sweden (age 64 ± 11 years, 82% men, 62% ischaemic). The patients' medical records were scrutinized as regards appropriate therapies, complications related to the defibrillator, all-cause mortality, and gender differences. Mean follow-up was 35 ± 18 months. During follow-up 155 patients (18%) received appropriate ICD therapy, 61 patients (7%) had inappropriate shocks, 110 patients (13%) had at least one complication that required reoperation and 213 patients (25%) died. Men were twice as likely to receive ICD treatment compared with women (20 vs. 9%, P < 0.01), but neither total mortality nor complication rates differed.Ventricular arrhythmias necessitating ICD therapy are common (6% annually). Women are less likely to have correct ICD treatment, but have the same degree of treatment complications, thus reducing the net benefit of their treatment."

Despite advances in the treatment of HF over the past decade, incidence, morbidity and mortality for patients continue to rise while QoL declines. HF is common in African-Americans and women; however, there is limited research focusing on race and gender variables. Health related QoL, disease severity measured by B-type natriuretic peptide blood test (BNP) and ejection fraction (EF), and exercise tolerance measured by six minute walk test (6MWT) were assessed at admission and at 6 months in a convenience sample of 53 patients. Variables were compared by race and gender. The sample was 67.9% African American and 62.3% male. Men had greater improvements than women in QoL, BNP, and EF, while women had greater improvements in the 6MWT. African Americans had greater improvements than Whites in all four variables. Even in the presence of disease severity in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III and IV HF, there were significant improvements in QoL, BNP, HF outcomes demonstrating the importance of developing culturally sensitive and gender-specific treatment plans."

The syndrome of HF comes in two types: with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The latter is on the increase and predominantly present in women, especially the older ones. There is an urgent need for mortality-reducing drugs in HFpEF, a disease affecting around 5 % of those aged 65 years and over. HFpEF develops in patients with risk factors and comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, but also preeclampsia. These conditions are likely to drive microvascular disease with involvement of the coronary microvasculature, which may eventually evolve into HFpEF. Currently, the diagnosis of HFPEF relies mainly on echocardiography. There are no biomarkers that can help diagnose female microvascular disease or facilitate the diagnosis of (early stages of) HFpEF. Recently a Dutch consortium was initiated, Queen of Hearts, with support from the Netherlands Heart Foundation, with the aim to discover and validate biomarkers for diastolic dysfunction and HFpEF in women. These biomarkers come from innovative blood-derived sources such as extracellular vesicles and circulating cells. Within the Queen of Hearts consortium, we will pursue female biomarkers that have the potential for further evolution in assays with point of care capabilities. As a spin-off, the consortium will gain knowledge on gender-specific pathology of HFpEF, possibly opening up novel treatment options. "

Men developed heart failure earlier (7.0 vs. 8.6 years; P < 0.001). Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years in women compared to men were lower for HFrEF (1.2 vs. 3.0 %; P < 0.001), but higher for HFpEF (1.2 vs. 0.7 %; P < 0.001). Women developed HFpEF later in life than HFrEF (75.1 vs. 69.7 years; P = 0.033), while men showed no significant difference (72.2 vs. 69.5 years; P = 0.116). Multivariable competing risks analyses showed that women had lower risk for HFrEF (subhazard ratio = 0.47; 95 % CI 0.29-0.76, P = 0.002) but higher risk for HFpEF (subhazard ratio = 2.16; 95 % CI 1.21-3.83, P = 0.009) than men. Among all risk factors, only atrial fibrillation had a sex-specific predictive value and increased risk specifically for women (P-for interaction = 0.016).In a middle-aged population, men developed heart failure more frequently and at a younger age than women. However, women had higher risk for HFpEF, with atrial fibrillation being a specific female risk factor."

Etiological and pathophysiological differences may result in different outcomes in response to this treatment by sex. The observed disproportionate representation of women suggests that many women with heart failure either do not meet current clinical criteria to receive CRT in trials or are not properly recruited and maintained in these studies.We performed a systematic literature review through May 2014 of clinical trials and registries of CRT use that stratified outcomes by sex or reported percent women included. One-hundred eighty-three studies contained sex-specific information.Ninety percent of the studies evaluated included ≤ 35% women. Fifty-six articles included effectiveness data that reported response with regard to specific outcome parameters. When compared with men, women exhibited more dramatic improvement in specific parameters. In the studies reporting hazard ratios for hospitalization or death, women generally had greater benefit from CRT.Our review confirms women are markedly underrepresented in CRT trials, and when a CRT device is implanted, women have a therapeutic response that is equivalent to or better than in men, while there is no difference in adverse events reported by sex."

When women and men with HF are compared, there are significant differences in disease etiology, expression, outcomes, and perhaps, response to therapy. Hypertension rather than coronary artery disease is a more important etiology of HF in women, and HF with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFPEF) is more common in women. Regardless of its etiology, women have better survival and less sudden cardiac death, but poorer quality of life with equivalent degrees of left ventricular dysfunction. Animal studies of myocardial response to stressors resulting in heart failure corroborate sex differences in ventricular remodeling, cellular morphology, and function. Despite the fact that women make up nearly 50 % of HF patients, their inclusion in randomized clinical trials has remained at about 20 %, with no trials including women as a prespecified subgroup for statistical analysis. Thus, the evidence base for treatment of HF in women is not robustly supported by sex-specific data."

Death from any cause constituted the endpoint of the study. NT-proBNP was measured and HFSS calculated according to standard methods. Survival of men and women according to level of NT-proBNP and HFSS was analyzed in logistic regression models.Median NT-proBNP level in men was 1,394 ng/l (IQR 516-3,406 ng/l) and 1,168 ng/l (IQR 444-2,830 ng/l) in women (p = n.s.). Median HFSS value was 8.4 (IQR 7.7-9.1) and 8.5 (8.0-9.1) in men and women, respectively. NT-proBNP levels and HFSS score correlated well with survival rates in both genders (p for interaction = 0.22 for NT-proBNP and 0.93 for HFSS). The all-cause death rates were similar in men and women.Despite a number of gender-specific differences in CHF and the general predominance of men measured levels of NT-proBNP and HFSS score can be utilized for risk stratification with similar informative value in men and women."

In primary care, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is used for excluding heart failure. The Dutch and European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines apply two BNP cut-off levels without making distinction for gender and age. The aim of our study was to establish BNP reference ranges for use in primary care.We investigated BNP values of 9447 eligible subjects in a primary care laboratory. For establishing the reference ranges in various age and gender classes we used the Bhattacharya method.Analysis of variance demonstrated that BNP data were significantly dependent on age and gender (p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively), with the age effect being the strongest. Further, we found that the reference ranges were significantly higher than the cut-off values used in the heart failure guidelines, particularly in elderly subjects. For example, the proportion of individuals with a BNP value higher than the 29 pmol/L cut-off increased from approximately 5% in the youngest group to no less than about 50% in the oldest subjects.BNP reference ranges need to be age- and gender-specific. When applying a single cut-off, many healthy subjects, especially the elderly, would be falsely diagnosed as having elevated BNP, and referred for further unnecessary diagnostics."

However, the molecular factors underlying sex differences in LV remodelling are incompletely understood. We took an unbiased approach to identify sex-specific patterns in gene expression and pathway regulation, and confirmed the most prominent findings in human hearts.Echocardiography was performed in 104 patients (53.8% women) with aortic stenosis before aortic valve replacement. LV mass, LV end-diastolic diameter, and relative wall thickness were included in a factor analysis to generate an index classifying LV remodelling as adaptive or maladaptive. Maladaptive remodelling was present in 64.6% of male and in 32.7% of female patients (P < 0.01). Genome-wide expression profiling of LV samples was performed in a representative subgroup of 19 patients (52.6% women) compared with samples from healthy controls (n = 18). Transcriptome characterization revealed that fibrosis-related genes/pathways were induced in male overloaded ventricles, while extracellular matrix-related and inflammatory genes/pathways were repressed in female overloaded ventricles (adjusted P < 0.05). We confirmed gene regulation by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting analysis, and we further demonstrate the relevance of our findings by histological documentation of higher fibrosis in men than in women.We conclude that in pressure overload distinct molecular processes are regulated between men and women. Maladaptive LV remodelling occurs more frequently in men and is associated with greater activation of profibrotic and inflammatory markers. Collectively, sex-specific regulation of these processes may contribute to sex differences in the progression to heart failure."

The chart-level data were collected that would indicate guideline eligibility and nonadherence.A total of 762 patients with HF were included (mean age 66 years; 527 (69%) were males; median left ventricular ejection fraction 33%). Over follow-up, 331 patients (43%) were never guideline eligible whereas 431 (57%) were guideline eligible for a device. Yearly rates for ICD and CRT adherence in ""guideline-eligible"" patients ranged from 59% to 68% and from 66% to 81%, respectively. ""Patient preference"" was the most commonly documented reason for guideline nonadherence in eligible patients. After removal of patients with reasons for nonadherence, rates of ICD and CRT adherence in the ""truly eligible"" patients were found to be higher (70%-81% and 71%-88%, respectively) than those in guideline-eligible patients. Independent predictors of device nonadherence in truly eligible patients were age >75 years, QRS duration <120 ms, left ventricular ejection fraction <30%, and female sex.Based on chart-level data, utilization rates of device-based therapies in patients with HF appear much higher than those of prior registry-based estimates. Given the importance of patient preferences for lack of device use, future quality-of-care metrics based on guideline adherence should capture detailed chart-level data and patient preferences."

We assessed sex-based differences in baseline clinical characteristics and measures of cardiovascular structure/function. Coronary artery disease was less common in women than in men. Women were more obese and symptomatic, and less likely to have albuminuria. Women had higher indexed left ventricular (LV) wall thicknesses, worse diastolic function (lower E', P = 0.002; higher E/E', P < 0.001), while LV mass and LV volumes indexed for height(2.7) were similar. Nonetheless, female sex was associated with a trend towards higher prevalence of abnormal LV geometry (defined as concentric hypertrophy, or eccentric hypertrophy, or concentric remodelling) at baseline (unadjusted P = 0.028, adjusted P = 0.056) and 12 weeks' follow up (unadjusted P = 0.001, adjusted P = 0.006), but not at 36 weeks' follow up (unadjusted P = 0.81, adjusted P = 0.99).

Height and weight were used to compute BMI. A neuropsychology battery tested global cognitive function, memory, attention, and executive function. Composites were created using averages of age-adjusted scaled scores. Regressions adjusting for demographic and medical factors were conducted. The sample was predominantly overweight/obese (76.2%). For men, greater BMI predicted poorer attention (ΔR(2) = 0.03; β = -0.18; P = .01) and executive function (ΔR(2) = 0.02; β = -0.13; P = .04); these effects were largely driven by men with severe obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m(2)). BMI did not predict memory (P = .69) or global cognitive functioning (P = .08). In women, greater BMI was not associated with any cognitive variable (all P ≥ .09).Higher BMI was associated with poorer attention and executive function in male HF patients, especially those with severe obesity.

Despite promising results in males, the efficacy of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil in female cardiac pathologies has not been determined and might be affected by estrogen levels, given the hormone's involvement in cGMP synthesis. Here, we determined that the heart-protective effect of sildenafil in female mice depends on the presence of estrogen via a mechanism that involves myocyte eNOS-dependent cGMP synthesis and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα (PKGIα). Sildenafil treatment failed to exert antiremodeling properties in female pathological hearts from Gαq-overexpressing or pressure-overloaded mice after ovary removal; however, estrogen replacement restored the effectiveness of sildenafil in these animals. In females, sildenafil-elicited myocardial PKG activity required estrogen, which stimulated tonic cardiomyocyte cGMP synthesis via an eNOS/soluble guanylate cyclase pathway. In contrast, eNOS activation, cGMP synthesis, and sildenafil efficacy were not estrogen dependent in male hearts. Estrogen and sildenafil had no impact on pressure-overloaded hearts from animals expressing dysfunctional PKGIα, indicating that PKGIα mediates antiremodeling effects. These results support the importance of sex differences in the use of PDE5 inhibitors for treating heart disease and the critical role of estrogen status when these agents are used in females. "

The renin-angiotensin system mediates cardiac pathology in heart failure. This study investigated the sexually dimorphic functional effects of ageing combined with angiotensin II (AngII) on cardiac muscle cell function, twitch and Ca(2+)-handling characteristics of isolated cardiomyocytes from young (~13 weeks) and aged (~87 weeks) adult wild type (WT) and AngII-transgenic (TG) mice. We hypothesised that AngII-induced contractile impairment would be exacerbated in aged female cardiomyocytes and linked to Ca(2+)-handling disturbances. AngII-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was evident in young adult mice of both sexes and accentuated by age (aged adult ~21-23 % increases in cell length relative to WT). In female AngII-TG mice, ageing was associated with suppressed cardiomyocyte contractility (% shortening, maximum rate of shortening, maximum rate of relaxation). This was associated with delayed cytosolic Ca(2+) removal during twitch relaxation (Tau ~20 % increase relative to young adult female WT), and myofilament responsiveness to Ca(2+) was maintained. In contrast, aged AngII-TG male cardiomyocytes exhibited peak shortening equivalent to young TG; yet, myofilament Ca(2+) responsiveness was profoundly reduced with ageing. Increased pro-arrhythmogenic spontaneous activity was evident with age and cardiac AngII overexpression in male mice (42-55 % of myocytes) but relatively suppressed in female aged transgenic mice. Female myocytes with elevated AngII appear more susceptible to an age-related contractile deficit, whereas male AngII-TG myocytes preserve contractile function with age but exhibit desensitisation of myofilaments to Ca(2+) and a heightened vulnerability to arrhythmic activity. These findings support the contention that sex-specific therapies are required for the treatment of age-progressive heart failure."

Consecutively, the association of BNP levels above these 90th percentiles with subsequent cardiovascular and coronary events was assessed in the entire cohort.In the BNP-normal sub-sample (n = 1,639), we defined gender-specific 90th percentile of BNP (31.3 pg/ml for men, 45.5 pg/ml for women). From overall 3,697 subjects (mean age 59.4, 52.4 % female), 194 subjects developed a major cardiovascular event and 122 myocardial infarction during a mean follow-up period of 8.0 ± 1.5 years.

Our aim was to investigate sex- and ERβ-specific effects in protein abundance in PO employing a 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis/mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach. We hypothesized major sex differences and ERβ-specific alterations consistent with cardioprotection in females. Two-month old male and female wild-type (WT) and ERβ knockout (BERKO) mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 9 weeks (n = 4/group). In WT mice, hypertrophy was significantly more pronounced in males than females, while this sex difference was abolished in BERKO mice. We found 82 protein spots modulated between TAC and sham in WT males, 31 in WT females, 114 in BERKO males, and 87 in BERKO females (P ≤ 0.05). Our analysis revealed in WT and BERKO females an altered pattern of various proteins involved in structure and suggests a link between female sex and cytoskeletal integrity. In males, a set of proteins was identified that associate with mitochondrial bioenergetics and energy supply. We confirmed protein regulation by immunoblotting analysis. In conclusion, the proteomic response of the heart to PO is significantly modulated by ERβ and sex. We put forward that the observed differences may identify sex-specific targets for the treatment of heart failure, contributing toward more personalized medical care. "

The expression of the isoform that is associated with more rapid contraction kinetics and greater power output, MHC-α, is downregulated, with a concurrent increase in the relative amount of the slower isoform, MHC-β, during the progression to experimentally induced or disease-related heart failure. This change in protein expression has been well studied in right and left ventricles in heart failure models and in humans with failure. Relatively little quantitative data exists regarding MHC isoform expression shifts in human failing atria. We previously reported significant increases in the relative amount of MHC-β in the human failing left atrium. The results of that study suggested that there might be a sex-related difference in the level of MHC-β in the left atrium, but the number of female subjects was insufficient for statistical analysis. The objective of this study was to test whether there is, in fact, a sex-related difference in the level of MHC-β in the right and left atria of humans with cardiomyopathy. The results indicate that significant differences exist in atrial MHC isoform expression between men and women who are in failure. The results also revealed an unexpected twofold greater amount of MHC-β in the nonfailing left atrium of women, compared with men. The observed sex-related differences in MHC isoform expression could impact ventricular diastolic filling during normal daily activities, as well as during physiologically stressful events. "

Functional and dimensional parameters measurement using echocardiography revealed diastolic dysfunction in female diabetic mice within 8 weeks after STZ-induced diabetes. This was associated with significant downregulation of pro-survival Pim-1 and upregulation of pro-apoptotic Caspase-3, microRNA-1 and microRNA-208a. Male diabetic mice did not show any significant changes at this time point (P < 0.05 vs. female diabetic). Further, the onset of ventricular remodelling was quicker in female diabetic mice showing marked left ventricular dilation, reduced ejection fraction and poor contractility (P < 0.05 vs. male diabetic at 12 and 16 weeks of STZ-induced diabetes). Molecular analysis of samples from human diabetic hearts confirmed the results of pre-clinical studies, showing marked downregulation of Pim-1 in the female diabetic heart (P < 0.05 vs. male diabetic). Finally, in vitro restoration of Pim-1 reversed the female disadvantage in diabetic cardiomyocytes.We provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms behind the rapid onset of cardiomyopathy in female diabetics.

These effects were abolished in ERβ-deficient mice. We demonstrate the presence of common functional target sites for these miRNAs on three repressors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, i.e. Rasa1, Rasa2 and Spry1, which may all lead to cardiac fibrosis. As expected, transfection with miRNA mimics targeting these repressors induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation.Estrogen regulates a network of miRNAs in a sex-specific manner via ERβ.

Cardiac function was measured by determining the ratio of early-diastolic peak flow velocity (E) and late-diastolic peak flow velocity (A), as well as the deceleration time of the early mitral velocity (MV-DT). Cardiac dysfunction was defined as E/A values <25th percentile (E/A <0.78 for men and <0.79 for women), left atrial volume (LAV) values >75th percentile (LAV >34.9 mL for men and >32.2 mL for women), and MV-DT values >75th percentile (MV-DT >210 ms for men and >195 ms for women). CIMT, E/A, LAV, and MV-DT were significantly correlated with age in both men (CIMT: r = 0.418, P < .01; E/A: r = -0.325, P < .01, LAV: r = 0.123, P < .05; MV-DT: r = 0.175, P < .01) and women (CIMT: r = 0.429, P < .01; E/A: r = -0.423, P < .01; LAV: r = 0.180, P < .01; MV-DT: r = 0.174, P < .01). Interestingly, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was not significantly correlated with age in either gender. CIMT was significantly associated with a lower E/A in an unadjusted model in tertiles II and III. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) for men were 2.428 (1.36-4.335) and 3.017 (1.674-5.437), respectively. However, this association disappeared with age adjustment. The odds ratios (95% CI) for women were 3.298 (1.742-6.246) and 6.002 (3.202-11.251), respectively, and these were still significant after adjustments for all other variables, including age, blood pressure, blood lipid, and inflammatory markers (tertile II: 3.031, 95% CI 1.228-7.48; tertile III: 3.224, 95% CI 1.308-7.946). A higher MV-DT was significantly correlated with higher CIMT only in an unadjusted model for women, and this association was lost with age adjustment. There was no significant association between CIMT and higher LAV values.Age-related increases in CIMT were correlated with a decline in cardiac diastolic function only in women, which may contribute to the higher incidence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction."

Gender has significant effects on the pathophysiology of HF. Low levels of free testosterone are independently associated with increased chronic HF symptoms and mortality. Cardiac fibrosis plays a pivotal role in structural remodeling in HF. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, angiotensin II and oxidative stress contribute to the activity/extent of cardiac fibrosis. Androgen deficiency can up-regulate TGF-β expression under angiotensin II stimulation in vivo. In this review, we summarized the potential mechanisms accounting for the effects of androgen on cardiac fibrosis through regulating fibrocytes activity under TGF, which can explain wound healing and cardiac fibrosis in male with acute myocardial injury and chronic HF."

These charts were from Saudi patients who were diagnosed with HF, with and without subsequent stroke. Demographics, HF characteristics, stroke risk factors, and metabolic characteristics were noted and analyzed.No difference was observed in HF characteristics and stroke risk factors among HF patients with and without subsequent stroke. In terms of metabolic profile, those who had stroke had significantly higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL)--cholesterol levels as compared to those without (P=.03). Stratification to gender and adjusting for age and risk factors revealed that significantly higher LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol levels were observed in female stroke patients (P values .02, .028, respectively) and significantly higher blood urea nitrogen levels were observed in male stroke patients (P=.04) as compared to their counterparts who never had a stroke.The gender differences in the metabolic presentation of Saudi HF patients with stroke warrant further clinical investigation. Atherogenic dyslipidemia and renal insufficiency are suggested to be early predic.tors for stroke and should be closely monitored in Saudi HF patients."

Female gender, age, left ventricular ejection fraction, peak VO2, peak systolic blood pressure, and beta-blocker treatment all contributed to increase the risk ability of the hierarchical multivariate model. Two-year survival was higher in women: 85 vs 66%; χ(2)=15.7, p<0.0001. Peculiarly, outcome results were similar when only CVD was considered. Females showed a multivariate adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.46. Since a 1-mL/kg/min increment in peak VO2 was equated with a 12% improvement in prognosis, the same gender adjusted HR was achieved when mean peak VO2 was reduced by 5 units in women: thus, a HF woman with peak VO2 of 9 mL/kg/min has the same 2-year outcome as a HF man with peak VO2 of 14 mL/kg/min.Although HF women have a comparatively lower peak VO2 than men, they live longer. We discovered that the traditional cut point value for peak VO2, i.e. ≤ 14 mL/kg/min is not a ""gender-neutral"" reference since lumping HF men and women together with the same VO2 value is unlikely to describe the true risk. These preliminary findings do underline the need to assimilate gender-specific issues into clinical practice in HF, when appropriate."

A comparative analysis of clinical and echocardiographic findings was performed between 5228 males and 4107 females. Patients were followed for a mean of 2.8 ± 2.6 years. Females compared with males had less ischaemic heart disease, prior stroke, chronic renal failure, and COPD, and higher rates of hypertension, AF, obesity, valvular abnormalities, and pulmonary hypertension. Unadjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were higher among women, while age-adjusted rates were similar. Predictors of outcomes varied between genders. Female-specific predictors of mortality included aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, and malignancy, whereas diastolic dysfunction and chronic renal failure were found to be male-specific predictors.Age-adjusted mortality rates of male and female hospitalized HF patients are similarly high.

Aortic characteristic impedance (Z(c)), total arterial compliance (pulsatile load), and systemic vascular resistance index (steady load) were compared between men and women, and sex-specific multivariable regression analyses were performed to assess associations of these arterial parameters with diastolic dysfunction and ventricular-arterial coupling (effective arterial elastance/left ventricular end-systolic elastance [Ea/Ees]) after adjustment for potential confounders.Z(c) was higher and total arterial compliance was lower in women, whereas systemic vascular resistance index was similar between sexes. In women but not men, higher log Z(c) was associated with mitral inflow E/A ratio (β ± SE: -0.17 ± 0.07), diastolic dysfunction (odds ratio: 7.8; 95% confidence interval: 2.0 to 30.2) and Ea/Ees (β ± SE: 0.13 ± 0.04) (p ≤ 0.01 for all). Similarly, total arterial compliance was associated with E/A ratio (β ± SE: 0.12 ± 0.04), diastolic dysfunction (odds ratio: 0.33; 95% confidence interval: 0.12 to 0.89), and Ea/Ees (β ± SE: -0.09 ± 0.03) in women only (p ≤ 0.03 for all). Systemic vascular resistance index was not associated with diastolic dysfunction or Ea/Ees.Proximal aortic stiffness (Z(c)) is greater in women than men, and women may be more susceptible to the deleterious effects of greater pulsatile and early arterial load on diastolic function and ventricular-arterial interaction.

Italian data from institutional databases of the Lazio, Basilicata and Veneto regions are in agreement with international evidences on this topic. Gender differences in clinical phenotypes are based on different structural and functional patterns: the female heart undergoes more often concentric remodeling, with thicker walls, smaller volumes and greater chamber stiffness.

After adjustment for potential confounders, ICD use increased significantly in the overall study population during 2005 to 2007 (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.48 per year; P=0.0008) and in black women (odds ratio, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.58 per year; P=0.0008), white women (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.59 per year; P=0.010), black men (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.99 per year; P=0.0009), and white men (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.48 per year; P=0.0072). The increase in ICD use was greatest among blacks.In the GWTG-HF quality improvement program, a significant increase in ICD therapy use was observed over time in all sex and race groups. The previously described racial disparities in ICD use were no longer present by the end of the study period; however, sex differences persisted."

We sought to evaluate sex/EF differences in mortality and risk factors for survival in hospitalized patients with HF.We included hospitals fully participating in Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure that admitted HF patients with reduced (EF <40%) or preserved (EF ≥50%) EF. The primary end point was in-hospital mortality. Multivariate generalized estimating equation logistic models were used to compute odds ratios accounting for hospital clustering.The study cohort consisted of 51,428 patients with EF <40% (36% women, 64% men) and 37,699 patients with EF ≥50% (65% women, 35% men). Women compared with men with reduced and preserved EF were older and more likely to have hypertension, depression, or valvular heart disease and less likely to have coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease. There were no sex differences in in-hospital mortality (EF <40%, 2.69% women vs 2.89% men, P = .20; EF ≥50%, 2.61% women vs 2.62% men, P = .96), and risk factors such as age, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and history of renal failure/dialysis were highly predictive of death for each sex/EF subgroup.In a large, multicenter registry, we found that despite differences in baseline characteristics, women and men with reduced and preserved EF have similar in-hospital mortality and risk factors predicting death."

The database included 4 153 patients hospitalised for acute heart failure in the period 2006-2009. 2 384 patients had a complete record of their total cholesterol levels. 946 females and 1437 males were included in this analysis. According to the admission total cholesterol levels, patients were divided into 5 groups: < 4.50 mmol/l (group A), 4.50-4.99 mmol/l (group B), 5.0-5.49 mmol/l (group C), 5.50-5.99 mmol/l (group D) and > 6.0 mmol/l (group E). The median total cholesterol levels were 4.24 in males and 4.60 in females (P<0.001). There were differences in the distribution of total cholesterol levels between men and women: group A 57.6 vs 45.0%, group B 13.8 vs 16.3%, group C 9.8 vs 12.5%, group D 7.7 vs 11.4%, group E 11.1 vs 14.8% respectively (all P<0.001).

For the calculation of long term mortality, the cohort was divided into three groups: total cholesterol levels below 4.50 mmol/l, 4.50-5.49 mmol/l and above 5.50 mmol/l. The log rank test was used for the analysis.There were no differences in hospital mortality between male and female in general (9.2 vs 10.8%, P<0.202), or in total cholesterol levels in subgroups. Total cholesterol levels were associated with in-hospital mortality (P<0.002). In the long-term follow up (78 months) patients with total cholesterol levels below 4.5 mmol/l had the worst prognosis (P<0.001). An independent influence of total cholesterol level on mortality and survival was confirmed in the multivariate model as well.Women with acute heart failure had higher total cholesterol levels than men in all ages. There was a higher percentage of women with total cholesterol levels above 6 mmol/l and lower percentage in the group below 4.5 mmol/l than in men. In all, total cholesterol categories women were older than men. Total cholesterol levels are important for in- hospital mortality and long term survival of patients admitted for acute heart failure."

We review these gaps and explore a biological basis for varying outcomes. Endogenous estrogen plays an important role in epidemiology and outcome. The administration of exogenous estrogen has had varied success in treatment and is outlined extensively below. Additionally, we highlight unique HF syndromes through pregnancy and important sex-specific issues concerning transplant and mechanical circulatory support.

With the experience of 1,607 VAD implantations in our institution we are the first to analyze our data to determine gender distribution in our patient populations and the effect of gender on outcomes. Of the total 1,456 patients with MCS, 1,225 were male and 231 female. The patients were divided into three age groups-below 13 years (group 1, n = 100), between 13 and 50 years (group 2, n = 540) and older than 50 years (group 3, n = 824). Five-year survival, HF etiology, and procedural success, defined as 30-day and 5-year survival were analyzed retrospectively. In group 1 the gender distribution was equal; the leading HF etiology was dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP) with 17% in male (n = 17) and 19% in female (n = 19) patients, followed by congenital diseases (13% in male versus 9% in female) and postcardiotomy failure (13% in male versus 8% in female). No differences were seen in 5-year survival and procedural success. In group 2, significantly more men (n = 451, p < 0.0001) were supported by VADs. DCMP was the major cause for VAD implantation (54%) and was significantly more frequent in men (57.6%, p = <0.0001). Male patients were older (mean age = 37.1 years, p < 0.0001), with a longer median support time (151.6 days, p < 0.0001) and a higher median weight (78.2 kg, p < 0.0001). No difference was seen in procedural success whereas 5-year survival was better in men than in women (53% vs. 42%, p = 0.02).Group 3 consisted of 723 male patients and 101 female patients (p < 0.0001). Ischemic cardiomyopathy was the main HF etiology (37.9 %) and it was significantly more often the reason for left ventricular assist device support in men (p = 0.009). No differences were seen in procedural success; 5-year survival showed a better outcome in men (49% vs. 25%, p = 0.026). In patients supported by a VAD, gender has a significant impact on the distribution of diagnoses in the adult population. Women were underrepresented in the age group 13-50 years, and 50 years and older, and women had a higher risk for mortality on VAD support in the adult age groups (groups 2 and 3)."

We have previously shown that the cardioprotective effects of adrenomedullin (AM), an emerging clinical biomarker for cardiovascular disease severity, vary with sex in mouse models. AM signaling during cardiovascular stress is strongly modulated by receptor activity-modifying protein 3 (RAMP3) via its interaction with the G protein-coupled receptor calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR). Like AM, RAMP3 expression is potently regulated by estrogen, and so we sought to determine the consequences of genetic Ramp3 loss on cardiac adaptation to chronic hypertension, with a particular focus on characterizing potential sex differences. We generated and bred RAMP3(-/-) mice to RenTgMK mice that consistently display severe angiotensin II-mediated CV disease and compared CV disease progression in RenTgMK to that of RenTgMK:RAMP3(-/-) offspring. As expected, RAMP3 gene expression was higher in cardiovascular tissues of RenTgMK mice and more strongly up-regulated in female RenTgMK mice relative to wildtype controls. RAMP3 loss did not affect the development of hypertension or the presence and severity of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis in the left ventricle (LV). However, echocardiography revealed that while RenTgMK mice developed concentric cardiac hypertrophy with sustained systolic function, male RenTgMK:RAMP3(-/-) mice showed evidence of LV chamber dilatation and depressed systolic function, suggestive of cardiac decompensation. Consistent with these measures of heart failure, male RenTgMK:RAMP3(-/-) mice had increased cardiac apoptosis and elevated activation of Akt. These phenotypes were not present in female RenTgMK:RAMP3(-/-) mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate a sex-dependant, cardioprotective role of RAMP3 in the setting of chronic hypertension."

In response to acute coronary ischemia, women are relatively protected from apoptosis, and experience less adverse cardiac remodeling than men, frequently resulting in preservation of left ventricular size and ejection fraction. Despite these advantages, women are at increased risk for HF- complicating acute MI when compared with men. However, women with HF retain a survival advantage over men with HF, including a decreased risk of sudden death. Sex-specific treatment of HF has been hindered by historical under-representation of women in clinical trials, though recent work has suggested that women may have a differential response to some therapies such as cardiac resynchronization.

It is unclear whether women, who have higher frequency of HFNEF, are more vulnerable than men to the deleterious effects of arterial stiffness on LV diastolic function. We investigated, in a large community-based cohort, whether sex differences exist in the relationship among arterial stiffness, wave reflection, and LV diastolic function. Arterial stiffness and wave reflection were assessed in 983 participants from the Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions study using applanation tonometry. The central pulse pressure/stroke volume index, total arterial compliance, pulse pressure amplification, and augmentation index were used as parameters of arterial stiffness and wave reflection. LV diastolic function was evaluated by 2-dimensional echocardiography and tissue-Doppler imaging. Arterial stiffness and wave reflection were greater in women compared with men, independent of body size and heart rate (all P<0.01), and showed inverse relationships with parameters of diastolic function in both sexes. Further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors attenuated these relationships; however, a higher central pulse pressure/stroke volume index predicted LV diastolic dysfunction in women (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence intervals, 1.03 to 2.30) and men (odds ratio, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 3.39), independent of other risk factors. In conclusion, in our community-based cohort study, higher arterial stiffness was associated with worse LV diastolic function in men and women. Women's higher arterial stiffness, independent of body size, may contribute to their greater susceptibility to develop HFNEF."

In women, heart failure is associated with a higher frequency of hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopathy and left bundle branch block than in men. Subgroup analyses of data from randomized clinical trials suggest that these differences result in a differential response to heart failure therapies, including a somewhat better response to β-blockers, a worse prognosis with digoxin therapy, and a lower survival benefit with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in women. Importantly, female patients with heart failure also derive significantly greater improvements in cardiac volumes from cardiac resynchronization therapy than do male patients, and this treatment is associated with reduced risks of all-cause mortality and heart failure events among women with mild symptoms. These data suggest that sex-related differences might exist in response to both medical and device therapies for patients with heart failure."

The aim of this study was to assess the typical profile, trajectory and resource use of a cohort of Australian patients with heart failure using linked population-based, patient-level data.Using hospital separations (Admitted Patient Data Collection) with death registrations (Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages) for the period 2000-2007 we estimated age- and gender-specific rates of index admissions and readmissions, risk factors for hospital readmission, mean length of stay (LOS), median survival and bed-days occupied by patients with heart failure in New South Wales, Australia.We identified 29,161 index admissions for heart failure. Admission rates increased with age, and were higher for males than females for all age groups. Age-standardised rates decreased over time (256.7 to 237.7/100,000 for males and 235.3 to 217.1/100,000 for females from 2002-3 to 2006-7; p = 0.0073 adjusted for gender). Readmission rates (any cause) were 27% and 73% at 28-days and one year respectively; readmission rates for heart failure were 11% and 32% respectively. All cause mortality was 10% and 28% at 28 days and one year. Increasing age was associated with more heart failure readmissions, longer LOS and shorter median survival. Increasing age, increasing Charlson comorbidity score and male gender were risk factors for hospital readmission. Cohort members occupied 954,888 hospital bed-days during the study period (any cause); 383,646 bed-days were attributed to heart failure admissions.The rates of index admissions for heart failure decreased significantly in both males and females over the study period. However, the impact on acute care hospital beds was substantial, with heart failure patients occupying almost 200,000 bed-days per year in NSW over the five year study period. The strong age-related trends highlight the importance of stabilising elderly patients before discharge and community-based outreach programs to better manage heart failure and reduce readmissions."

Participants completed baseline and 12-month questionnaires containing clinical and demographic descriptive information and validated self-report measures of: (1) physical functioning (Medical Outcome Study [MOS] SF12 and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ]) and (2) social support (MOS- Social Support Survey). Women were more likely to be single, widowed or divorced, living alone and earning less annual income. At baseline, women reported significantly lower support and physical function scores. However, at 1 year there were no significant gender differences in the proportion of men or women who experienced clinically meaningful functional decline or death across the year of follow-up. In multivariable modeling, men with lower levels of social support were more likely to experience functional decline. This was not the case for women. Our findings suggest that gender-directed strategies to promote optimization of function for both men and women living with HF in their community are warranted."

Of these, 1416 patients aged ≥65 years were grouped into four subgroups according to age. Predictors of β-blocker use were determined using logistic regression analyses. Comparisons between younger adults and older patients were conducted using Student's t-tests and chi-squared (χ2) tests.Up to 47% of older patients were not receiving β-blockers, and this percentage progressively increased with age, with the oldest patients showing the lowest rate of utilization. No gender difference in the pattern of use of β-blockers was noted. The prescription of β-blockers was higher in patients with heart failure (HF) than in patients without HF. The presence of HF abolished the decrease in β-blocker use with age. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that lower age and severe HF were independent predictors of β-blocker use in older people.Age appears to be a key factor in the under-prescription of β-blockers in CAD outpatients. Despite the recommendations, and the efforts of cardiologists, the use of β-blockers in the elderly is still limited, possibly because of practical constraints such as adverse effects and co-morbidity. In patients with HF, age is less important in determining the use of β-blockers."

We determined WC and fasting TG levels and the cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus in 2,279 men and 875 postmenopausal women who were routinely referred to coronary angiography. The LAP was calculated as (WC (cm)--65) × (TG (mmol/l)) for men and as (WC (cm)--58) × (TG (mmol/l)) for women. LAP levels were independently associated with congestive heart failure mortality in all postmenopausal women and with all-cause mortality in diabetic postmenopausal women but not in men. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for all-cause, cardiovascular, and congestive heart failure mortality in the third compared to the first LAP tertile were 4.28 (1.94-9.44; P < 0.001), 3.47 (1.28-9.40; P = 0.015), and 10.77 (1.21-95.88; P = 0.033), respectively, in normal weight postmenopausal women, whereas no significant associations were found in men. LAP levels were highly associated with type 2 diabetes in all subjects, postmenopausal women, and men. High LAP values are predictive of mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors in normal weight and diabetic postmenopausal women but not in men. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) was highly associated with LAP in women and men. Our study validates an inexpensive and simple risk profiling that may allow identifying postmenopausal women at high cardiovascular risk."

Treatment effects on physiologic outcome parameters and on symptoms were analysed for their association with baseline severity and gender. Changes in symptom scores were investigated with respect to their relation to physiologic outcome parameters. Results were compared with observations in a 3-year cohort study.Physiologic outcome parameters maximal workload (MWL), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and pressure-heart rate product increase (PHRPI) at 50 W ergometric exercise improved more in active treatment than in placebo patients. Magnitude of improvement was independent from baseline for LVEF but increased for MWL and PHRPI with baseline severity. Improvement of typical symptoms like reduced exercise tolerance, exertional dyspnea, weakness, fatigue, and palpitations improved more with active treatment and in patients with more severe symptoms. A weak association between improvements in MWL, PRHP, and symptoms could be demonstrated. Gender differences in treatment effects could be explained by baseline differences. Results of the pooled analysis are in agreement with observations in the cohort study.Crataegus extract treatment effects on physiologic outcomes and typical symptoms were modulated by baseline severity. Taking baseline differences into account, benefits were comparable in male and female patients with impaired exercise-tolerance in early chronic heart-failure."

It is also involved in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF). Here, we investigated the effects of FKBP12.6 over-expression and gender on Ca(2+)-handling proteins (RyR2, SERCA2a/PLB, and NCX), and on pro-(CaMKII, Cn/NFAT) and anti-hypertrophic (GSK3β) signalling pathways in a thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) mouse model. Wild type mice (WT) and mice over-expressing FKBP12.6 of both genders underwent TAC or sham-operation (Sham). FKBP12.6 over-expression ameliorated post-TAC survival rates in both genders. Over time, FKBP12.6 over-expression reduced the molecular signature of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and the transition to HF (BNP and β-MHC mRNAs) and attenuated Cn/NFAT activation in TAC-males only. The gender difference in pro- and anti-hypertrophic LVH signals was time-dependent: TAC-females exhibited earlier pathological LVH associated with concomitant SERCA2a down-regulation, CaMKII activation, and GSK3β inactivation. Both genotypes showed systolic dysfunction, possibly related to down-regulated RyR2, but only FK-TAC-males exhibited preserved diastolic LV function. Although FKBP12.6 over-expression did not impact the vicious cycle of TAC-induced HF, this study reveals some subtle sequential and temporal gender differences in Ca(2+)-signalling pathways of pathological LVH."

These changes lead to diastolic and systolic dysfunction and impaired reserve capacity. Many of the cardiovascular alterations seen in HFpEF are also noted to greater extent in women compared with men. Women demonstrate more concentric left ventricular remodeling and less ventricular dilatation in response to arterial hypertension. Ventricular and arterial stiffness increases with age in both sexes, but the increase is more dramatic in women. Recently, age-sex interactions have also been observed in the manner in which left ventricular function changes across the lifespan, wherein systolic and diastolic function and functional reserve become more compromised in women as compared with men in the postmenopausal years, despite similar or enhanced function in women during youth.The prevalence of HFpEF is increasing and women outnumber men by a 2 : 1 ratio. Recent data have identified striking parallels between structure-function alterations observed in HFpEF and sex differences in cardiovascular function across the adult lifespan. These data suggest that sex-specific maladaptations to hypertensive aging in women may underlie greater risk of HFpEF."

The prevalence of hypothyroidism was 18% for all patients with HF and 23% among Hispanics; however, this trend was not statistically significant (P = .06). More men than women had hypothyroidism (P = .04). Patients with hypothyroidism had higher mean lipid profiles (P < .01) and lower mean heart rates (P = .03) than healthy patients. Hypothyroidism is prevalent among HF patients, especially men. Hispanics with HF may have a higher prevalence of hypothyroidism. The standardized protocol of the HFDMP helped identify new cases of hypothyroidism."

The aim of this study was to determine the age and gender dependency of LV mechanical indices obtained from real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE).RT3DE was performed in 280 healthy subjects (age range, 1-88 years; 137 men). From full-volume data sets, LV endocardial and epicardial borders were semiautomatically traced using quantitative software. LV volumes and corresponding long-axis diameter were measured throughout the cardiac cycle. Sphericity index was defined as the ratio of LV volume and spherical volume, calculated as 4/3 × π × (long-axis diameter/2)(3). LV mass was calculated as (LV epicardial volume - LV endocardial volume) × 1.05. The ratio of LV mass to LV volume was also calculated.The mean value of LV ejection fraction did not change with age. However, LV volumes, mass, sphericity index, and LV mass/volume ratio were altered by age: (1) sphericity index was highest in the first decade of age and then declined until the fifth decade, (2) LV mass/volume ratio significantly increased in older age, and (3) LV mass/volume ratio was significantly higher in aged women compared with age-matched men.Age has heterogeneous effects on LV shape and LV mass/volume ratio, potentially due to the growing process of myocardial fibers and the surrounding architecture in the younger population, as well as the aging process, with an increase in vascular stiffness and a loss of myocytes in older populations. Higher LV mass/volume ratios in older women might be a contributor to the preferential development of diastolic heart failure in this population."

Arterial stiffness has been suggested as a significant contributor to the development of heart failure. We hypothesized that the association between arterial stiffness and LV diastolic function would be stronger in women than in men.Two-dimensional, Doppler echocardiography and radial artery tonometry were performed simultaneously in 158 age-matched subjects (79 males, 79 females; mean age: 58 ± 10 years) without any structural heart disease or LV systolic dysfunction.The peripheral blood pressure and pulse pressure (PP) were similar between sexes. However, central PP and augmentation index were significantly higher and PP amplification was significantly lower in women (1.31 vs. 1.19, p < 0.001). The associations of PP amplification with early diastolic mitral annular (Em) velocity and transmitral to mitral annular early diastolic velocity ratio (E/Em) were significant in women (r = 0.38, p = 0.001; r = -0.36, p = 0.001), whereas no significant association was found in men (r = 0.09, p = 0.428, r = -0.14, p = 0.215). Multiple regression analysis revealed that PP amplification had an independent correlation with Em velocity only in women.Despite similar peripheral PP, the central hemodynamics reflecting arterial stiffness were different between men and women. LV diastolic function correlates significantly with the parameters representing arterial stiffness only in women. We suggest that the effects of earlier wave reflection on central pressure may contribute to greater susceptibility to heart failure with preserved LV ejection fraction in women."

The etiology of HF influences both the selection and outcome of the treatment. There are variations between genders in morbidity and mortality in different studies, possibly reflecting etiology. The objective of this study was to examine the strength of evidence available for gender differences in the etiology of chronic heart failure.Computer-assisted searches from 1980-2009 for gender differences in the etiology of heart failure were performed (Medline, EMBASE and PubMed). From 2347 abstracts reviewed based on inclusion criteria, 35 original articles were chosen for review. Data extraction was based on observational studies (prospective/retrospective cohort or cross sectional) with a mean follow up of 3 months. There was no interrater variability between the 2 reviewers on data-extraction.Ventricular systolic dysfunction being more associated with male sex, but female sex was more reported to be associated with preserved left ventricular function. Ischemic etiology and associated coronary heart disease were strongly correlated with male sex. The risk for HF was dramatically more elevated for women with systolic hypertension but the association for diabetes mellitus as the etiology of HF was somewhat equal between males and females.One of the limitations in reaching conclusions about gender differences in cardiovascular disease is that many major clinical trials do not include a gender analysis nor they are powered to do so as women are under-represented in most of the HF studies. The need remains for a well designed prospective study of sufficient numbers of male and female patients with and without heart failure and analyzing etiology and risk factors based on the sex differences."

Heart failure (HF) is a common cause of cardiovascular death and carries a poor prognosis in both genders. Risk factors and myocardial adaptations in HF in men and women are different. Female hearts develop a more favorable physiological form of myocardial remodeling than male hearts. This may be related to sex hormones, estrogens and testosterone. A clinical study for gender differences in human aortic stenosis supports the hypotheses. HF management differs between both sexes, with underdiagnosis and undertreatment and less use of invasive therapies in women. Nevertheless, women frequently have better outcomes than men.

At baseline and 6 months after CRT, the clinical and echocardiographic parameters were obtained. All-cause mortality was compared between the men and women. The study population included 431 men (67 ± 9 years) and 147 women (65 ± 11 years). No differences in the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics were observed between the men and women, except for left bundle branch block and a nonischemic etiology of heart failure, which were more frequent in women (81% vs 68% and 63% vs 33%, respectively; p <0.01), and atrial fibrillation, which was more prevalent in men (20% vs 10%, respectively; p = 0.01).

The 2-year all-cause mortality rate was 15% in men and 8% in women (p = 0.025). Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed female gender is an independent predictor of long-term survival, together with heart failure etiology and renal function. In particular, women with heart failure due to a nonischemic etiology showed the best long-term survival rate.

Hence, in the recent years, the efforts of several research groups have specifically been devoted to deeply investigate the implication of the main forms of cell injury, necrosis, apoptosis and autophagy, in the development of cardiac and blood vessel alterations associated with human diseases. Furthermore, several lines of evidence demonstrate that CVD clearly display significant gender differences in terms of onset, progression and outcome. Cardiovascular cells contain functional estrogen and androgen receptors and are targets for sex hormone action, which can influence many physiological and pathological processes, including vascular and myocardial cell homeostasis. However, hormones are important but not unique actors in this issue, further genetic and epigenetic determinants being involved.

We previously showed that macrophages in the spleen are phenotypically distinct in male compared to female mice at 12 h after infection. This innate immune profile mirrors and predicts the cardiac immune response during acute myocarditis.In order to study sex differences in the innate immune response, five male and female BALB/c mice were infected intraperitoneally with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) or phosphate buffered saline and their spleens were harvested 12 h later for microarray analysis. Gene expression was determined using an Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. Significant gene changes were verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or ELISA.During the innate immune response to CVB3 infection, infected males had higher splenic expression of genes which are important in regulating the influx of cholesterol into macrophages, such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and the macrophage scavenger receptor compared to the infected females. We also observed a higher expression in infected males compared to infected females of squalene synthase, an enzyme used to generate cholesterol within cells, and Cyp2e1, an enzyme important in metabolizing cholesterol and steroids. Infected males also had decreased levels of the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), which binds PLA2 and is the rate-limiting step for steroidogenesis, as well as decreased expression of the androgen receptor (AR), which indicates receptor activation. Gene differences were not due to increased viral replication, which was unaltered between sexes.We found that, compared to females, male mice had a greater splenic expression of genes which are important for cholesterol metabolism and activation of the AR at 12 h after infection. Activation of the AR has been linked to increased cardiac hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, myocarditis/DCM and heart failure in male mice and humans."

Idiopathic PAH occurs more frequently in females than in males. The female:male ratio is 1.64 ∼ 3.88:1. Although endogenous sex hormones including estrogen have been suggested to account for the observed gender differences in PAH, a precise pathobiology for the gender differences remains uncertain. Recent studies demonstrated that estrogen exerts beneficial effects on the pulmonary vasculature. However, it seems to contradict the female predominance that is observed in idiopathic PAH. Moreover, Sweeney and Voelkel (Sweeney L and Voelkel NF. Eur J Med Res 14: 433-442, 2009) showed that early and long-term estrogen exposure might be correlated with an increased risk of the development of PAH. Here we ask the question: Is estrogen a friend or a foe? According to accumulating evidence, we postulate that the different effects of estrogens on different target cells could account for this paradox, i.e., estrogens may exert beneficial effects only on the increased muscularization of vessel walls, but not on phenotypically altered endothelial cells. The effects of estrogens on the pulmonary vasculature are potent and complex, yet not fully understood.

Concentrations of sST2 were significantly higher in males compared to females (24.9 vs. 16.9 ng/mL; p<0.0001) but were not correlated by age in either gender (r=-0.07; p=0.14). Reference intervals for sST2 were determined to be 8.6-49.3 and 7.2-33.5 ng/mL for males and females, respectively.The Presage ST2 ELISA had acceptable performance characteristics for quantifying sST2 in serum or plasma. The assay is precise and linear over a wide sST2 concentration range and can measure low sST2 concentrations. Concentrations of sST2 are unaffected by age but are higher in males compared to females."

Partners (age 70 +/- 9, 76% female) of HF patients were more likely to provide personal care compared with partners (age 65 +/- 7, 66% female) of healthy individuals after controlling for their age. However, the magnitude of the odds ratios (OR) differed by gender of partners (OR for male 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9-11.4; OR for female 3.7; 95% CI 2.7-5.1). Partners of HF patients were more likely to provide emotional care than partners of healthy individuals, controlling for age and gender (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.5-3.6). Male partners of HF patients were more likely to provide personal care compared to female partners of HF patients (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1-3.2).The care performed by partners of HF patients is above and beyond normal spousal assistance. The study underscores the crucial role of family caregivers in the care of HF patients and encourages health care providers to address the needs of both HF patients and their caregivers."

There is seasonal variability in morbidity and mortality of HF with significant gender differences, partially due to respiratory diseases, which may be potentionally preventable by vaccination. Quitting smoking is associated with substantial decrease in morbidity and mortality in HF patients which is similar in magnitude to the effect of an appropriate beta-blocker use. Yet little emphasis has been placed on smoking cessation strategies in women with HF and should be adopted as vigorously as proven medical therapy. Complications of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation were more frequent in females. Gender disparity exists in the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy, although they are beneficial for both women and men. Smaller women have limited access to left ventricular assist device (LVAD) because these devices require a minimum body surface to fit properly. Women were more likely than men to develop severe right ventricular failure after implantation of LVAD. Lower cut-off level of peak oxygen consumption was suggested for women to determine optimal timing for heart transplantation. Disease management programs probably narrows gender differences in quality of care and survival among HF patients. Women with HF have less access to cardiologists, although this consultation is associated with better quality of care, particularly for women. Despite these known sex differences, recommendations for HF are the same for women and men, because prospective sex-specific clinical trials have not been performed."

Indeed, experimental studies and post-mortem and observational clinical studies suggest the presence of important differences in myocardial remodeling between females and males in response to different types of injures including aging, pressure and volume overload, and myocardial infarction. Interestingly, the remodeling process appears to be more favorable in women versus men; women are more likely to present heart failure with preserved systolic function and are at greater risk for low output syndrome acutely. These differences between men and women are widely held to be related to sex hormones such as estrogen, although the molecular effects of estrogen on ventricular cardiomyocytes are incompletely understood. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting these notions and discuss the underlying mechanisms and the clinical implications."

It examines sex differences in the genetic susceptibility to cardiovascular disease (CVD) development or outcome: with the presence of either XX or XY chromosomes, every cell is sexually differentiated and there exist postpuberal differences between male and female cardiovascular systems. The main action mechanisms of sex steroid hormones are discussed, mainly as to testosterone (Te) in men and 17beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (Pro) in women. In women, susceptibility to CVD is known to increase in the postmenopausal period, when the ovarian hormone function expires. Some concepts of the sex-based differences in anatomy and physiology are also explained. Although they have the same structural elements, women and men use them in a different way to guarantee cardiovascular system homeostasis. Some examples of differences between men and women in pathological cardiovascular function are given. A further important issue regards the prevalence and role of cardiovascular risk factors in the two genders. Compared to boys of the same age, adolescent girls and premenopausal women have a more favorable risk profile: lower blood pressure (BP), less atherogenic lipid profile, and lower prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Women develop CVD later than men and diabetic women have a considerably higher mortality rate compared to men of the same age. Finally, there exist several clinically significant differences between men and women as to prevalence, presentation, management and outcome of CVD. Clinical peculiarities related to gender in presentation of some CVDs, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and heart failure, are described. We are absolutely convinced that only an accurate knowledge of the sex-specific pathophysiology may allow determination of the appropriate diagnostic instruments and to implement tailored treatments of CVD in men and women."

Patients were considered as being at risk for heart failure if data applied to stage A/B, or presenting overt heart failure if data applied to stage C/D of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification.From June 2006 to October 2007, 757 consecutive patients (475 male, 62.7%) were enrolled from 260 general practitioner's practices; 227 patients (143 male, 63.0%) had overt heart failure. In the female population at risk, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were observed, whereas males showed more frequently ischemic heart disease, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and were more often prescribed with statins and antiplatelet drugs. There were more heart failure females with diabetes and of advanced age. Moreover, females showed a higher pulse pressure and a significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (by simplified MDRD equation) than males.The data collected in a real world population show that heart failure has significantly different gender characteristics, especially for risk factors, age, blood pressure and renal function.

We performed transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham surgery in male and female wild-type (WT) and ERbeta knockout (ERbeta(-/-)) mice. All mice were characterized by echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements and were killed 9 wk after surgery. Left ventricular (LV) samples were analyzed by microarray profiling, real-time RT-PCR, and histology. After 9 wk, WT males showed more hypertrophy and heart failure signs than WT females. Notably, WT females developed a concentric form of hypertrophy, while males developed eccentric hypertrophy. ERbeta deletion augmented the TAC-induced increase in cardiomyocyte diameter in both sexes. Gene expression profiling revealed that WT male hearts had a stronger induction of matrix-related genes and a stronger repression of mitochondrial genes than WT female hearts. ERbeta(-/-) mice exhibited a different transcriptional response. ERbeta(-/-)/TAC mice of both sexes exhibited induction of proapoptotic genes with a stronger expression in ERbeta(-/-) males. Cardiac fibrosis was more pronounced in male WT/TAC than in female mice. This difference was abolished in ERbeta(-/-) mice. The number of apoptotic nuclei was increased in both sexes of ERbeta(-/-)/TAC mice, most prominent in males. Female sex offers protection against ventricular chamber dilation in the TAC model. Both female sex and ERbeta attenuate the development of fibrosis and apoptosis, thus slowing the progression to heart failure."

Given gender differences in symptom experience, examination of potential gender differences in clusters is reasonable.The objective of the study was to compare symptom clusters between men and women with HF, differences in patient characteristics among symptom clusters, and the impact of symptom clusters on cardiac event-free survival.A total of 331 patients with HF recruited from HF clinics were included (35% were female and 62% were of New York Heart Association classes III/IV). Cluster analysis was used to identify symptom clusters between men and women based on ratings of distress related to 7 symptoms. Analysis of variance or chi test was used to compare characteristics of patient groups that were divided by the median split of total distress scores of each cluster. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine whether total scores of symptom distress in symptom clusters predicted time to first cardiac event.Two identical symptom clusters were identified in men and women: a physical symptom cluster composed of dyspnea, fatigue/increased need to rest, fatigue/low energy, and sleep disturbances and an emotional/cognitive symptom cluster composed of worrying, feeling depressed, and cognitive problems. Patients with higher distress from the physical symptom cluster were primarily females and of New York Heart Association classes III and IV (P < .05). Patients with higher distress from the emotional/cognitive symptom cluster were younger than those with lower distress (P < .05). The total symptom distress score in the emotional/cognitive cluster, but not the physical cluster, was an independent predictor of cardiac event-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.37).Although distress for individual symptoms may differ between men and women, they both experienced identical symptom clusters. Only the emotional/cognitive cluster predicted a higher risk for a cardiac event. These results suggested that interventions should be developed that consider symptom clusters. Targeting patients who have high distress from emotional/cognitive symptoms may be particularly important as they may be most vulnerable for adverse outcomes."

An analysis of in-depth interviews was used to describe gender-specific barriers and facilitators of self-care. After the interview data were analyzed, the results were confirmed in quantitative data obtained from the same sample and at the same time. Concordance between qualitative and quantitative data was assessed.There were no consistent gender-specific differences in self-care practices but there were distinct gender differences in the decisions made in interpreting and responding to symptoms. The men were better than the women at interpreting their symptoms as being related to HF and in initiating treatment. These differences were associated with differences in self-care confidence, social support, and mood.Gender-specific differences in self-care behaviors are minimal. However, gender-specific barriers and facilitators greatly influence the choice of self-care behaviors."

It affects men at younger age than women. Women have more frequently diastolic HF, associated with the major risk factors of diabetes and hypertension and men have more frequently systolic HF because of coronary artery disease. Under stress, male hearts develop more easily pathological hypertrophy with dilatation and poor systolic function than female hearts. Women with aortic stenosis have more concentric hypertrophy with better systolic function, less upregulation of extracellular matrix genes and better reversibility after unloading. Stressed female hearts maintain energy metabolism better than male hearts and are better protected against calcium overload. Estrogens and androgens and their receptors are present in the myocardium and lead to coordinated regulation of functionally relevant pathways. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a more ominous sign in women than in men. Men with end-stage cardiomyopathy more frequently have auto-antibodies than women. Women receive less guideline-based diagnostics and therapy. Expensive and invasive therapies such as advanced pacemakers and transplantation are underused in women. Drug studies point at sex differences in efficacy. Despite worse diagnostics and therapy, prognosis is better in women than in men."

Increased endothelin-1-mediated vasoconstriction has been linked to the etiology of a number of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, heart failure, and hypertension. It is unknown whether a sex difference in endothelin-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone exists in middle-aged and older adults. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that middle-aged and older men would demonstrate greater ET-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone than age-matched women. Forearm blood flow in response to intra-arterial infusions of endothelin (ET)-1, BQ-123 (a selective ET(A) receptor antagonist), and BQ-788 (a selective ET(B) receptor antagonist) was assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography in 21 women (age: 58 + or - 1 yr; body mass index: 26.0 + or - 1.0 kg/m(2)) and 25 men (age: 57 + or - 2 yr; body mass index: 26.8 + or - 0.7 kg/m(2)). In response to BQ-123, the increase in forearm blood flow from baseline was significantly higher in the men than the women (24 + or - 5% vs. 9 + or - 5%; P < 0.05). In contrast, the increase in forearm blood flow in response to BQ-123 coinfused with BQ-788 was greater in the women than the men, such that the maximum vasodilation to dual endothelin receptor blockade was similar between men and women (approximately 25%). There was no difference in the vasoconstrictor response to ET-1 between the sexes. These results indicate that middle-aged and older men are under greater ET(A) receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor tone than age-matched women. Since the ET(A) receptor is the predominant receptor subtype in the coronary vasculature, this sex difference in vasoconstrictor tone may be a mechanism contributing to the sex difference in the prevalence of coronary heart disease in middle-aged and older adults."

In addition, we measured calcineurin protein expression. Heart-to-body weight ratio was increased in Galphaq mice. Female wild-type mice showed higher eNOS protein expression and activation (translocation and phosphorylation) than did wild-type males. In cardiac tissue of Galphaq mice, these sex-dependent differences remained or were enhanced. Protein expression of the catalytic subunit calcineurin A, which has been shown to dephosphorylate eNOS, was higher in wild-type males than in wild-type females. These differences were increased in the Galphaq mice model. We conclude that sex differences exist in cardiac eNOS protein expression and phosphorylation.

In contrast to males, female rats exhibited no adverse ventricular remodeling and less mortality in response to volume overload. This gender-specific cardioprotection was lost following ovariectomy and was partially restored using estrogen replacement. However, it is not known if estrogen treatment would be as effective in males. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the structural and functional effects of estrogen in male rats subjected to chronic volume overload. Four groups of male rats were studied at 3 days and 8 wk postsurgery as follows: fistula and sham-operated controls, with and without estrogen treatment. Biochemical and histological studies were performed at 3 days postsurgery, with chronic structural and functional effects studied at 8 wk. Measurement of systolic and diastolic pressure-volume relationships was obtained using a blood-perfused isolated heart preparation. Both fistula groups developed significant ventricular hypertrophy after 8 wk of volume overload. Untreated rats with fistula exhibited extensive ventricular dilatation, which was coupled with a loss of systolic function. Estrogen attenuated left ventricular dilatation and maintained function in treated rats. Estrogen treatment was also associated with a reduction in oxidative stress and circulating endothelin-1 levels, as well as prevention of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 activation and breakdown of ventricular collagen in the early stage of remodeling. These data demonstrate that estrogen attenuates ventricular remodeling and disease progression in male rats subjected to chronic volume overload."

Dilated cardiomyopathy in transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative CREB transcription factor in the heart. J Clin Invest 101: 2415-2426, 1998). In the present study, we demonstrated significantly elevated mortality and contractile dysfunction in female compared with male dnCREB mice. Female dnCREB mice demonstrated a 21-wk survival of only 17% compared with 67% in males (P < 0.05) and exclusively manifest decreased cardiac peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α and estrogen-related receptor-α content, suggesting sex-related effects on cardiac mitochondrial function. Hearts from 4-wk-old dnCREB mice of both sexes demonstrated diminished mitochondrial respiratory capacity compared with nontransgenic controls. However, by 12 wk of age, there was a significant decrease in mitochondrial density (citrate synthase activity) and deterioration of mitochondrial structure, as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy, in female dnCREB mice, which were not found in male transgenic littermates. Subsarcolemmal mitochondria isolated from hearts of female, but not male, dnCREB mice demonstrated increased ROS accompanied by decreases in the expression/activity of the mitochondrial antioxidants MnSOD and glutathione peroxidase. These results demonstrate that heart-specific dnCREB expression results in mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction in both sexes; however, increased oxidant burden, reduced antioxidant expression, and disrupted mitochondrial structure are exacerbated by the female sex, preceding and contributing to the greater contractile morbidity and mortality. These results provide further support for the role of the CREB transcription factor in regulating mitochondrial integrity and identify a critical pathway that may contribute to sex differences in heart failure."

In the general population, although median plasma BNP levels have been reported to be higher in women than in men, the incidence of CHF and mortality are lower in women. However, no studies have examined gender-specific risk stratification of plasma BNP levels for future onset of CHF and mortality.Subjects of this study were recruited from our general population. Baseline data including plasma BNP were determined in 13,466 subjects (men 4527, women 8939; median age = 64 yrs). A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the predictive ability of plasma BNP for new onset of CHF and mortality.The mean follow-up duration was 2.9 years. After adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors including atrial fibrillation, hazard ratios for CHF development for values above the 75th percentile of BNP were 13.4 (p<0.001) in men and 8.5 (p<0.001) in women. Similarly, each increment of 1SD in log BNP levels increased the hazard ratio by 8.8 (p<0.001) in men, and 6.7 (p<0.001) in women. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was significant for prediction of the onset of CHF (men; 0.853, women; 0.838). In addition, increased plasma BNP levels implied high risk of any-cause mortality in men (above the 75th percentile; hazard ratio = 1.8, p=0.005: increment of 1SD; hazard ratio = 1.4, p=0.024), but this relationship was suboptimal in women.Measurements of plasma BNP provides strong predictive information about future onset of CHF in both sexes, with predictive ability for death being effective especially in men."

The baseline ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic volume, and end-systolic volume were assessed in 7,016 patients in the study ""A Coronary disease Trial Investigating Outcomes with Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system"" (ACTION). All-cause and cardiac mortality and incident heart failure were determined after a median of 5.0 years. Cox proportional hazard models were fit to determine the effect of gender on the relation between the echocardiographic parameters and clinical outcomes (interaction p <0.10). The association between the EF and mortality differed significantly between men and women, with women demonstrating a marked increase in risk as the EF decreased, compared to men (interaction p = 0.03, adjusted p = 0.07). Also, a significant interaction by gender was seen for the association between the end-systolic volume and the risk of heart failure (interaction p = 0.01, adjusted p = 0.05). In conclusion, the relation between EF and mortality differed according to gender in patients with chronic coronary disease, with women having a greater risk of adverse outcomes as the EF decreased. Similar findings were observed with the end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and the risk of heart failure. These findings may reflect inherent gender-based differences in ischemic heart disease and cardiac remodeling and might help to identify women at high risk."

General characteristics and hemodynamic assessment revealed the presence of cardiac hypertrophy at 4 weeks of AV shunt in male (n = 12) and female (n = 12) rats, whereas heart failure was seen at 16 weeks in male rats only. Although a decrease in apoptosis was seen in hearts of both sexes at 4 weeks, an increase in apoptosis in males and a reduction in the female heart were observed at 16 weeks of AV shunt. Unlike females, increases in the pro-apoptotic proteins, BAX, caspases 3 and 9 were seen in 16 weeks post-AV shunt in male rats. While an increase in phospho-Bad was detected, phospho-Bcl-2 protein was decreased in males. Females showed an increase in only phospho-Bcl-2 protein at 16 weeks post-AV shunt. Ovariectomy (n = 12) abolished the increase in phospho-Bcl-2 protein, but this was restored by treatment with 17-beta estradiol. These data suggest that downregulation of phospho-Bcl-2 and an upregulation of BAX may play a major role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis in heart failure due to volume overload in male rats. Furthermore, upregulation of phospho-Bcl-2 in the heart due to estrogen may confer resistance against cardiomyocyte apoptosis in females."

A better understanding of mechanisms involved may influence treatment strategies. The incidence and prevalence of HF are lower in women. We explored sexual dimorphism in the progression of HF using a mice model of neurohormonal-dependent HF. Male and female mice overexpressing the human beta2-adrenergic receptor (TG4 strain) develop HF. We compared TG4 animals with age-matched wild-type controls. Cardiac function was studied in vivo by echocardiography and electrocardiography. Histological studies were performed. Conduction parameters were assessed by intracardiac electrophysiological exploration, as was the occurrence of spontaneous and inducible arrhythmias. The patch-clamp technique was used to determine the cellular electrophysiological profile. The role of hormonal status in HF progression was investigated by surgical gonadectomy. High mortality rate was observed in TG4 mice with a dramatic difference between males and females. Male TG4 mice exhibited intraventricular conduction abnormalities, as measured by infrahisian interval and QRS durations potentially determining reentrant circuits and increasing susceptibility to arrhythmia. The severity of HF was correlated with the degree of fibrosis, which was modulated by the gonadal hormones. Action potentials recorded from male and female left ventricular cardiomyocytes were indistinguishable, although both sexes exhibited delayed repolarization when compared with their wild-type counterparts. In conclusion, female TG4 mice were better protected than males against cardiac remodeling and rhythm disorders. A link between fibrosis, conduction time, and mortality was established in relation with sex hormones."

CHF can severely affect people's quality of life by reducing their independence and ability to undertake certain activities of daily living, as well as affecting their psychosocial and economic capacity. This paper reports the findings of a systematic narrative review of qualitative studies concerning people's experience of living with CHF, aiming to develop a wide-ranging understanding of what is known about the patient experience.We searched eight relevant electronic databases using the terms based on the diagnosis of 'chronic heart failure', 'heart failure' and 'congestive heart failure' and qualitative methods, with restrictions to the years 1990-May 2008. We also used snowballing, hand searching and the expert knowledge of the research team to ensure all relevant papers were included in the review. Of 65 papers collected less than half (n = 30) were found relevant for this review. These papers were subsequently summarised and entered into QSR NVivo7 for data management and analysis.The review has identified the most prominent impacts of CHF on a person's everyday life including social isolation, living in fear and losing a sense of control. It has also identified common strategies through which patients with CHF manage their illness such as sharing experiences and burdens with others and being flexible to changing circumstances. Finally, there are multiple factors that commonly impact on patients' self care and self-management in the disease trajectory including knowledge, understanding and health service encounters. These health service encounters encompass access, continuity and quality of care, co-morbid conditions, and personal relationships.The core and sub-concepts identified within this study provide health professionals, service providers, policy makers and educators with broad insights into common elements of people's experiences of CHF and potential options for improving their health and wellbeing. Future studies should focus on building a comprehensive picture of CHF through examination of differences between genders, and differences within age groups, socioeconomic groups and cultural groups."

A large proportion of the population with CVD will die with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF). It is becoming increasingly recognized that sex differences exist in the etiology, development, and outcome of CHF. For example, compared to male counterparts, women that present with CHF are typically older and have systolic cardiac function that is not impaired. Despite a growing body of literature addressing the underlying mechanisms of sex dimorphisms in cardiac disease, there remain significant inconsistencies reported in these studies. Given that the development of CHF results from the complex integration of genetic and nongenetic cues, it is not surprising that the elucidation and subsequent identification of molecular mechanisms remains unclear. In this review, key aspects of sex differences in CVD and CHF will be highlighted with an emphasis on some of the unanswered questions regarding these differences. The contention is presented that it becomes critical to reference cellular mechanisms within the context of each sex to better understand these sex dimorphisms."

Age and gender are important predictors of mortality in hospitalized HF patients. However, studies assessing short- and long-term risk of death stratified by age and gender are scarce.A nationwide cohort was identified (ICD-9 codes 402, 428) and followed through linkage of national registries. The crude 28-day, 1-year and 5-year mortality was computed by age and gender. Cox regression models were used for each period to study sex differences adjusting for potential confounders (age and comorbidities).14,529 men, mean age 74 ± 11 years and 14,524 women, mean age 78 ± 11 years were identified. Mortality risk after admission for HF increased with age and the risk of death was higher among men than women. Hazard ratio's (men versus women and adjusted for age and co-morbidity) were 1.21 (95%CI 1.14 to 1.28), 1.26 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.31), and 1.28 (95%CI 1.24 to 1.31) for 28 days, 1 year and 5 years mortality, respectively.This study clearly shows age- and gender differences in short- and long-term risk of death after first hospitalization for HF with men having higher short- and long-term risk of death than women. As our study population includes both men and women from all ages, the estimates we provide maybe a good reflection of 'daily practice' risk of death and therefore be valuable for clinicians and policymakers."

As emerging epidemiologic data reveal a growing prevalence and burden of disease among women, it is increasingly important that treating physicians and researchers recognize sex-based differences. Despite the overall incidence of heart failure being lower in women compared with men, the magnitude of improvement in survival over the last several decades has been less apparent in women. Women with heart failure are more likely to be older, have preserved systolic function and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. While clinical trials have demonstrated improved outcomes among heart failure patients, they have predominantly included men, yielding results that are sometimes inadequately powered to detect a benefit for women. Without adequate representation of women in clinical trials, one cannot assume that the same level of therapeutic evidence also applies to women. Nonetheless, it appears that beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors provide the same survival benefits in women with systolic dysfunction as in men. In addition, some studies suggest that angiotensin-receptor blockers may lead to a better survival in women when compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Focused research is needed to understand and guide the management of women with heart failure."

Serum concentrations of progesterone, estradiol, C-reactive protein (CRP), and urea were measured at baseline (1996) and at 8-year follow-up (2004), and serum concentrations of cystatin and insulin were measured only at follow-up. The outcomes of interest were cardiovascular morbidity (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, congestive heart failure [CHF], cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, and thromboembolism), diabetes, and mortality throughout the observation period.At baseline, the study sample included 230 men and 195 women (mean [SD] age, 74.6 [2.6] years). At follow-up, 132 men and 145 women (mean age, 82.4 [2.5] years) met the inclusion criteria, of whom 128 men and 112 women did so at both baseline and follow-up. Serum progesterone concentrations, which did not differ significantly from reported concentrations for the age group, were significantly associated with mortality across the observation period (P < 0.001). At follow-up, higher serum progesterone was significantly associated with the occurrence of CHF (P < 0.01); this association remained robust after adjustment for CRP, cystatin, and insulin levels.In these elderly Swedish men and women, increased physiologic concentrations of progesterone were found to be associated with an increased prevalence of CHF, independent of inflammatory factors, markers of renal function, and insulin metabolism."

Multivariate comparisons were made to determine if gender explained sufficient variance in HF self-care and the likelihood of reporting adequate self-care, controlling for nine model covariates.The sample was comprised of 1306 men and 776 women. Most (73.5%) had systolic or mixed systolic and diastolic HF and 45% had New York Heart Association class III or IV HF. Although small and clinically insignificant gender differences were found in self-care maintenance, gender was not a determinant of any aspect of HF self-care in multivariate models. Married women were 37% less likely to report adequate self-care maintenance than unmarried women. Comorbidities only influenced the HF self-care of men. Being newly diagnosed with HF also primarily affected men. Patients with diastolic HF (predominantly women) had poorer self-care maintenance and less confidence in self-care.Differences in HF self-care are attributable to factors other than gender; however, there are several gender-specific determinants of HF self-care that help identify patients at risk for practicing poor self-care."

We now tested whether NF-kappaB inhibition is able to block LV remodelling upon chronic pressure overload and chronic AngII stimulation.Cardiac-restricted NF-kappaB inhibition was achieved by expression of a stabilized IkappaBalpha mutant (IkappaBalphaDeltaN) in cells with an active alpha-myosin heavy chain (alphaMHC) promoter employing the Cre/lox technique. Upon low-gradient trans-aortic constriction (TAC, gradient 21 +/- 3 mmHg), hypertrophy was induced in both male and female control mice after 4 weeks. At this time, LV hypertrophy was blocked in transgenic (TG) male but not female mice with NF-kappaB inhibition. Amelioration of LV hypertrophy was associated with activation of NF-kappaB by dihydrotestosterone in isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes. LV remodelling was not attenuated by NF-kappaB inhibition after 8 weeks TAC, demonstrated by decreased fractional shortening (FS) in both control and TG mice irrespective of gender. Similar results were obtained when TAC was performed with higher gradients (48 +/- 4 mmHg). In TG mice, FS dropped to similar low levels over the same time course [FS sham, 29 +/- 1% (mean +/- SEM); FS control + 14 days TAC, 13 +/- 3%; FS TG + 14 days TAC, 9 +/- 5%]. Similarly, LV remodelling was accelerated by NF-kappaB inhibition in an AngII-dependent genetic heart failure model (AT1-R(alphaMHC)) associated with significantly increased cardiac fibrosis in double AT1-R(alphaMHC)/TG mice.NF-kappaB inhibition attenuates cardiac hypertrophy in a gender-specific manner but does not alter the course of stress-induced LV remodelling, indicating NF-kappaB to be required for adaptive cardiac hypertrophy."

In the future, however, HF care may need to be tailored by sex, as the best way to optimize outcomes for both men and women. Because prior studies demonstrated sex-related differences in many aspects of HF care (in the appropriate use and dosing of evidence-based therapy and in the individual response to pharmacological treatment between women and men with HF). In general, benefit of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and spironolactone in clinical trials was similar, regardless ofgender. Women with HF appear to have significantly lower mortality rates on ARBs than on the more standard HF therapy (ACE inhibitors), but there was no difference in survival in men prescribed ARBs compared to ACE inhibitors. In a post hoc subgroup analysis digoxin was associated with a increased risk of death from any cause among women with HF, but not men. ACE inhibitor-induced cough was more frequent among women. The risk ofhyperkalemia was increased with male gender in HF patients treated with candesartan. The use ofspironolactone was inversely associated with fractures in men with CHF. Previous studies have suggested that female with HF are less likely received guideline-recommended therapies (in appropriate doses). Female patients with HF were less likely to receive certain guideline-recommended evidence-based treatments, but the influence of patient sex on delivery of these therapies was disappeared when the objective reasons for non-using of these therapies were taken into account. These sex differences could have potential widespread implications for routine heart failure care."

They often present at an older age with better systolic function than men. For both sexes, there is significant morbidity, but age-adjusted data reveal that women have a better survival.

Coronary heart disease (PAR, 23.9% for white participants and 29.5% for black participants) and uncontrolled blood pressure (PAR, 21.3% for white participants and 30.1% for black participants) carried the highest PAR in both races. Among black participants, 6 of 8 risk factors assessed (smoking, increased heart rate, coronary heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, uncontrolled blood pressure, and reduced glomerular filtration rate) had more than 5% higher PAR compared with that among white participants, leading to a higher overall proportion of HF attributable to modifiable risk factors in black participants vs white participants (67.8% vs 48.9%). Participants who developed HF had higher annual mortality (18.0% vs 2.7%). No racial difference in survival after HF was noted; however, rehospitalization rates were higher among black participants (62.1 vs 30.3 hospitalizations per 100 person-years, P < .001).Incident HF is common in older persons; a large proportion of HF risk is attributed to modifiable risk factors.

Heart failure will continue to be a central public health issue in the future as the population ages. This article focuses on regional differences, the costs of the disease, and the expected rate of increase in cases in the near future.This analysis is based on diagnosis statistics, cause-of-death statistics, and cost of illness data, as reported by the German Federal Statistical Office. Age- and sex-specific differences are taken into account.2006 was the first year in which heart failure led to more hospital admissions in Germany (317 000) than any other diagnosis. At present, about 141 000 persons in Germany aged 80 and over have heart failure; by the year 2050, it is predicted that more than 350 000 persons in this age group will be affected. The rate of diagnosis of heart failure, its frequency as a cause of death, and the costs associated with it all vary across the individual states of the Federal Republic of Germany. The nationwide cost of heart failure in 2006 was estimated at 2.9 billion euros.These findings reveal that heart failure has become more common as an admission diagnosis of hospitalized patients in Germany. Because the population is aging, new concepts for prevention and treatment will be needed in the near future so that the affected patients can continue to receive adequate care."

Data were stratified and analyzed as male/female and by age tertiles with generalized estimating equation models constructed for 7 care measures.A total of 15,381 patients were enrolled, with 8,770 (71.1%) of these male. Median age of female patients was 72.0 and 70.0 for males. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, aldosterone inhibitors, and cardiac resynchronization therapy was not significantly different between male and female patients, but rates for implantable cardioverter defibrillators, anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation, and HF education were significantly lower for females. After adjusting for patient and practice characteristics, 3 of 7 measures significantly differed by patient sex, and 6 of 7 measures by age. Older patients, particularly older women, were significantly less likely to receive guideline-indicated HF therapies.Patient age and sex were independently associated with reduced rates of some, but not all, HF therapies in outpatient cardiology practices.

The use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers is now well established in the treatment of mild and moderate systolic heart failure. Although there are significant differences among agents, their clinical effects are predictable. To address the question of sex disparities in the heart, however, we investigated the effect of treatment with the nonselective beta-blockers timolol and propranolol on mechanical and electrical function of heart preparations from male and female rats. We examined the long-term effects of intragastric treatment with timolol (5 mg/kg per day) or propranolol (25 mg/kg per day) for 7 months on the hemodynamic and intracellular action potential parameters of the heart. Chronic administration of timolol but not propranolol produced a significant increase in the baseline activity of the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) in both male and female rats with no significant effect on the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Timolol or propranolol treatment of male rats and timolol but not propranolol treatment of female rats induced significant shortening in the repolarization phases of action potentials recorded from left ventricular papillary muscle strips of the hearts. The responses of LVDP to beta-adrenergic stimulation were similar in timolol- or propranolol-treated or untreated male rats. On the other hand, timolol treatment markedly increased, and propranolol treatment significantly decreased, the responses of increase in LVDP in female rats. Our results suggest that although treatment with beta-blockers for 7 months confirmed the role of the beta-adrenergic pathway in heart function, there are marked differences in the effects of individual beta-blockers on heart physiology. Sex differences should be taken into consideration when using beta-blockers during experimental studies and clinical therapy."

We examined the relative contribution of social and clinical factors to HRQL among older home care clients and explored whether any of the observed associations varied by sex.The Canadian-US sample included 514 clients. Self-reported HRQL was measured during in-home interviews (2002-04) using the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2). Data on clients' sociodemographic, health and clinical characteristics were obtained with the Minimum Data Set for Home Care. The relative associations between clients' characteristics and HUI2 scores were examined using multivariable linear regression models.Women had a significantly lower mean HUI2 score than men (0.48, 95%CI 0.46-0.50 vs. 0.52, 0.49-0.55). Clients with distressed caregivers and poor self-rated health exhibited significantly lower HRQL scores after adjustment for a comprehensive list of clinical conditions. Several other factors remained statistically significant (arthritis, psychiatric illness, bladder incontinence, urinary tract infection) or clinically important (reported loneliness, congestive heart failure, pressure ulcers) correlates of lower HUI2 scores in adjusted analyses. These associations generally did not vary significantly by sex.For females and males, HRQL scores were negatively associated with conditions predictive or indicative of disability and with markers of psychosocial stress. Despite sex differences in the prevalence of social and clinical factors likely to affect HRQL, few varied significantly by sex in their relative impact on HUI2 scores. Further exploration of differences in the relative importance of clinical and psychosocial well-being (e.g., loneliness) to HRQL among female and male clients may help guide the development of sex-specific strategies for risk screening and care management."

We used a transverse aortic constriction (TAC) mouse model leading to hypertrophy without sex differences in cardiac function after 2 weeks, but with sex differences in hypertrophy 6 and 9 weeks after TAC. Cardiac gene expression was analyzed 2 weeks after surgery. Deregulated genes were classified into functional gene ontology (GO) categories and used for pathway analysis. Classical marker genes of hypertrophy were similarly upregulated in both sexes (alpha-actin, ANP, BNP, CTGF). Thirty-five genes controlling mitochondrial function (PGC-1, cytochrome oxidase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) had lower expression in males compared to females after TAC. Genes encoding ribosomal proteins and genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling exhibited relative higher expression in males (collagen 3, matrix metalloproteinase 2, TIMP2, and TGFbeta2, all about twofold) after TAC. We confirmed 87% of the gene expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction. By GO classification, female-specific genes were related to mitochondria and metabolism and males to matrix and biosynthesis. Promoter studies confirmed the upregulation of PGC-1 by E2. Less downregulation of metabolic genes in female hearts and increased protein synthesis capacity and deregulation of matrix remodeling in male hearts characterize the sex-specific early response to PO. These differences could contribute to subsequent sex differences in cardiac function and HF."

As the leading hospital discharge diagnosis in the United States in patients over the age of 65, it is also associated with substantial economic costs. While the acute symptoms of volume overload frequently precipitate inpatient admission, it is the symptoms of chronic heart failure, including fatigue, exercise intolerance and exertional dyspnea, that impact quality of life. Over the last two decades, research into the enzymatic, histologic and neurohumoral alterations seen with heart failure have revealed that hemodynamic derangements do not necessarily correlate with symptoms. This ""hemodynamic paradox"" is explained by alterations in the skeletal musculature that occur in response to hemodynamic derangements. Importantly, gender specific effects appear to modify both disease pathophysiology and response to therapy.

The gender difference in overall mortality was seen in the placebo group, while no gender difference in overall mortality was seen in the ICD group. There was a significantly lower absolute risk of death in the placebo arm women, compared with the placebo arm men (annual mortality rate approximately 4% vs. 6%).The impact of ICD therapy appears to differ between men and women in this trial, with a smaller ICD benefit among women.

Female gender independently predicted increased cardiac work (p < 0.001). Female gender also related to lower efficiency (p < 0.05). Obesity and female gender independently predicted greater MBF (p < 0.01, p < 0.0005, respectively) and MVO(2) (p < 0.0005, p < 0.0001). Myocardial glucose uptake was not different among the 4 subject groups, but obesity and gender interacted in predicting glucose uptake (p < 0.05). Lower myocardial glucose utilization was independently predicted by female gender (p < 0.05), and it independently predicted lower myocardial glucose utilization/plasma insulin (p < 0.05). Obesity and gender significantly interacted in the determination of glucose utilization/plasma insulin (p = 0.01). There were no differences in FA uptake among the 4 groups, and although increasing obesity correlated with greater myocardial FA utilization and oxidation; female gender (p < 0.005, p < 0.01) and plasma triglycerides (p < 0.05, p < 0.005) were their independent predictors.Women's and men's myocardial metabolic responses to obesity are not exactly the same. Obesity and gender modulate MBF and MVO(2), are related to myocardial substrate metabolism, and sometimes interact in its prediction. Gender modifies efficiency. Gender-related differences in myocardial metabolism may affect the development of/adaptation to obesity-related cardiac disease."

In heart failure, however, exact numbers are unknown, in part secondary to under-reporting and under-interrogating by health care providers. A gender-specific questionnaire was modified from established sexual dysfunction questionnaires to correspond to a non-randomized outpatient heart failure population, to assess the prevalence and demographic distribution of sexual dysfunction and potential treatments expectations. One-hundred patients in a stable hemodynamic condition in New York Heart Association classes I-III participated. Eighty-seven percent of women were diagnosed with female sexual dysfunction compared to 84% of men with erectile dysfunction. Eighty percent of women reported reduced lubrication, which resulted in frequent unsuccessful intercourse in 76%. Thirty-six percent of patients thought that sexual activity could harm their current cardiac condition; 75% of females and 60% of men stated that no physicians ever asked about potential sexual problems. Fifty-two percent of men considered sexual activity in their current condition as an essential aspect of quality of life and 61% were interested in treatment to improve sexual function. Sexual dysfunction appears to be high in prevalence in both men and women with chronic compensated heart failure and represents a reduction in quality of life for most. Despite the fact that most patients are interested in receiving therapy to improve sexual dysfunction, treatment options are rarely discussed or initiated."

This retrospective study examined ICD use in heart-failure patients who had an indication for ICD implantation, from the ""Get with the Guidelines"" program. The patients were stratified by gender and ethnicity (Black vs White). The overall rate of utilization (or intention for utilization) of ICDs was 35%, while among women and Black people the rate was significantly lower, at 27 and 23%, respectively, with the lowest rate being for Black women (28%). These findings suggest a bias against implantation of such devices in women and Black people, which is not explained by clinical variables."

Women more frequently had new-onset AHF, hypertension and valvular disease and less frequently coronary heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy compared with men. Smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral arterial disease and renal failure were less common, but diabetes and anaemia significantly more frequent in women. Atrial fibrillation and preserved left ventricular function were more common in women. Men were more often non-compliant with medication. After adjustment for indications and age, there were no significant gender differences in prescription of HF medication. All-cause readmission rate during the one-year follow-up was lower in women. However, the proportion of HF hospitalisation and one-year mortality after discharge (20%) were similar in both genders.Women frequently present with new-onset AHF. A significant gender difference exists in aetiology, ventricular function and co-morbidities. Women's use of HF medication has improved. These findings emphasize the importance of individualised management and need for more comprehensive recruitment of women in clinical trials."

As compared with male patients, female patients were more likely to be older, have preserved systolic function and non-ischemic etiology of CHF, and underuse standard CHF medications. Although a previous study showed that sex-difference was not a significant prognostic factor in CHF patients, the unadjusted survival analysis revealed an increased event rate in female patients in the present study. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age, diabetes, ventricular tachycardia and anemia were significant prognostic risks in both men and women with CHF.Female sex had a significant link with elderly CHF patients. Given the explosive increase in elderly patients in Westernized countries, further studies are needed to elucidate the evidence for treatment of female CHF patients."

Modifiable factors, including psychosocial status, knowledge, and physical factors, are thought to influence heart failure self-care, but little is known about their combined impact on self-care.The objective of this study was to identify factors related to self-care behaviors in patients with heart failure.A cross-sectional, correlational study design was used.One hundred twenty-two patients (77 men and 45 women, mean age 60+/-12 years old, 66% New York Heart Association functional class III/IV) were recruited from the outpatient clinics of an academic medical center and two community hospitals.Data on self-care behaviors (Self-Care of Heart Failure Index), depressive symptoms, perceived control, self-care confidence, knowledge, functional status, and social support were collected. Factors related to self-care were examined using hierarchical multiple regression.Mean self-care behavior scores were less than 70 indicating the majority of men and women with HF did not consistently engage in self-care behaviors. Higher self-care confidence and perceived control and better heart failure management knowledge were associated with better self-care (r2=.25, p<.001). Higher perceived control and better knowledge were related to better self-care behaviors in men (r2=.18, p=.001), while higher self-care confidence and poorer functional status were related to better self-care behaviors in women (r2=.35, p<.001).This study demonstrates the substantial impact of modifiable factors such as confidence in one's self-care abilities, perceived control, and knowledge on self-care behaviors. This study demonstrates that there are gender differences in factors affecting self-care, even though at baseline men and women have similar knowledge levels, physical, psychological, and behavioral status. Effective interventions focusing on modifiable factors and the unique characteristics of men and women should be provided to improve self-care behaviors in patients with heart failure."

We reviewed 278 consecutive patients (age 54 +/- 12 years, cardiac index 1.7 +/- 0.4 L/kg/m(2), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 26 +/- 9 mm Hg, serum creatinine 1.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dl) with ADHF treated with intensive medical therapy guided by pulmonary artery catheter in a dedicated heart failure intensive care unit from 2000 to 2006. Compared with men (n = 226), women (n = 52) had similar baseline characteristics with the exception of a higher prevalence of nonischemic cause. No differences in medical therapy on admission, during intensive medical therapy, or at discharge were observed. Intensive medical therapy was associated with significant hemodynamic improvement independent of gender. All-cause mortality and heart failure rehospitalization rates were similar between genders. However, adjusted for cause, women with ischemic cardiomyopathy had higher all-cause mortality rates (50% vs 37%, hazard ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 3.90, p = 0.05) and those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy had lower all-cause mortality rates (19% vs 40%, hazard ratio 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.17 to 0.96, p = 0.01) than men.

Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2008 Aug,Pathophysiology,Mouse,na,,"Recent awareness of cardiovascular diseases as a number one killer of the middle-aged women has prompted interest in sex differences leading to heart failure (HF). Therefore, we evaluated cardiac function in female and male mice following myocardial infarction (MI) using the Millar pressure-volume (P-V) conductance system in vivo, at time points corresponding to early (2 wk), late compensatory hypertrophy (4 wk), and decompensation (10 wk) to HF. A significant deterioration of the load dependent and independent hemodynamic measurements occurred in both female and male mice during the early phase of hypertrophy. Later, compensatory hypertrophy was marked by a normalization of volumes to control levels in females compared with males. The most notable differences between sexes occurred in the measurements of cardiac contractility during the decompensation to HF. In females, there was a significant improvement in contractility compared with males, which was apparent in the load-independent measurements of preload recruitable stroke work (10 wk post-MI, female=48.7+/-8.0 vs. male=25.2+/-1.8 mmHg, P<0.05) and maximum dP/dt vs. maximum end-diastolic volume (10 wk post-MI, female=359+/-58 vs. male=149+/-28 mmHg.s(-1).microl(-1), P<0.05). Despite these differences, there were no differences in the heart weight to body weight ratio and infarct size between the sexes. These data demonstrate that compensatory hypertrophy is associated with an improvement in contractility and a delayed decompensation to HF in females. However, compensatory hypertrophy in males appears to be undermined by a steady decline in contractility associated with decompensation to HF."

Up to 50% of all transplant recipients carry this clinical diagnosis. Female-specific gene expression in IDCM has not been explored. We report sex-related differences in the gene expression profile of ventricular myocardium from patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. We produced and sequenced subtractive cDNA libraries, using human left ventricular myocardium obtained from male transplant recipients with IDCM and nonfailing human heart donors. With the resulting sequence data, we generated a custom human heart failure microarray for IDCM containing 1,145 cardiac-specific oligonucleotide probes. This array was used to characterize RNA samples from female IDCM transplant recipients. We identified a female gene expression pattern that consists of 37 upregulated genes and 18 downregulated genes associated with IDCM. Upon functional analysis of the gene expression pattern, deregulated genes unique to female IDCM were those that are involved in energy metabolism and regulation of transcription and translation. For male patients we found deregulation of genes related to muscular contraction. These data suggest that 1) the gene expression pattern we have detected for IDCM may be specific for this disease and 2) there is a sex-specific profile to IDCM. Our observations further suggest for the first time ever novel targets for treatment of IDCM in women and men."

Prevalent HF cases (n = 750) were identified by self-report and were excluded. Incident HF was defined by the International Classification of Diseases codes for HF (428.0 to 428.9, I50) from a hospitalization (n = 1,206) or death certificate (n = 76). There were 1,282 incident HF cases over 198,417 person-years.

Age-adjusted HF incidence rates were greater for African-Americans than Caucasians, but adjustment for confounders attenuated the difference. The adjusted African-American-to-Caucasian hazard ratio was 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.06) for men, and similarly, 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 1.90) for women during the second half of follow-up. The hazard ratio for women during the first half of follow-up was 1.79 (95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 2.55).

In conclusion, heart failure incidence rates in African-American women were more similar to those of men than of Caucasian women. The greater HF incidence in African-Americans than in Caucasians is largely explained by African-Americans' greater levels of atherosclerotic risk factors."

Major advances in the diagnosis and treatment of HF over the last two decades have proven effective in reducing morbidity and mortality among both men and women, but with less improvement for women and elderly patients. Women and men with HF differ in several respects. Women tend to be older and more often hypertensive, but are less likely to demonstrate any clinical evidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and more often have preserved ventricular function. Conversely, hypertension plays a greater role in the development of HF in women than in men. Sex differences in systolic and diastolic function in patients with hypertension have been demonstrated. Although men have higher incidence of HF at all ages, lifetime risk is similar in men and women because women live longer. Intervention studies have included far more men than women but in patients with reduced ventricular function there is no evidence to suggest that women benefit less than men from evidence-based treatments, and current guidelines do not differentiate between men and women. There is no consistent recent evidence that women receive poorer quality of care than men. Women with HF have better survival rates than men, which may be due to better systolic function or less CHD among women; however, mortality rates for HF are still very high regardless of sex. As most trials have been targeted towards patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which is less typical for women than for men with HF, more research is needed to help define treatment aimed at improving prognosis for patients with HF and preserved systolic function. In light of these differences and ongoing uncertainties, future European guidelines should incorporate gender issues. Heart Fail Monit 2008;6(1):34-40."

We hypothesize that estrogen prevents cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the development of CHF.17Beta-estradiol (E2, 0.5 mg/60-day release) or placebo pellet was implanted subcutaneously into male G alpha q transgenic (Gq) mice. After 8 weeks, E2 treatment decreased the extent of cardiac hypertrophy and dilation and improved contractility in Gq mice. E2 treatment also attenuated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity and superoxide anion production via downregulation of Rac1. This correlated with reduced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes of Gq mice. The antioxidative properties of E2 were also associated with increased expression of thioredoxin (Trx), Trx reductases, and Trx reductase activity in the hearts of Gq mice. Furthermore, the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 and its downstream effectors, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, in the hearts of Gq mice was reduced by long-term E2 treatment. Indeed, E2 (10 nmol/L)-treated cardiomyocytes were much more resistant to angiotensin II-induced apoptosis. These antiapoptotic and cardioprotective effects of E2 were blocked by an estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780) and by a Trx reductase inhibitor (azelaic acid).These findings indicate that long-term E2 treatment improves CHF by antioxidative mechanisms that involve the upregulation of Trx and inhibition of Rac1-mediated attenuated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 /c-Jun N-terminal kinase/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that estrogen may be a useful adjunctive therapy for patients with CHF."

Revue th√©rapeutique,2007 Jun,Review,Human,na,,"In cardiovascular diseases e.g. heart failure and coronary artery disease gender differences are evident in etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, prognosis and response to treatment. Diabetes and hypertension are the major risk factors in women. Mechanisms leading to apparent diabetes or its clinical pre-stage are different in women and men and according to this result in different therapeutic implications. Diastolic heart failure is more frequent in women and effects and side effects of important groups of active pharmaceutical substances are, at least to some extent, different. Atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmia differ in frequency of occurrence; drug induced tachycardia with QT interval prolongation is particularly frequent in women. Underlying pathomechanisms responsible for gender differences in pharmacotherapy are on the one hand differences in pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Particularly drugs which are metabolised via cytochrome P 450 CYP 3A pathway show different kinetics in women and men. In addition, important differences are evident in pharmocodynamics caused by effects of sex steroid hormones or products of X-chromosomal genes. The evidence of estrogen and testosterone receptors in cardiomyocytes and the vascular system, interaction of sex steroid hormones with cellular pathways and the role of X-chromosomal genes are the focus of basic research. Interactions of sex steroid hormone receptors with other nuclear receptors e.g. PPARs (""peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors"") are another important underlying mechanism. The knowledge of different pharmacokinetic mechanisms has to be taken into consideration in pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular diseases, for example by adjustment of drug dosages in women, necessary in different groups of pharmaceutical substances or in the long run, gender differences in effects and side effects of drugs. In drug development both aspects have to be considered. There is more than one good reason to intensify basic and clinical research and research on health care on gender differences in cardiovascular diseases."

By gender-specific linear regression analysis, higher osteoprotegerin levels were significantly associated with higher left ventricular mass, left ventricular wall thickness, left ventricular concentricity index, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (P<0.001 for all). After adjustment for age, race, fat-free mass, fat mass, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypercholesterolemia, smoking status, hormone replacement therapy, coronary artery calcium score >10, and presence of aortic plaque, osteoprotegerin remained significantly associated with each of these left ventricular indices among male subjects (P<0.05 for each). Among female subjects, higher osteoprotegerin was independently associated with higher left ventricular end-systolic volume and lower ejection fraction (P<0.0001 for each) but not with indices of left ventricular hypertrophy.

Both groups have reductions in exercise tolerance, neurohumoral activation, and abnormal left ventricular (LV) filling dynamics and impaired relaxation. Although the normal EF indicates that pump performance is adequately compensated, some of the patients with HF and a normal EF have reduced longitudinal systolic velocity indicating cardiac muscular contractile dysfunction. Regardless of EF, the severity of HF and its prognosis and degree of exercise intolerance are closely related to the degree of diastolic filling abnormalities. Patients with HF and a reduced EF have ventricular dilatation and elongated myocytes, whereas patients with HF and a normal EF do not. Thus, patients with HF have diastolic abnormalities regardless of EF and many patients with HF and a normal EF have contractile abnormalities despite preserved systolic pump performance. Heart failure with a normal EF and a reduced EF differs in the systolic LV pump performance and the type of remodeling. The mechanism of the differing remodeling responses is not known, but aging, sex differences, and diabetes may contribute."

However, the interaction of gender and age has rarely been analyzed in detail, and knowledge of the distinction between pre- and postmenopausal women is lacking. Some of the studies that have described a higher prevalence of HF-NEF in women relied on clinical diagnoses of HF together with normal systolic function and did not measure diastolic function. This applies to the analysis of patients hospitalized for HF and some epidemiological investigations that agree on the greater prevalence of HF-NEF in women. Population-based studies with echocardiographic determination of diastolic function have suggested equal or greater prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in men. Major risk factors for HF-NEF include hypertension, aging, obesity, diabetes, and ischemia. Hypertension is more frequent in women and can contribute to left ventricular and arterial stiffening in a gender-specific way. Aging, obesity, and diabetes affect myocardial and vascular stiffness differently and lead to different forms of myocardial hypertrophy in women and men. In contrast, ischemia may play a greater role in men. Gender differences in ventricular diastolic distensibility, in vascular stiffness and ventricular/vascular coupling, in skeletal muscle adaptation to HF, and in the perception of symptoms may contribute to a greater rate of HF-NEF in women. The underlying molecular mechanisms include gender differences in calcium handling, in the NO system, and in natriuretic peptides. Estrogen affects collagen synthesis and degradation and inhibits the renin-angiotensin system. Effects of estrogen may provide benefit to premenopausal women, and the loss of its protective mechanisms may render the heart of postmenopausal women more vulnerable. Thus, a number of molecular mechanisms can contribute to the gender differences in HF-NEF."

Sensitivity and specificity are essential in order for a biomarker to be useful. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are considered biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. However, they differ in function, sensitivity and specificity. BNP is released from the myocardium in response to myocardial stretch, a clear cause and effect relationship; therefore, it is useful in the diagnosis of heart failure when patients present with dyspnea of unknown origin and to assess treatment in high risk patients with diagnosed heart failure. Sex and age based reference ranges and partition values are established from clinical trials and from populations screened for the absence of cardiovascular disease. Highly sensitive and reproducible methods are also available to measure CRP. However, although CRP is associated with adverse cardiovascular events, unlike BNP, multiple stimuli increase production of CRP. Therefore, elevation in CRP is not specific to cardiovascular disease. Partition values for CRP and cardiovascular risk based on epidemiological studies predict risk for populations but may not always be useful when used alone to predict individual risk or to direct therapy. Given the non-specific stimuli which affect circulating concentrations of CRP, using CRP to monitor treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk may provide little benefit without understanding or targeting the underlying causes for its elevation."

At basal [Ca]o both MT and FT exhibited positive FFR (2.0 Hz, 1.75 mM Ca: MT 38 +/- 3, FT 21 +/- 4 mN/mm2); however, at higher [Ca]o, MT achieved greater DF (2.0 Hz, 7.0 mM Ca: MT 40 +/- 3 and FT = 24 +/- 4 mN/mm2). We detected no sex difference in myofilament Ca sensitivity at a sarcomere length of 2.1 mum. However, rapid cooling contractures indicated greater sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca load in MT at higher frequencies. Despite virtually identical contractile performance under basal conditions, significant sex differences emerge under conditions of increased physiological stress. Given the lack of sex differences in myofilament Ca sensitivity, these studies suggest fundamental sex differences in cellular Ca regulation to achieve contractile reserve, with myocardium from males exhibiting higher SR Ca load."

All patients had symptoms of heart failure and were examined by a cardiologist. An electrocardiogram and chest x-rays were taken, and the systolic and diastolic functions were assessed using Doppler echocardiography. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal proBNP, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and N-terminal proANP were analyzed. All 4 peptides were associated with age, and only 1 of them showed any gender difference. Three of the 4 peptides (not ANP) provided important information for identifying patients with impaired systolic function and diastolic dysfunction (pseudonormal or restrictive filling pattern), and for assessing the risk of cardiovascular death.Cardiac natriuretic peptides are useful tools for evaluating elderly patients with heart failure. Three of the 4 peptides were very similar. ANP exhibits inferior properties and cannot be recommended in clinical practice."

Hazard ratios (HR), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated by gender and etiology.A total of 18% of ischemic and 31% of nonischemic patients were women. Irrespective of etiology, women were older, more ethnically diverse, and had higher systolic blood pressures, more diabetes, and severe HF symptoms, but less often smoked or had prior myocardial infarctions than men. Mean ejection fractions were similar between women (23.6%) and men (23.2%). The 1-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimates varied by gender and etiology (female nonischemics, HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.85 to 0.89]; female ischemics, HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.81 to 0.85]; male nonischemics, HR 0.84 [95% CI 0.83 to 0.85]; male ischemics, HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.78 to 0.81]).

Mean follow-up was 40+/-19 months.Mean age was 68+/-12 years; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 27+/-12%. Women had higher mean LVEF, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and worse New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class at baseline compared to men, while age, body mass index, blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate and other co-morbidities did not differ significantly. Fewer women remained on angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors while angiotensin-II-receptor blockers use increased significantly. By the end of the study, both genders exhibited similar magnitude of improvements in LVEF, cardiac dimensions, hemodynamics and mean NYHA functional class. In multivariate analysis, NYHA functional class was the strongest predictor of mortality: patients with NYHA class III/IV at baseline had 2.4-fold increased mortality risk compared to those in NYHA class I/II (95% CI 1.09-5.51, p=0.03). For men, functional class at baseline was the strongest predictor of mortality while for women, it was age at baseline.In a contemporary tertiary referral heart failure clinic, women were observed to have better LVEF, but worse NYHA functional class than men. Both genders exhibited functional and hemodynamic improvements with only minor differences in their medical therapies. Predictors of mortality differed between the genders."

Women with HF had higher (7-days, 30-days, and 1-year) crude mortality rates than men. However, adjusted mortality rates were not significantly different between genders.Women with AMI complicated by HF had higher crude mortality rate than men that was eliminated after multivariate analysis, suggesting that the higher mortality rate may be attributed to increased prevalence of risk factors and lower rate of revascularization and medical therapies among women. Women with AMI and HF should be considered as a high-risk subgroup with adverse outcome. It remains to be determined whether more intensive management will improve their prognosis."

The researchers of this interpretive research encouraged the seven women who volunteered for this study to talk about their day-to-day challenges. The interviews were interpreted through a process informed by Heideggerian hermeneutics, whereby the three themes of recalibrating time and space, balancing pathways of wishing and hoping and practicality, and acknowledging loss in persevering through uncertainty were uncovered.

However, questions remain regarding the clinical benefit of these therapies in different patient subgroups. Since the majority of patients enrolled in device trials are white men, extrapolating the data to specific patient subpopulations becomes important. Specifically, the question of clinical outcomes in women with implantable device therapy for prevention of sudden cardiac death and management of heart failure is an important clinical issue. In this article, we review the data on survival and clinical outcomes with heart failure device therapy (implantable cardioverter defibrillators [ICDs] and cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT]) and analyze the results from clinical trials for any differences in outcomes based on gender. Even though women are a significantly under-represented population with regard to clinical investigation and utilization of heart failure devices, they still derive the same morbidity and mortality benefits compared to men. Specifically, ICD devices confer the same rates of sudden cardiac death prevention, and CRT devices improve CHF morbidity and mortality at rates comparable to those found in men. These results support equal use of ICDs and CRT in men and women."

Animals were followed for 26 weeks and compared to sham-operated groups. Heart function was evaluated in vivo using echocardiography, and the hearts were subsequently harvested for tissue analysis.The LV ejection fraction was decreased similarly in both sexes. Despite similar echocardiographic AR severity, females had higher indexed cardiac output and the largest increase in LV weight, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and eccentric remodeling. No differences were observed between control and OVX females. Ovariectomy had no significant impact on any of the parameters monitored.Female rats developed more LV remodeling in response to chronic AR than males. AR appears to impose a greater LV workload on females due to their smaller body and heart size. Hormonal status did not have any impact on LV remodeling in this experimental model."

These differences persisted for Hispanic women and men even when they presented with ESRD or diabetes. Rates for smoking cessation counseling were among the lowest among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics with AMI-diabetes and non-Hispanic blacks with AMI-hypertension/ESRD. Gender comparisons within racial groups for the AMI and AMI-diabetes groups show that among non-Hispanic Whites, women were less likely to receive aspirin and beta-blockers.

Women with MI were slightly less likely to receive aspirin and slightly more likely to receive ACE inhibitors. Among patients with equivocal indications, men were significantly more likely than women to undergo cardiac catheterization, whereas there were no sex differences among patients with strong indication. Women were more likely than men to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention and less likely to receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Short-term mortality rates after MI and readmission rates after heart failure did not vary significantly by gender; however, risk of mortality after heart failure was slightly lower for women.

Patients were taking oral digoxin (0.0625-0.25 mg, once a day) and were administered oral carvedilol (6.25 mg, two times daily) for 7 days.In the male group, carvedilol led to statistically significant increases in the area under the concentration time curve to 16 h (AUC(0-16h)) and the peak concentration (C(max)) for digoxin, with no change in time to peak (t(max))(AUC(0-16h)= 24.1+/-9.2 ng.h/ml vs. 15.4+/-5.8 ng.h/ml, p<0.001, C(max)=2.2+/-1.0 ng/ml vs. 1.6+/-0.6 ng/ml, p<0.01, t(max)=2.4+/-2.2 h vs. 2.1+/-1.0 h, p>0.05). In the female group, carvedilol administration did not cause statistically significant change in the AUC(0-16h), C(max), or t(max) for digoxin (p>0.05). In the male group, carvedilol resulted in a significant increase in the AUC(0-16h) and C(max) for digoxin compared with the female group (AUC(0-16h)=24.1+/- 9.2ng.h/ml vs. 17.0+/-6.8 ng.h/ml, C(max)=2.2+/-1.0 ng/ml vs. 1.5+/-0.6 ng/ml, p<0.05, respectively).Men seem to have a higher activity relative to women for the drug efflux transporter P-gp. Our results suggest that carvedilol will cause drug interaction with digoxin following the inhibition of P-gp-mediated transcellular transport of digoxin in males."

Daily doses were adjusted for patients' actual and ideal body weight and body mass index (BMI). The ratio between the serum digoxin concentration and each of the adjusted daily doses of digoxin was compared between men and women. The mean +/- SD serum digoxin concentration was 0.85 +/- 0.51 ng/ml for men compared with 1.02 +/- 0.51 ng/ml for women. Mean +/- SD unadjusted doses of digoxin were 0.180 +/- 0.063 and 0.164 +/- 0.059 mg/day for men and women, respectively; the difference was not statistically significant. Ratios of serum digoxin concentration to daily digoxin doses did not differ by sex when doses were estimated with actual or ideal weight. Only the ratio of the digoxin concentration to the BMI-adjusted dose was significantly different between men and women (0.14 +/- 0.09 and 0.19 +/- 0.11, respectively, p<0.05).Sex-based differences in digoxin pharmacokinetics were absent when actual or ideal body weight was used. However, the ratio of serum digoxin concentration to daily digoxin dose adjusted for BMI differed by sex. Because digoxin is distributed to lean body mass, use of the BMI could have overadjusted body weight, leading to inaccurate pharmacokinetic assumptions and calculations. The pharmacokinetics of digoxin do not appear to differ by sex."

Not much is known about the role of gender in the clinical presentation, symptoms, or disease severity of HF-PEF or about the contribution of these differences to gender differences in morbidity and mortality in patients with HF-PEF. This study examined gender differences in clinical presentation, hospitalization, and mortality in patients with HF-PEF (ejection fraction > or = 50%) enrolled in the ancillary arm of the Digitalis Investigation Group trial. Time-to-event analysis was performed using Cox proportional-hazards modeling. The study cohort included 719 patients (378 men, 341 women). At baseline, compared with men, women were older and had greater clinical severity of HF, as evidenced by worse New York Heart Association functional class, more frequent symptoms and signs of HF, and more treatment with diuretics. Ischemia was identified as the primary cause of HF in 46% of women and 56% of men (p = 0.01). During a median follow-up of 39 months, crude mortality was similar in women and men (24.6% and 24.3%, p = 0.93), but more women were hospitalized for HF (26.7% vs 15.9%, p <0.001). After adjustment for baseline differences, female gender was an independent predictor of lower mortality (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.82), but HF hospitalization rates were similar between men and women (hazard ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.53). In conclusion, although the clinical manifestations of HF appear to be more severe in women with HF-PEF, after adjustment for baseline clinical differences, HF hospitalizations are not increased and survival expectancy is better for women compared with men."

Clinical trials and long-standing perceptions of the typical heart failure patient have related far more to men than to women, while more women than men in the United States may be hospitalized with heart failure. The goal of this study was to analyze ADHERE Registry data, the largest database of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patient hospitalizations available, to gain insight into the effect of gender on medical history, clinical characteristics, and discharge counseling. This preliminary study analyzed the 85,617 ADHF hospitalizations in the ADHERE Registry as of October 2003, with 44,340 (52%) women and 41,276 (48%) men included. Women were significantly older (mean age 74.6 +/- 13.7 years) than men (mean age 70.2 +/- 13.9 years, P < .0001). Women were more likely to have a history of hypertension (75% vs. 69%, P < .0001) and a systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg (56% vs. 44%, P < .0001). History of coronary artery disease was more common in men (64% vs. 51%, P < .0001). Other risk factors for atherosclerosis, including smoking (17% vs. 10%, P < .0001) and hyperlipidemia (37% vs. 32%, P < .0001), were also more common in men. Men had a significantly lower mean left ventricular ejection fraction (32.9%, N = 30,831) than women (42.1%, N = 29,744); 51% of women had preserved left ventricular function (EF > 40%) compared to only 28% of men (P < 0.0001). At discharge, adherence to 3 of the 4 JCAHO standardized measures of quality of care far heart failure patients were documented more frequently for men than for women. A significantly smaller proportion of women received discharge instructions on management of diet, weight, and medications (30.1% vs. 32.8%); received or were scheduled for assessment of left ventricular function (81.5% vs. 85.6%); or were discharged with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor prescription if appropriate (72.6% vs. 73.9%). Real-world data from the ADHERE Registry may lead to better recognition of the signs and symptoms of heart failure in women, increase the proportion of women who are correctly diagnosed, and may help to support gender-specific considerations in heart failure guidelines."

It is less clear if sex differences are present among older persons with mild hypertension.One hundred seven healthy subjects, aged 55 to 75 years, with blood pressures ranging from 130 to 159 mm Hg systolic and/or 85 to 99 mm Hg diastolic, were examined by standard echocardiography and the newer modalities of tissue Doppler and color M-mode imaging.Women had a lower peak mitral annular systolic velocity (Sm), 8.9 (95% CI 8.4-9.5) cm/s versus 10.2 (95% CI 9.6-11.0) cm/s, (P < .01) than men. Among women, increasing age was associated with a reduction in diastolic function. For every decade of age, peak early mitral annular diastolic velocity (Em) declined by 1.6 cm/s (P < .01), mitral inflow velocity of propagation (Vp) declined by 26% (P < .01), E/Vp ratio increased by 20% (P = .03), and E/Em ratio increased by 11% (P = .04) in women. No age-associated changes were seen in men.As revealed by newer echocardiographic imaging modalities, women with mild hypertension showed greater reductions in systolic and diastolic function as they aged compared with men. Our findings are consistent with the increased risk older women have of developing heart failure because of hypertension."

The basis of these sex-related distinctions in cardiac electrophysiology has been extensively studied in various species, but is virtually unexplored in humans. The aim of this study was to clarify the cellular basis of electrophysiological gender disparities in human cardiac myocytes. Human midmyocardial left ventricular myocytes were isolated from explanted hearts of male and female patients in end-stage heart failure at the time of cardiac transplantation. The action potentials, sarcolemmal ion currents, and susceptibility to the generation of early afterdepolarizations were studied using whole-cell patch-clamp methodology. The functional effects of gender disparities in sarcolemmal ion currents were assessed by computer simulations using the Priebe-Beuckelmann or the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov human ventricular cell models. Female myocytes had significantly longer action potentials and greater susceptibility to early afterdepolarizations than male myocytes. All other action potential parameters (resting membrane potential, amplitude, plateau level, upstroke velocity, maximal velocity of phase-1 and phase-3 repolarization) had similar values for both genders. In female myocytes, the transient outward potassium current (I(to1)) tended to be smaller, while the L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) and quasi-steady state current (I(QSS)) tended to be larger. Computer simulations showed that these subtle differences in sarcolemmal ion currents may conspire to cause the observed gender disparities in action potential properties. Female failing myocytes have longer action potentials and a greater susceptibility to early afterdepolarizations than male failing myocytes. These gender disparities may be due to slightly larger depolarizing I(Ca,L) in conjunction with slightly smaller repolarizing I(QSS) and I(to1) in female myocytes."

The vast majority of women with advanced HF are elderly and many of them have HF with evidence of normal or preserved left ventricular systolic function. Although coronary disease is a common cause of HF for both men and women, a history of hypertension or diabetes places a woman at particular risk. Many fewer women than men have been enrolled in trials of therapies for patients with HF. Sex-specific results have been reported for some of these therapies, but not all trial data have been analyzed for sex-related differences. In spite of these differences in outcome, cardiac transplantation remains an important option for women with very advanced HF. Future research on therapies for HF will need to target women for enrollment, and all data analysis should include results that are stratified by sex."

Data were collected under resting conditions, and after the 6-minute walk test, in the general clinical research center of a northeastern university medical center.Basal plasma vasopressin (VP) concentration was significantly higher in men than in women (P = .018). Exercise, for women and men combined, significantly increased atrial natriuretic peptide (P < .0005), VP (P = .04), norepinephrine (P < .0005), and epinephrine (P = .038) but not plasma renin activity (P = .09). No further gender differences were detected for basal levels, or for the magnitude of exercise-induced increases, for any of the hormones measured.The 6-minute walk test is an exercise of sufficient intensity and duration to initiate the release of hormones associated with sympathetic activation and fluid-electrolyte regulation in both women and men with CHD.

Body, heart, and lung weights were measured 2 wk postsurgery. WT male mice subjected to TAC showed a 64% increase in the heart weight-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW) compared with sham, and WT males have increased lung weight at 2 wk. WT female mice subjected to TAC showed a 31% increase in HW/BW compared with sham, which was significantly less than their male counterparts and with no evidence of heart failure. alpha-ERKO females developed HW/BW nearly identical to that seen in WT littermate females in response to TAC, indicating that estrogen receptor-alpha is not essential for the attenuation of hypertrophy observed in WT females. In contrast, beta-ERKO females responded to TAC with a significantly greater increase in HW/BW than WT littermate females. beta-ERKO females have lower expression of lipoprotein lipase at baseline than WT or alpha-ERKO females.

The relationship of BNP to blood pressure, blood haemoglobin, serum cholesterol (total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), plasma glucose, electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, urinary salt excretion, and lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol consumption) were cross-sectionally analysed. The plasma BNP geometric mean was 13.7 pg/ml. Both linear and logistic regression analyses indicated that the plasma BNP levels were positively associated with age, urinary salt excretion, higher blood pressure, high R-wave voltage in the 12-lead ECG (Minnesota Code 3-1 or 3-3), and female gender.

Role of hypertension, diabetes, and estrogen.",Herz,2005 Aug,Review,Human,,,"Large differences exist between women and men in the syndrome of heart failure (HF). In contrast to men, hypertension and diabetes represent the major risk factors for development of HF in women and hypertension is also the major cause of left ventricular hypertrophy and stroke. Left ventricular hypertrophy in women increases the risk for mortality to a higher degree than it does in men. The clinical course of HF is generally more benign and more frequently characterized by HF with preserved systolic function. Estrogen receptors are present in the human heart. Based on data from rodent models, they are believed to modulate hypertrophy and the progression of HF. Some of the signaling pathways have been described and involve phosphorylation of intracellular kinases and production of nitric oxide. Interestingly, estrogen receptors are upregulated in human hypertrophy and HF. The clinical course of HF in women is characterized by the more frequent occurrence of diastolic HF. Myocardial remodeling with age and, as a consequence, of mechanical load is different in both genders. Adherence to guidelines in the diagnosis and treatment of HF is less strict in women than in men, leading to undertreatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Women are generally underrepresented in clinical trials in HF and gender-specific analyses have been neglected in most older large survival trials.

Myocellular Ca(2+) cycling regulates normal contractile function; whereas cardiac dysfunction in heart failure has been associated with alterations in Ca(2+)-handling proteins. Beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) signaling regulates activity of several Ca(2+)-handling proteins and alterations in beta-AR signaling are associated with heart disease. This study examines sex differences in expression of beta(1)-AR, beta(2)-AR, and Ca(2+)-handling proteins including: L-type calcium channel (Ca(v)1.2) , ryanodine calcium-release channels (RyR), sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA2), phospholamban (PLB) and Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange protein (NCX) in healthy hearts from male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Protein levels were examined using Western blot analysis. Abundance of mRNA was determined by real time RT-PCR normalized to abundance of GAPDH mRNA. Contraction parameters were measured in right ventricular papillary muscle in the presence and absence of isoproterenol. Results demonstrate that female ventricle has significantly higher levels of Ca(v)1.2, RyR, and NCX protein compared to males. Messenger RNA abundance for RyR, and NCX protein was significantly higher in females whereas Ca(v)1.2 mRNA was higher in males. No differences were detected in beta-ARs, SERCA2 or PLB. Female right papillary muscle had a faster maximal rate of force development and decline (+/- dF/dt). There were no sex differences in response to isoproterenol. Results show significant sex differences in expression of key ventricular Ca(2+)-handling proteins that are associated with small functional differences in +/- dF/dt. Further studies will determine whether differences in the abundance of these key proteins play a role in sex disparities in the incidence and manifestation of heart disease."

Mutations in cardiac troponin T, which binds the calcium-responsive troponin complex to alpha-tropomyosin, have been shown to result in cardiac hypertrophy or cardiac dilatation and heart failure, depending on the nature of the specific mutation. In this study, we report the identification of a novel cardiac troponin T mutation (A171S) leading to dilated cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death. In contrast to prior described mutations, the A171S mutation results in a significant gender difference in the severity of the observed phenotype with adult males (over 20 years of age) demonstrating more severe ventricular dilatation [left ventricular end diastolic dimension (LVEDD) 7.1 vs. 5.1cm; P=0.01, t test] and left ventricular dysfunction [left ventricular shortening fraction (LVSF) 21 vs. 34%; P=0.04, t test] than adult females. The described mutation substitutes a hydrophilic amino acid for a hydrophobic one in a highly conserved domain involved in the interaction between troponin T and alpha-tropomyosin. Interestingly, four previously described mutations within 12 amino acids of A171 lead to a hypertrophic phenotype, suggesting that further characterization of the functional consequences of the A171S mutation may lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and of the functional differences between HCM- and DCM-causing mutations in cardiac troponin T."

Pathophysiology and medical therapy.,Archives des maladies du coeur et des vaisseaux,2004 Sep,Review,Human,na,,"Gender differences in the syndrome of heart failure (HF) occur in etiology and pathophysiology and lead to differences in the clinical presentation and course of the syndrome. In addition, gender specific treatment responses and gender associated differences in the behavior of treating physicians are found. Hypertension and diabetes play a major role as causes of HF in women and both interact in their pathophysiology with the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Modulation of the RAS by estrogens explains specific differences between pre- and post-menopausal women and men. Myocardial growth processes and myocardial calcium handling are differentially regulated in female and male myocytes. Myocardial remodeling with age and as a consequence of mechanical load differs in women and men. For yet unknown reasons, HF with preserved systolic function seems to be more frequent in women than in men and the clinical course of systolic HF is different in both genders. Medical therapy in heart failure has usually not been specified according to gender and gender specific analysis has been neglected in most large survival trials. Only a post-hoc analysis of gender differences led to the recognition of increased mortality with digitalis therapy in women. Single studies on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or beta-receptor blockers did not reach significant end points in women whereas meta-analyses showed overall positive effects. Side effects of ACEI are more common and pharmacokinetics of beta-blockers are different in women. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are equally well tolerated in women and men. RAS inhibition may be particularly advantageous in postmenopausal women in whom the natural modulation of the RAS by estrogens is lost."

We hypothesized that aldosterone influences ventricular remodeling in people without congestive heart failure in the community. We examined the relations between serum aldosterone and echocardiographic left ventricular measurements in 2820 Framingham Study subjects (mean age 57 years, 58% women, 88% white) free of myocardial infarction and overt heart failure. Serum aldosterone levels were higher in women compared with men. In linear regression models (adjusted for age, systolic blood pressure, weight, height, diabetes, heart rate, hypertension treatment, and ethnicity), left ventricular wall thickness and relative wall thickness were positively related, and left ventricular diastolic dimensions were inversely related to serum aldosterone in women (P<0.05 for all), but not in men (P>0.20 for all). There was no effect modification of the relations observed in women by menopausal status. The gender-related differences in relations of serum aldosterone to relative wall thickness were consistent across subgroups defined on the basis of sex-specific median values of systolic blood pressure and body mass index. Fractional shortening, left ventricular mass, and left atrial dimensions were not related to serum aldosterone in either sex. In conclusion, in our community-based sample of individuals free of myocardial infarction and heart failure, serum aldosterone was positively associated with a left ventricular geometric pattern suggestive of concentric remodeling (increased left ventricular wall thickness and relative wall thickness but decreased internal dimensions) in women but not in men. Additional investigations are warranted to confirm these findings."

After a 24-hr fast, blood was obtained for measurement of platelet phospholipid omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) PUFA. Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was measured by whole-blood impedance aggregometry. Obese male (OM) SHHF had significantly more platelet arachidonic acid (AA) and total n-6 PUFA than lean males (LMs), lean females (LFs), or obese females (OFs). Platelet aggregation was enhanced in males compared to females, with OMs by 45% compared to OFs and with LMs by 28% compared to LFs. Though no difference was found between OFs and LFs, platelet aggregation was increased in OMs by 20% compared to LMs. Though not significantly different, lag time to initiate platelet aggregation tended to be shortest in OMs and then, in increasing duration, LMs, LFs, and OFs, suggesting that platelets from male rats were quicker to aggregate than those from females. Platelet aggregation was correlated with platelet AA and total n-6 PUFA content. There was no relationship between n-3 PUFA and platelet aggregation. In SHHF rats, elevated AA and n-6 PUFA levels in platelets are associated with enhanced platelet aggregation. This relationship is potentiated by obesity and male sex."

Before age 50, men are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease than age-matched women. In the current studies, we found that cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were significantly more pronounced in males compared with females of guanylyl cyclase-A knockout (GC-A KO) mice at 16 wk of age. These gender-related differences were not seen in wild-type mice. In the further studies, either castration (at 10 wk of age) or flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, markedly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in male GC-A KO mice without blood pressure change. In contrast, ovariectomy (at 10 wk of age) had little effect. Also, chronic testosterone infusion increased cardiac mass and fibrosis in ovariectomized GC-A mice. None of the treatments affected cardiac mass or the extent of fibrosis in wild-type mice. Overexpression of mRNAs encoding atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, collagens I and III, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta3, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin converting enzyme in the ventricles of male GC-A KO mice was substantially decreased by castration. The gender differences were virtually abolished by targeted deletion of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor gene (AT1A). Neither castration nor testosterone administration induced any change in the cardiac phenotypes of double-KO mice for GC-A and AT1A. Thus, we suggest that androgens contribute to gender-related differences in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis by a mechanism involving AT1A receptors and GC-A."

Second, sex differences exist in relation to living with CHF with men being more accepting of CHF and more likely to experience social isolation and loss than women, while women are more likely to describe fear. Third, the experience of CHF is influenced by age with physical experiences and depression mentioned more frequently in younger age groups.

Echocardiography demonstrated progressive left ventricular (LV) dilatation and reduction in LV fractional shortening in male but much less marked changes in female TG mice. Incidences of atrial thrombosis, pleural effusion and lung congestion were higher and myocyte size and fibrosis in the LV were greater in TG males than females. Deprivation of testicular hormones by castration during 3-15 mo of age improved survival and significantly ameliorated LV dysfunction, remodeling, and hypertrophy compared with intact TG males. No significant effect, except for a trend of a better survival, was detected by ovariectomy in TG females. In conclusion, cardiac beta(2)-AR overexpression at a high level leads to cardiomyopathy and heart failure with aging. Female mice had less cardiac remodeling, dysfunction, and pathology and a marked survival advantage over male mice, and this was independent of prevailing levels of ovarian hormones. TG males showed benefit from orchiectomy, suggesting a contribution by testicular hormones to the progression of the cardiomyopathic phenotype."

Accordingly, this study sought to determine the contribution of ovarian hormones to the prevention of adverse ventricular remodeling and congestive heart failure in chronic volume overload (i.e. aortocaval fistula in intact or ovariectomized female rats). Ovariectomized rats developed more extensive cardiac remodeling than intact females at 21 weeks post-fistula, characterized by significantly greater left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (167 vs. 86%, respectively, p < 0.05) and a substantial increase in LV dilatation (71%, p < 0.05) relative to control. In contrast to the eccentric hypertrophy in ovariectomized females post-fistula, the hypertrophic response in the intact female hearts was essentially concentric. While neither fistula group suffered significant mortality, there was a marked increase in the lung weight of ovariectomized rats (87%, p < 0.05) consistent with the development of pulmonary edema. Overall, the extent of myocardial remodeling and decrease in LV function in the ovariectomized females was comparable to those changes reported for males with symptomatic heart failure, while intact females maintained chronic compensated ventricular function similar to that of controls. The marked ventricular dilatation and symptoms of congestive heart failure seen at 21 weeks post-fistula in the ovariectomized females clearly demonstrate the influence of circulating ovarian hormones on the pattern of myocardial remodeling resulting from a chronic volume overload."

Important differences in presentation and mortality explain gender differences in the clinical course of heart failure. Overall mortality is lower for women than for men with symptomatic heart failure. Some but not all of this difference can be explained by a lower rate of ischemic heart disease. Standard treatments for congestive heart failure, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, have been shown to be equally efficacious in men and in women. Preliminary data on angiotensin II receptor blockers suggests equivalent benefit with further trial data awaited.

We find that most HF-candidate genes (transcription factors, Cebpb, Npat; signaling molecules, Map2k3, Map4k5; extracellular matrix proteins, Lum, Cola1; and metabolic enzymes, Mars) demonstrated significant changes in gene expression; however, the majority of differences among samples depended on variables such as sex and age, and not on HF alone. Some HF-responsive gene products also demonstrated highly significant changes in expression as a function of age and/or sex, but independent of HF (Ngp1, Cd163, and Npat). These results emphasize the need to account for biological variables (HF, sex and age interactions) to elucidate genomic correlates that trigger molecular pathways responsible for the progression of HF syndromes."

Heart and circulatory physiology,2003 Mar,Pathophysiology,Mouse,na,,"Transgenic (TG) TNF1.6 mice, which cardiac specifically overexpress tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), exhibit heart failure (HF) and increased mortality, which is markedly higher in young (<20 wk) males (TG-M) than females (TG-F). HF in this model may be partly caused by remodeling of the extracellular matrix and/or structure/function alterations at the single myocyte level. We studied left ventricular (LV) structure and function using echocardiography and LV myocyte morphometry, contractile function, and intracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(i)(2+)) handling using cell edge detection and fura 2 fluorescence, respectively, in 12-wk-old TG-M and TG-F mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates. TG-F mice showed LV hypertrophy without dilatation and only a small reduction of basal fractional shortening (FS) and response to isoproterenol (Iso). TG-M mice showed a large LV dilatation, higher mRNA levels of beta-myosin heavy chain and atrial natriuretic factor versus TG-F mice, reduced FS relative to both WT and TG-F mice, and minimal response to Iso. TG-F and TG-M myocytes were similarly elongated (by approximately 20%). The amplitude of Ca(i)(2+) transients and contractions and the response to Iso were comparable in WT and TG-F myocytes, whereas the time to 50% decline (TD(50%)) of the Ca(i)(2+) transient, an index of the rate of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) uptake, was prolonged in TG-F myocytes. In TG-M myocytes, the amplitudes of Ca(i)(2+) transients and contractions were reduced, TD(50%) of the Ca(i)(2+) transient was prolonged, and the inotropic effect of Iso on Ca(i)(2+) transients was reduced approximately twofold versus WT myocytes. Protein expression of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 2 and phospholamban was unaltered in TG versus WT hearts, suggesting functional origins of impaired Ca(2+) handling in the former. These results indicate that cardiac-specific overexpression of TNF-alpha induces myocyte hypertrophy and gender-dependent alterations in Ca(i)(2+) handling and contractile function, which may at least partly account for changes in LV geometry and in vivo cardiac function in this model."

We also evaluated the relations of insulin resistance (homeostasis model, HOMA-IR) and LV and left atrial (LA) measures within the normal and abnormal glucose tolerance categories (the latter included impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and newly diagnosed diabetes). LV mass (adjusted for age, height, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure) increased across categories of worsening glucose tolerance; the trend was more striking in women (P<0.001) compared with men (P=0.054). In subjects with normal (n=2022) and abnormal glucose tolerance (n=327), covariate-adjusted LV mass and LV wall thickness increased across HOMA-IR quartiles in women (P<0.001) but not men. In contrast, covariate-adjusted LA size increased with worsening glucose tolerance and across HOMA-IR quartiles in the normal and abnormal glucose tolerance groups in both sexes. Adjustment for body mass index considerably attenuated the relations of LV/LA measures and HOMA-IR, rendering them statistically nonsignificant in the normal glucose tolerance group.In our large community-based sample, LV mass and wall thickness increased with worsening glucose intolerance, an effect that was more striking in women compared with men. Insulin resistance was associated with increased LV mass in women alone, but this relation was largely accounted for by obesity."

This observation may be related to gender differences in cardiac remodeling.We studied hearts from 100 patients (72 men and 28 women) receiving cardiac transplantation at our institution. Cardiac morphology was assessed with echocardiography and direct measurement of cardiac mass. Cardiac myocyte volume, length, width, cross-sectional area, and contraction were measured using previously validated techniques.Among 50 patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM), we observed no gender-based differences in cardiac or cellular remodeling. In contrast, among 50 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), the heart weight index was significantly greater in men, and there was a strong trend toward an increased left ventricular (LV) mass index as well. These gender differences in cardiac and LV mass were paralleled by marked gender differences in myocyte volume, such that average myocyte volume was 36% greater in men than in women, in association with a 14% increase in resting cell length.Our studies demonstrate a multilevel gender difference in post-infarction remodeling, with women exhibiting reduced hypertrophy. Our studies further demonstrate that gender differences in cardiac remodeling in ICM are largely related to fundamental differences in cellular remodeling rather than simply differences in infarct size or expansion. Distinctions observed between ischemic and idiopathic CM suggest that gender may influence local myocardial responses to injury."

Scores on the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire were compared at baseline and 3 months after enrollment using multivariate techniques with ejection fraction controlled. Treatment group (intervention versus control) was controlled statistically at 3 months because the original data were drawn from experimental and quasi-experimental studies in which an improvement in quality of life had been a goal of the intervention. The sexes differed on marital status, so this variable was controlled in analyses as well.In all analyses, quality of life was minimally worse in women compared with men (1-3 points at most). None of the differences reached statistical significance except for emotional quality of life at baseline (P =.03). By 3 months, both men and women reported significantly improved and comparable quality of life and there were no significant differences between them.Quality of life is similar in men and women with heart failure when functional status, age, ejection fraction, and marital status differences are controlled."

Women (n = 593) were compared with men (n = 2,115). Mean follow-up period was two years.Significant differences in baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were found. Women were younger, more likely to be black, had a higher prevalence of nonischemic etiology, higher right and left ventricular ejection fraction, higher heart rate, greater cardiothoracic ratio, higher prevalence of left bundle branch block, lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation, and lower plasma norepinephrine level. Ischemic etiology and measures of severity of HF were found to be predictors of prognosis in women and men. However, differences in the predictive values of various variables were noted; most notably, coronary artery disease and LVEF appear to be stronger predictors of prognosis in women. In the nonischemic patients, women had a significantly better survival rate compared with men.In HF patients with impaired LVEF, significant gender differences are present, and the prognostic predictive values of some variables vary in magnitude between women and men.

We hypothesized that induction of hyperthyroidism should accelerate development of heart failure in male SHHF rats. Male and female SHHF rats received diets containing desiccated thyroid glands (DTG) or a control diet for 8 wk. Male and female Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as normotensive controls. DTG treatment reduced body weight in male, but not female, SHHF rats but increased body temperature and heart weight-to-body weight ratio in both genders. In DTG-treated male SHHF rats, serum triiodothyronine levels doubled relative to SHHF controls, whereas O2 consumption increased in DTG-treated SHHF rats. Frequency of breathing in air increased in DTG-treated female rats, and ventilation increased in DTG-treated male rats. Ventilatory equivalents exhibited gender differences in SHHF rats, were decreased in both genders by DTG treatment, and reached levels similar to those of Wistar-Kyoto rats. DTG increased heart rate, right ventricular pressure, and contractility in both genders and increased left ventricular pressure in SHHF male rats. These results refute our hypothesis and suggest that cardiopulmonary function of SHHF male rats may be improved by DTG treatment."

Recent evidence suggests an interaction with the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), which is activated in HF and modulates myocardial protein expression. It is unknown whether this peptide has an endocrine/paracrine role in man. We hypothesized that it may have a role in HF and would be raised in plasma.We developed a competitive binding assay specific for human myotrophin. Myotrophin was measured in plasma extracts of 120 HF patients and 130 age- and gender-matched normal controls.Myotrophin in plasma existed as the full-length 12 kD form with also a 2.7 kD form (possibly a degradation product). Log normalized myotrophin levels were significantly elevated in HF patients (mean +/- SEM [geometric mean, range], 2.402 +/- 0.021 [252, 72 to 933] vs. 2.268 +/- 0.021 [185, 28 to 501] fmol/ml, p < 0.0005). There was no relationship between myotrophin and age or gender in controls. However, males with HF had higher levels of myotrophin than females (p < 0.001). There was an inverse relationship of myotrophin levels with New York Heart Association class in patients with no gender difference in the relationship.There is evidence of early activation of the myotrophin system in HF, which is more evident in males. This response is attenuated in more severe disease. The contribution of myotrophin to NFkappaB-mediated gene transcription and preservation of cardiac muscle mass remains to be investigated further."

Age adjusted hospital admission rates for congestive heart failure increased by 38% (from 85.4 per 10 000 in 1991 to 110.3 per 10 000 in 1998), while mortality decreased by 20% (from 7.3 per 10 000 in 1991 to 6.1 per 10 000 in 1998). The decline in mortality was greater in women than in men. There were no sex differences in the rates of hospital admission, but there were significant ethnic differences in admissions and mortality. Thus hospital admissions for congestive heart failure were about 35% higher in both Malays and Indians than in Chinese; and mortality was 3.5 times higher in Malays, but was about the same in Indians and Chinese. Over the period studied, mortality from congestive heart failure declined in both Chinese and Indians, but rose in Malays. The increases in hospital admissions were similar in both sexes and all ethnic groups.An increasing rate of hospital admission accompanied by declining mortality from congestive heart failure is occurring in elderly people in this Asian multiethnic population.

One cardiologist evaluated the patients in terms of history, physical examination, functional capacity, electrocardiography, and suspicion of heart failure. Plasma N-terminal proBNP was measured by an in-house RIA. An ejection fraction < or =40% by Doppler echocardiography was regarded as reduced cardiac function. Abnormal diastolic function was defined as an abnormal mitral inflow defined as reduced ratio of peak early diastolic filling velocity to peak filling velocity at atrial contraction (E/A ratio), or as abnormal pulmonary venous flow pattern.Patients with impaired functional capacity, impaired systolic function, and/or impaired renal function had significantly increased N-terminal proBNP concentrations. By multiple regression analysis, N-terminal proBNP concentrations were also influenced by ischemic heart disease, cardiac enlargement, and certain medications but not by increased creatinine. No gender differences were observed. Patients with isolated diastolic dysfunction attributable to relaxation abnormalities had lower concentrations than those with normal cardiac function, whereas those with pseudonormal E/A ratios or restrictive filling patterns had higher concentrations.Plasma N-terminal proBNP concentrations increase as a result of impaired systolic function, age, impaired renal function, cardiac ischemia and enlargement, and certain medications. Values are high in diastolic dysfunction with pseudonormal patterns, but not in patients with relaxation abnormalities. An increase in plasma N-terminal proBNP might be an earlier sign of abnormal cardiac function than abnormalities identified by currently used echocardiographic measurements."

We have overexpressed platelet-derived growth factor-C in the heart using the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter and created a transgenic mouse that exhibits cardiac fibrosis followed by hypertrophy with sex-dependent phenotypes. The transgenic mice developed several pathological changes including cardiac fibroblast proliferation and deposition of collagen, hypertrophy, vascular defects, and the presence of Anitschkow cells in the adult myocardium. Male mice developed a hypertrophic phenotype, whereas female mice were more severely affected and developed dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to heart failure and sudden death. The vascular defects initially included dilation of microvessels and vascular leakage. Subsequently, a marked loss of microvessels, formation of large vascular sac-like structures, and an increased density of smooth muscle-coated vessels were observed in the myocardium. In part, the observed vascular changes may be because of an up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor in cardiac fibroblasts of the transgenic hearts. This unique animal model reveals that a potent mitogen for cardiac fibroblasts result in an expansion of the interstitium that induce a secondary sex-dependent hypertrophic response in the cardiomyocytes."

In MEDLINE, 234 abstracts dealing with heart failure and gender/sex were found and in CINAHL, 20 abstracts.Men have a higher incidence of heart failure, but the overall prevalence rate is similar in both sexes, since women survive longer after the onset of heart failure. Women tend to be older when diagnosed with heart failure and more often have diastolic dysfunction than men. The extent of sex differences in treatment, hospital cost and quality of care can partly be explained by age differences. The life situations for men and women with heart failure are different. Physical and social restrictions affecting daily life activities are experienced as most bothersome for men, whereas restrictions affecting the possibility to support family and friends are most difficult to accept for women. Women with heart failure ascribe more positive meanings to their illness. Despite this, women seem to experience a lower overall quality of life than men.

With increased sodium excretion and obesity, the hazard ratios for cardiovascular mortality were higher in women. A post-hoc subgroup analysis of the DIG study was conducted to assess potential sex-based differences in the effect of digoxin. The authors conclude that digoxin therapy is associated with an increased risk of death in women (P = 0.34). The comparison of the effects of digoxin was limited simply to gender only and no other subgroup analyses were preformed although the characteristics of the patients show significant differences in more than 20 parameters. Hence, the conclusion of these authors can hardly be accepted. Contrary to these partly conflicting data, the primary results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial focused on defining the risks and benefits of hormone replacement in postmenopausal women give an unambiguous answer: combined estrogen/progestin therapy should not be initiated or continued for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease, furthermore, it increases the risks of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, venous thromboembolism and biliary tract surgery."

We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the profile and management of patients with CHF at a tertiary care centre to determine if a gender difference exists.A chart review was performed at a tertiary care centre on consecutive patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of CHF between June 1997 and 1998. Co-morbidity, diagnostic investigations, and management of CHF were recorded. Comparisons between male and female patients were conducted.One hundred and forty five patients were reviewed. There were 80 male (M) and 65 female (F) patients of similar age [71.6 vs. 71.3 (M vs. F), p = NS]. Male patients were more likely to have had a previous myocardial infarction (66% vs. 35%, p < 0.01) and revascularization (41% vs. 20%, p < 0.05), and had worse left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) than women, [median LVEF 3 vs. 2 (M vs. F), p < 0.01]. Male patients were more likely to have a non-invasive assessment of left ventricular (LV) function [85% vs. 69%, (M vs. F), p < 0.05]. A logistic regression analysis suggests that amongst those without coronary disease, males were more likely to receive non-invasive testing. There were no differences in the use of prescribed medications, in this cohort.This pilot study demonstrated that there seem to be important gender differences in the profile and management of patients with CHF. Importantly women were less likely to have an evaluation of LV function. As assessment of LV function has significant implications on patient management, this data justifies the need for larger studies to assess gender differences in CHF profile and treatment."

Patients included in these landmark trials were predominantly men whose age was 10-15 years younger than the average age of patients with chronic HF in the United States. Diastolic dysfunction resulting in impaired left ventricular (LV) filling is the preponderant LV functional alteration that leads to chronic HF in elderly women. Gender differences in the LV remodeling process that accompanies chronic cardiac pressure are likely to be responsible for the preponderance of LV diastolic dysfunction over systolic dysfunction in elderly women. In response to chronic pressure overload, the LV wall becomes thicker in women than in men. Consequently, in response to chronic pressure overload, women are able to normalize LV wall stress and preserve LV systolic function to a greater extent than men. However, impaired LV filling is an undesirable consequence of the greater increase in LV wall thickness in women. Thus, clinical observations and therapeutic guidelines derived from data collected in the landmark trials of chronic HF may not apply to elderly women with chronic HF. In view of the lack of evidence-based information needed to guide the management of elderly women with chronic HF, special attention should be given to include a substantial number of elderly women in future therapeutic trials recruiting patients with chronic HF."

Diuretics were more frequent for females (p = 0.016) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for males (p < 0.001).Heart failure was common among the elderly and constituted a complex clinical problem. It seemed that these patients could have been managed more adequately. There were gender differences concerning comorbidity and management. Electronic patient records were feasible for research, although several areas needed improvement."

Even though the epidemiologic features, causes, and prognosis of heart failure vary between men and women, sex-based differences in the effect of digoxin were not evaluated.We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis to assess whether there were sex-based differences in the effect of digoxin therapy among the 6800 patients in the Digitalis Investigation Group study. The presence of an interaction between sex and digoxin therapy with respect to the primary end point of death from any cause was evaluated with the use of Mantel-Haenszel tests of heterogeneity and a multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model, adjusted for demographic and clinical variables.There was an absolute difference of 5.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 11.1) between men and women in the effect of digoxin on the rate of death from any cause (P=0.034 for the interaction). Specifically, women who were randomly assigned to digoxin had a higher rate of death than women who were randomly assigned to placebo (33.1 percent vs. 28.9 percent; absolute difference, 4.2 percent, 95 percent confidence interval, -0.5 to 8.8). In contrast, the rate of death was similar among men randomly assigned to digoxin and men randomly assigned to placebo (35.2 percent vs. 36.9 percent; absolute difference, -1.6 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -4.2 to 1.0). In the multivariable analysis, digoxin was associated with a significantly higher risk of death among women (adjusted hazard ratio for the comparison with placebo, 1.23; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.47), but it had no significant effect among men (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.02; P=0.014 for the interaction).The effect of digoxin therapy differs between men and women. Digoxin therapy is associated with an increased risk of death from any cause among women, but not men, with heart failure and depressed left ventricular systolic function."

Caregivers were 59.5 +/- 17.6 years, predominantly females (70.9%) and spouses of patients with HF (82.6%). Patients had significantly lower (poorer) emotional well-being scores than caregivers. Both gender and age were associated with patients' emotional well-being; male and younger participants had higher (better) scores than female and older patients (P <.05). In a multivariate model, patient's age, gender, and caregivers' emotional well-being accounted for 54% of the variance in patients' emotional well-being.We found that the emotional well-being of caregivers is associated with the emotional well-being of HF patients. Our findings suggest the need to focus on supporting caregivers and providing them with the strategies they need to support their loved ones with HF."

Accordingly, Doppler echocardiograms were analyzed in 515 male and 839 female, mostly treated (95%) hypertensive participants enrolled in the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) study with no evidence of abnormal wall motion or significant valvular heart disease. There was no difference in age between genders, but after adjusting for age and race, men had lower body mass indexes (29.8 +/- 5.2 vs 32.3 +/- 7.6 kg/m(2)) and heart rates (67 +/- 12 vs 69 +/- 11 beats/min) and higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) than women (134 +/- 20 vs 130 +/- 21 and 80 +/- 11 vs 72 +/- 11 mm Hg, all p <0.001). LV mass/height(2.7) was slightly greater in women than in men (43 +/- 10 vs 42 +/- 9 g/m(2.7), p <0.05). After adjusting for age, race, systolic BP, body mass index, heart rate, and LV hypertrophy, both mitral E-wave (70 +/- 18 vs 77 +/- 19) and A-wave (74 +/- 15 vs 79 +/- 17, both p <0.001) velocities were lower in men than in women, but the mitral E/A ratio and atrial filling fraction were nearly identical in both genders. Deceleration time (221 +/- 55 vs 214 +/- 46 cm/s, p = 0.018) and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) were longer in men than in women (85 +/- 18 vs 81 +/- 17 cm/s, p <0.001). Prolonged IVRT was present in more men than women (14% vs 7%, p <0.05). In analyses of covariance, adjusting for age, race, systolic BP, body mass index, heart rate, and medications, male gender remained related to prolonged deceleration time and IVRT. Thus, in this population-based sample of hypertensive adults, men had evidence of slower early diastolic LV filling than women. This gender difference in diastolic function may provide insight into gender differences in congestive heart failure and other specific cardiovascular diseases."

This role difference was greater for men than for women, and a gender difference (more distress in women than men) was greater for spouses than for patients. The patient's distress, but not the spouse's, reflected the severity of the patient's illness, and distress for both partners correlated negatively with ratings of marital quality. Female-patient couples reported better relationship quality than male-patient couples, however, and a mediation analysis indicated that the gender difference in spouse distress could be explained by marital quality.

Male and female spontaneous hypertension heart failure (SHHF) rats with established hypertension, but before CHF (age 5-8 mo) and during cardiac decompensation leading to CHF (age 18-20 mo in male rats and 22-24 mo in female rats), were studied. At 5-8 mo, male SHHF rats showed early activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), as indicated by increased plasma renin activity (PRA) and higher serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity compared with female rats. The increase in PRA in female rats was delayed compared with males rats, but it reached comparable levels just before CHF. Urinary endothelin excretion was significantly greater in 5- to 8-mo-old female rats compared with age-matched male rats. Urinary endothelin excretion increased in both male and female rats as CHF developed. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was comparable at both time points, and both genders showed similar, marked increases as CHF developed. In conclusion, male rats show early activation of the RAS, whereas female rats show early activation of the endothelin vasopressor system. During cardiac decompensation, generalized activation of the RAS, endothelin, and ANP systems occurs and is similar in male and female SHHF rats."
11861038,Yes," Marcus Fischer, Heribert Schunkert",Renin angiotensin system and gender differences in the cardiovascular system.,Cardiovascular research,2002 Feb 15,Review,M/R/H,na,,"In the effort to explain gender-related differences of the cardiovascular system, the renin-angiotensin system experienced intensive exploration. Indeed, the development of hypertension as well as the progression of coronary artery disease and heart failure have two factors in common: (1) display distinct gender specific characteristics and (2) are enhanced by the renin-angiotensin system. It is therefore interesting to note that data from experimental animals, epidemiological surveys, and clinical investigations suggest that the components of the circulating as well as tissue-based renin-angiotensin system are markedly affected by gender. However, the issue is complicated by counter-regulatory effects of estrogen on the system with the substrate, on one hand, and the processing enzymes as well as the chief receptor, on the other hand. In fact, angiotensinogen is up-regulated particularly by oral administration of estrogen, whereas renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and AT-1 receptor are down-regulated by the hormone. While under well-defined experimental conditions the net effect of estrogen appears to result in suppression of the renin-angiotensin system, the clinical situation may be more complex. The judgment is further complicated by the difficulty in precisely measuring the activity of the system at the tissue level. Moreover, clinically relevant read-outs for the activity of the renin-angiotensin system may be regulated multifactorially or only indirectly affected by the system. Nevertheless, the undisputable, profound biochemical changes in the renin-angiotensin system related to the estrogen status allow speculation that such interaction explains some of the differences in the cardiovascular system of men and women."

In the current population-based study, it was our objective to evaluate the implications of gender on the association between impaired left ventricular (LV) function and mass as well as neurohumoral activation.A total of 1883 subjects (992 female, 891 male) of two MONICA surveys in Augsburg, Germany, were analyzed. Participants of one of these surveys were additionally characterized with respect to neurohormonal activation. As compared to men, women were characterized by a slightly higher LV ejection fraction (EF, Teichholz-Method, 65.4 +/- 0.3% vs. 63.4 +/- 0.3, P<0.01) and a markedly lower LV mass index (LVMI 81 +/- 1 g/m(2) vs. 96 +/- 1, P<0.01). As compared to men with normal LV function, those with LV dysfunction (EF below mean minus two standard deviations, S.D.) were characterized by significantly increased LV mass (LVMI +48%, P<0.01), plasma BNP (+373%, P<0.01) and ANP (+57%, P<0.01), while no significant changes were observed in women (LVMI +3%, BNP +48%, ANP +27%, all P=n.s). Only a small subgroup of women with severe LVD (EF below mean - 3 S.D.) was characterized by significantly increased LV mass (LVMI +23%, P<0.05 vs. control and LVD), however, this increase was less pronounced as compared to men with severe LVD (LVMI +46%, P<0.01 vs. control). Gender-specific differences between LV function and structure were also confirmed by multivariate analysis. While LVMI was independently and significantly correlated with EF in male subjects in addition to systolic blood pressure, age, and body mass index (all P<0.01), these parameters displaced EF as a predictor of LVMI in female subjects.Men with moderate or severe LV dysfunction are characterized by an increase in both LV mass and cardiac natriuretic peptide plasma concentrations. In contrast, LV mass and natriuretic peptide concentrations increase to a lesser extent and only with severe LV dysfunction in women. These observational data suggest gender-specific control of myocardial adaptations to hemodynamic overload and a more rapid induction of LV hypertrophy during myocardial dysfunction in male subjects."

Myocardial UTN expression is upregulated in heart failure, and UTN stimulates myocardial expression of the natriuretic peptides. We investigated plasma UTN levels in heart failure (HF; left ventricular systolic dysfunction) in comparison with plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (N-BNP) levels.N-BNP and UTN were measured in plasma from 126 patients with HF and 220 age- and sex-matched controls. Both peptides were elevated in plasma of HF patients and were correlated (r(s)=0.35, P<0.001). In contrast to N-BNP, there was no relationship of plasma UTN with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. Although plasma N-BNP showed a positive relationship with age and female sex, there was no such age-dependent change in plasma UTN, and control women had lower levels compared with control men. Receiver operating characteristic curves for the diagnosis of HF had areas of 0.90 and 0.86 for N-BNP and UTN, respectively (P<0.001 for both). Receiver operating characteristic curve area for diagnosis of NYHA class I HF with UTN was better than that with N-BNP.Plasma UTN is elevated in HF, which suggests a pathophysiological role for this peptide. Plasma UTN may be a useful alternative to N-BNP in the diagnosis of HF, inasmuch as its levels are elevated irrespective of age, sex, or NYHA class."

Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) have a high prevalence of ventricular ectopy. However, it is not known if sex related differences exist in the susceptibility to arrhythmias in the setting of CHF. The study population included 159 men and 77 women (mean age 61 +/- 14 years) admitted for decompensated CHF. The severity of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias was assessed by 24-hour Holter monitoring. None of the patients were on parenteral vasoactive therapy during Holter recording. All measures of ventricular ectopy were markedly lower in women compared to men. The mean hourly ventricular pairs (283 +/- 67 vs 106 +/- 30, P = 0.04), mean hourly repetitive ventricular beats (28 +/- 7 vs 10 +/- 3, P = 0.04), and the frequency of ventricular tachycardia episodes per 24 hours (31 +/- 9 vs 7 +/- 3, P = 0.01) were significantly lower in women. After inclusion of clinical variables and drug therapies in a multivariate analysis, the negative relationship between female sex and the frequency of ventricular pairs (P = 0.04), repetitive ventricular beats (P = 0.04), and ventricular tachycardia episodes (P = 0.0005) remained independent. No differences in atrial ectopy between men and woman were found. Complex ventricular ectopy and episodes of ventricular tachycardia are significantly lower in women with CHF. Whether these finding are relevant to female survival advantage in the setting of heartfailure can only be determined by a prospective study. Further understanding of the mechanisms involved in the protection conferred by the patient's sex would advance our understanding about arrhythmias in heart failure."

At 3 months of age, the increased EC(50) level of SR Ca(2+) uptake for Ca(2+) (0.67 +/- 0.09 microm) resulted in significantly higher depression of cardiomyocyte rates of shortening (57%), relengthening (31%), and prolongation of the Ca(2+) signal decay time (165%) than overexpression (2-fold) of wild type phospholamban (68%, 64%, and 125%, respectively), compared with controls (100%). Echocardiography also revealed significantly depressed function and impaired beta-adrenergic responses in mutant hearts. The depressed contractile parameters were associated with left ventricular remodeling, recapitulation of fetal gene expression, and hypertrophy, which progressed to dilated cardiomyopathy with interstitial tissue fibrosis and death by 6 months in males. Females also had ventricular hypertrophy at 3 months but exhibited normal systolic function up to 12 months of age. These results suggest a causal relationship between defective SR Ca(2+) cycling and cardiac remodeling leading to heart failure, with a gender-dependent influence on the time course of these alterations."

Each year, about 400,000 individuals develop heart failure, making it the nation's most rapidly growing cardiac problem. Almost one third of these individuals have New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV heart failure and are faced with progressive clinical deterioration and frequent hospital admissions. These figures will continue to escalate as the population ages. The success of interventional procedures and pharmacologic therapies in the management of coronary artery disease has enabled this population to survive acute events, at the same time creating a population with chronic disease. Common etiologies of heart failure in women include coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and valvular disease. However, women are at especially high risk for developing heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction associated with hypertension and diabetes. Heart failure in women is best managed across the care continuum, incorporating pharmacologic agents, interventional procedures when appropriate, dietary restrictions, self-monitoring, and psychosocial support. Much of the recent literature has focused on women and heart disease. This emphasis is partly due to public misconception about women's health problems and the growing body of research distinguishing gender differences. Significant advances in therapy have been made to improve the quality and span of life for people with heart disease. Despite therapeutic advances, however, women have high mortality rates from heart disease, including heart failure due to ischemic causes. In fact, women with heart failure present differently than men and have different etiologies and treatment options. As we learn more about women and heart disease, the distinguishing differences unfold and become helpful in establishing a plan of care."

Whether cardiac myocytes are terminally differentiated cells is still a highly controversial issue, and the possibility of myocyte division is frequently rejected. On this basis, telomerase was measured in pure preparations of myocytes, isolated from rats throughout their lifespan. Fetal and neonatal rat myocytes were used as positive control cells. Contrary to expectation, the authors report that telomerase activity was detectable in pure preparations of young adult, fully mature adult, and senescent ventricular myocytes, defeating the dogma that this cell population is permanent and irreplaceable. Aging decreased 31% telomerase activity in male myocytes. An opposite effect occurred in female myocytes in which this enzyme increased 72%. This differential adaptation between the two genders in the rat model may be relevant to observations in humans; myocyte loss occurs in men as a function of age, whereas myocyte number is preserved in women. The greater growth potential of female myocytes may be critical for the longer lifespan and decreased incidence of heart failure in women."

Hospital admissions, which account for the bulk of health service costs associated with heart failure, are becoming more frequent.To determine whether management of heart failure differs by age and sex.A retrospective case note review of prevalent cases in 16 general practices in West London. Five hundred and eighty-three patients (57% women) with a diagnosis of heart failure were reviewed.Mean age of patients with heart failure was 78 years (SD = 9.5)--74 years at diagnosis (SD = 10)--and was higher for women than men (76 years versus 71 years, P < 0.001). In 32% of patients there was no record of a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, or echocardiogram to support diagnosis. Echocardiography, performed in 34% of patients, was less likely in older patients in both sexes (test for trend P = 0.04 in women and 0.02 in men) and, overall, in women (29% compared with 40% of men, P = 0.006). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment, recorded in 54% of patients, decreased with age in both sexes (P < 0.001) and, on unadjusted data, was more likely in men than in women (61% compared with 49%, P = 0.005). On adjustment for age, sex differences in the use of echocardiography and ACE inhibitors were reduced and no longer significant.With increasing age, men and women with heart failure were less likely to have undergone echocardiography or to have received an ACE inhibitor. When account was taken of age, there were no statistically significant sex differences in management; however, because of the demographic distribution of heart failure, women are disproportionately affected by age differences in management. Clinical trials, physician practice, and service developments in heart failure have neglected older people. This balance should be redressed."

Yet there are no adequate data to guide treatment of the more typical and complex cases of patients who are very old and frail.Using the SAGE database, we studied the cases of 86,094 patients with CHF admitted to any of the 1492 long-term care facilities of 5 states from 1992 through 1996. We described their clinical and functional characteristics and their pharmacologic treatment to verify agreement with widely approved guidelines. We evaluated age- and sex-related differences, and we determined predictors of receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor by developing a multiple logistic regression model.The mean age of the population was 84.9 +/- 8 years. Eighty percent of the patients 85 years of age or older were women. More than two thirds of patients underwent frequent hospitalizations related to CHF in the year preceding admission to a long-term care facility. Coronary heart disease and hypertension were the most common causes. Half of the patients received digoxin and 45% a diuretic, regardless of background cardiovascular comorbidities. Only 25% of patients had a prescription for ACE inhibitors. The presence of cardiovascular comorbidity, already being a recipient of a large number of medications, a previous hospitalization for CHF, and admission to the facility in recent years were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving an ACE inhibitor. The presence of severe physical limitation was inversely related to use of ACE inhibitors, as were a series of organizational factors related to the facilities.Patients in long-term care who have CHF little resemble to those enrolled in randomized trials. This circumstance may explain, at least in part, the divergence from pharmacologic management consensus guidelines. Yet the prescription of ACE inhibitors varies significantly across facilities and depends on organizational characteristics."

The remodeling of extracellular matrix, is a structural correlate of heart failure of ischemic origin and proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts is a key factor in this remodeling. We asked if proliferative response of male and female cardiac fibroblasts is differentially susceptible to hypoxia. DNA synthesis, using 3H-thymidine incorporation was compared under hypoxia (2% O2) in cardiac fibroblasts obtained from adult, age-matched male and female rat heart. In female cells DNA synthesis remained unchanged under hypoxia and this resistance was dependent on tyrosine kinase activation, as it was abolished in the presence of genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Male cells, on the other hand, were susceptible to hypoxia and their DNA synthesis was reduced significantly (70%, (p < 0.0001). This effect was partially reversed by inhibition of tyrosine kinase. Western analysis showed a higher abundance of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in male cells compared to female cells as well as differences in molecular weight of basal and hypoxia-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins between male and female cells. The presence of estrogen (17-beta estradiol, 10 nM) altered the response of both cells to hypoxia. In female cells the combined effect of hypoxia and estrogen led to inhibition of DNA synthesis, whereas in male cells estrogen partially reversed the hypoxia-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis (37% (p < 0.01) inhibition in the presence of estrogen vs. 70% (p < 0.0001) inhibition in the absence of estrogen). The effects of estrogen in male and female cells were mediated via estrogen receptors as they were reversed by the pure anti-estrogen, ICI 182,780. Western analysis of cell lysate showed hypoxia-induced increase in the level of estrogen receptor beta in both male and female cells. Gel shift analysis showed hypoxia-induced increase in cytoplasmic ERE (estrogen response element)-binding activity and decrease in nuclear ERE-binding in male cells. In female cells cytoplasmic and nuclear ERE-binding activities remained unchanged under hypoxia. Together, these data demonstrate that while female cells are resistant to hypoxia-induced inhibition in DNA synthesis, male cells are susceptible; intracellular pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation are involved in the response of both cells; and estrogen, via estrogen-receptor-dependent mechanisms, differentially alters the response of male and female cells to hypoxia."

In our murine model of dilated cardiomyopathy arising from cardiac-specific overexpression of TNF-alpha, the 6-month survival rate was significantly better in females than in males. Young female transgenic mice exhibited left ventricular wall thickening without dilatation, whereas age-matched male transgenic hearts were markedly dilated. Basal and isoproterenol-stimulated fractional shortening was preserved in female transgenic mice, but not in male transgenic mice. Myocardial expression of proinflammatory cytokines and the extent of myocardial infiltrates were similar in male and female transgenic mice. Myocardial expression of TNF-receptor mRNAs (type I and type II) was significantly higher in male mice in both transgenic and wild-type littermates, whereas sex-specific differences were not observed in either peripheral white blood cells or liver tissue. After TNF-alpha challenge, myocardial but not liver production of ceramide was significantly higher in male than in female mice. Thus, differential expression of myocardial TNF receptors may contribute to sex differences in the severity of congestive heart failure and mortality consequent to cardiac-specific overexpression of TNF-alpha."

Myocyte death occurs in heart failure, but only apoptosis has been documented; the role of myocyte necrosis is unknown. Therefore, we tested whether necrosis is as important as apoptosis and whether myocyte death is lower in women than in men with heart failure. Molecular probes were used to measure the magnitude of myocyte necrosis and apoptosis in 7 women and 12 men undergoing transplantation for cardiac failure. Myocyte necrosis was evaluated by detection of DNA damage with blunt end fragments, whereas apoptosis was assessed by the identification of double-strand DNA cleavage with single base or longer 3' overhangs. An identical analysis of these forms of cell death was performed in control myocardium. Heart failure showed levels of myocyte necrosis 7-fold greater than apoptosis in patients of both sexes. However, cell death was 2-fold higher in men than in women. Heart failure resulted in a 13-fold and 27-fold increase in necrosis in women and men, respectively. Apoptosis increased 35-fold in women and 85-fold in men. The differences in cell death between women and men were confirmed by the electrophoretic pattern of DNA diffusion and laddering of isolated myocytes. The lower degree of cell death in women was associated with a longer duration of the myopathy, a later onset of cardiac decompensation, and a longer interval between heart failure and transplantation. In conclusion, myocyte necrosis and apoptosis affect the decompensated human heart; each contributes to the evolution of cardiac failure. However, the female heart is protected, at least in part, from necrotic and apoptotic death signals."

However, little and conflicting data exist about sex differences in the care and outcome of elderly patients with heart failure.We compared mortality rate, readmission, and use of selected treatments and procedures between women and men in a database of 2445 patients (1426 women) aged >/=65 admitted for heart failure to 18 Connecticut hospitals in 1994 and 1995. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from the medical records.Women were older and more likely to have a history of hypertension whereas men more often had previous coronary heart disease. Women had more preserved left ventricular systolic function and higher systolic blood pressure on presentation than men. Treatments on day 1 (aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, and diuretics), procedures during admission (assessment of left ventricular function, coronary angiography, and revascularization), and use of ACE inhibitors among ideal candidates at discharge were similar in men and women. Six-month rehospitalization rates were also similar. Although 30-day mortality rate did not differ between men and women, 6-month and 1-year mortality rates were lower in women after age adjustment (relative risk for 6-month death 0.81, 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.95). In multivariable analysis, sex differences in mortality rate were reduced (relative risk 0.90, 95% confidence intervals, 0.75-1.08). History of hypertension, systolic blood pressure on admission, and left ventricular function mostly explained the observed sex differences in mortality rate.Female and male patients hospitalized for heart failure have a similar hospital course, treatment pattern, and readmission rates, but women live longer than men. When baseline differences are accounted for, the mortality risk of women and men becomes very similar."

Echocardiograms and myocyte growth were compared between males and females at compensated (2, 4, and 6 months) and decompensated (18 months in males and 24 months in females) stages of cardiac hypertrophy. Although left ventricular diastolic dimensions did not differ significantly between failing male and female rats, fractional shortening declined significantly only in failing males. Myocyte cross-sectional area did not change after 4 months of age in both genders, which is likely to be responsible for the absence of a change in left ventricular wall thickness during the progression to heart failure. Myocyte volume and cross-sectional area were significantly larger in males than females at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, although there were no significant differences at the failing stage. Reduced adaptive hypertrophic reserve was observed in males, which is likely to contribute to the higher morbidity and mortality of males with chronic heart failure."

Women rated the quality of inpatient care lower than men and also tended to rate the quality of follow-up outpatient care lower.One-year mortality was high and health-related quality of life was low in patients admitted with heart failure.

The patients underwent a physical examination and completed a set of questionnaires. Prevalence of depressive symptoms and the association of these symptoms with NYHA class and patient's perceived functional status was studied.Findings indicate that depressive symptoms were not predominant among this sample of CHF patients. Path analyses showed non-significant direct associations between NYHA class as well as patient's perception of dyspnea with depression. In contract, the subjective indicator of physical limitations was strongly associated with symptoms of depression among the males, but this relation was not significant among the females.Results suggest that men and women respond differently to the burden of heart failure.

In studies of these changes, ventricular afterload is incompletely defined by brachial blood pressure (BP) measurements. We hypothesized that there exist gender differences in pulsatile vascular load, as revealed by pressure waveform analysis, which may produce suboptimal afterload conditions in women.Data from 350 healthy normotensive subjects (187 female) aged 2 to 81 years were analyzed in decade groups. Augmentation index (AIx, the difference between early and late pressure peaks divided by pulse pressure) was used as an index of pulsatile afterload, and the ratio of diastolic to systolic pressure-time integral gave a subendocardial viability index. Heart rate, BP, ejection duration and maximal rate of pressure rise (dP/dt(max)) were also determined.Male subjects had a slightly higher systolic pressure until age 50. Female subjects had higher systolic pressure augmentation after the 1st decade, a difference that was significant after age 30 (p < 0.005 for each decade). In both males and females there was a strong age dependence for AIx (r = 0.77, p < 0.001 for females, r = 0.66, p < 0.001 for males). Although males had a larger body size and higher systolic pressure, systolic pressure-time integral was similar in males and females across all age groups. Diastolic pressure-time integral was consistently lower in females because of their shorter diastolic period. Subendocardial viability index was lower in females across the entire group. Differences in stature and heart rate may contribute to these findings.These new data may help to explain previous findings in women of an age-related increase in LV mass and excess symptomatic heart failure that are not explained by differences in brachial BP."

Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques that have enabled earlier identification of patients with IDCM, the etiology of the disease in most patients remains unknown. The current 5-year survival rate for patients with asymptomatic IDCM approaches 80%; this is a significant improvement compared with earlier reports of the natural history of IDCM. Men are more commonly afflicted with IDCM, but women with IDCM tend to present with more advanced disease. Recent analysis of 3-year transplant-free survival reveals no gender differences, however. Survival in children with IDCM is variable; 30% of infants die within 2 years of diagnosis, but 5-year survival for childhood IDCM is 60% to 84%. An association of IDCM with the peripartum period is well recognized. The etiology of peripartum cardiomyopathy remains unknown, and some cases are familial. This disease is reversible in approximately 50% of patients, and in patients with intractable congestive heart failure, cardiac transplantation is a viable treatment option. AIDS has been more recently associated with IDCM. Acute left ventricular dysfunction and consequent dilated cardiomyopathy occur with increased frequency in patients with advanced AIDS. The etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy in HIV-infected patients is presently poorly understood. Survival for patients with AIDS after development of left ventricular dysfunction is extremely poor."

We prospectively evaluated 386 individuals < 70 years of age (295 men, 91 women) referred for management of moderate to severe heart failure and/or cardiac transplant evaluation. Age, race, sex, heart failure type, New York Heart Association class, left ventricular ejection fraction, peak exercise oxygen consumption, disease duration, resting hemodynamic measurements, comorbidity index score, health insurance coverage, and estimated household income were recorded. For patients not accepted for transplantation, the reason for rejection was also obtained. Univariable and multivariable (logistic regression) analyses were performed comparing men and women and patients accepted and those not accepted for cardiac transplantation. Female sex was independently associated with rejection for cardiac transplantation (odds ratio, 2.57; P = .01). However, the reason for rejection (odds ratio, 2.57; P = .01). However, the reason for rejection was more likely to be patient self-refusal for women than for men (29% versus 9%), and female sex was independently associated with patient self-refusal (odds ratio, 4.68; P = .003). When patients who refused transplant were reclassified as accepted for transplant, female sex was no longer associated with nonacceptance. However, lower patient income was associated with nonacceptance for transplant.We found no evidence of sex bias in the selection of cardiac transplant recipients at our center. These findings suggest that the underrepresentation of women among cardiac transplant recipients may result, in part, from a sex difference in treatment preference, with a decreased willingness of women to undergo transplantation.

Although similar data are not available in humans, it seems likely that similar gender-related differences in cardiac function exist and may in part account for the observed differences in myocardial diseases in men and women. Additionally, genetic factors may contribute to these differences, as X-linked disorders may present differently in males and females. An awareness of the impact of sex-related factors is clearly important in the evaluation of any patient presenting with heart failure or cardiomyopathy and may alter both diagnostic and therapeutic considerations, as well as broaden our basic knowledge and understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in myocardial dysfunction."
